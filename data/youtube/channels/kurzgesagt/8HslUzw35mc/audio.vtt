00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Homeopathy may be the most controversial, but also the most popular alternative medicine.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
How does homeopathy work? How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
The first principle of homeopathy is like cures like.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
In practice, that means that remedies against fever could, for example, be made from belladonna, which also causes fever.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
A mixture based from bee venom is used to treat itchy swellings, and so on.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
The second principle is a special method of preparation called potentization.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
The idea is that diluting and agitating the ingredients activates their curative powers and enhances their effect.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
To do this, the ingredient is dissolved in alcohol or distilled water.

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
Homeopaths take one part of the solution and mix it with nine parts of water, diluting it down to one tenth of its original concentration and shaking it.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
What you have now is a 1X potency, one part ingredient and nine parts solvent, named after the Roman numeral X for ten.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Now this process is repeated. Take one part, mix it with nine parts of pure water and shake it vigorously.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Now you have 2X. You do this again and again until you reach the desired grade of potency.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
The finished remedy is then taken orally or sometimes it's applied as little sugar pellets that are sold as globulae.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
A 20X potency, for example, is like dissolving one aspirin pill in the water volume of the whole Atlantic.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
But many are much more extreme like 30C, for example.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
C means that the mixture has one part ingredient and 99 parts water.

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
So the commonly sold 30C mixture means one part ingredient and one million billion billion billion billion billion billion parts of water.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
If we wanted a globulae pill with a single atom of the original ingredient, then our pill would be the diameter of the distance between the Earth and the Sun.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
150 million kilometers, a pill so massive that it would collapse into a black hole under its own mass.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Because of this, potentization is one of the biggest criticisms of homeopathy.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
The extreme dilution is supposed to make the ingredients more potent, but on a physical level this doesn't really make sense.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
Most homeopathic remedies are diluted so much that not a single atom of the active ingredient is left in them.

02:41.000 --> 02:51.000
The explanation of why the mixtures still work is that shaking the mixture after every dilution leaves behind a spirit-like essence of the ingredient.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Basically, the idea is that water remembers what was put into it.

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
But if this were true, then every substance that ever met a drop of water would leave an essence behind and lead to unpredictable effects when it was accidentally ingested.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
Think of all the stuff that lives and floats in the oceans. Every sip of water would be a supercharged homeopathic cocktail.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
So how did homeopathy become the most successful alternative medicine?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
In the 18th century, medicine was very different from today.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Treatments like bloodletting left the patient worse off than before.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
So German physician Samuel Hahnemann wanted a non-invasive, natural way of healing and developed homeopathy.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
And in fact, homeopathic hospitals were soon successful because doing no harm beats doing harm.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Hahnemann imposed very strict rules on his patients.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
First you had to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy food, sweet food, no old cheese, no onions, no meat, no clothes made from sheep's wool,

03:53.000 --> 04:06.000
but also no sedentary work, no sitting inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms, no riding horses, no napping, no playing games, no masturbation, and of course no reading pornographic texts, and many more.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Then, and only then, would his remedies work according to the inventor of homeopathy.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Medicine has changed a lot in the last 150 years.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Never before in human history have we enjoyed a comparable level of health.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Never have we lived as long.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And this is largely due to the new tools we've developed.

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
Modern diagnostics, double-blinded studies, and scientific evaluation to check and prove which stuff works.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
Thanks to these tools, after countless studies and reviews, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that homeopathy does not have any effect beyond placebo.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
But even so, who cares why it works if it helps people?

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
Maybe you tried it and felt better, or you know someone that got over a horrible disease while using homeopathic remedies,

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
and there are plenty of reports of it working for children and animals.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
What do we make of these experiences?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
The placebo effect is very real and not imaginary.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
No matter how smart you are, you're not immune to it.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
If people believe that something will help them feel better, their trust alone has the desired effect.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And it's been proven that the placebo effect can be transferred.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Children and animals rely on their parents or keepers and are in tune to their emotions.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
If a parent has a lot of trust in a treatment and eases up, this can help a child relax and help relieve symptoms.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
This can also be observed with animals who react strongly to the body language cues of the people caring for them.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But the most powerful tool of homeopathy is time.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Our bodies are survival machines.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Infections pass on their own after a few days.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
But if you take some remedy when you already feel sick and then start getting better,

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
it feels like it did indeed cure you, while actually it would have happened anyway.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
The homeopathy industry likes to play the gentle alternative to Big Pharma.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
But the homeopathic industry is Big Pharma.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Billions of dollars are made with extreme profit margins.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
The homeopathy industry has its own lobby organizations and fights its enemies as hard as it can.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
A lot of money is on the line.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Globally, the market is expected to reach over 17 billion by 2024.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
Some critics even argue that the homeopathic industry is bad for public health because it creates distrust in proven medicine.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
The belief in homeopathy correlates with skepticism about vaccinations.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
This can discourage people to seek the help they need when their lives or the lives of their children are on the line.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
But there is actually a key to the success of homeopathy that we could and should copy.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
The first consultation with a homeopath can take hours and is very personal.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
For a patient who's already been on a pilgrimage from doctor to doctor,

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
this level of attention and empathy can make a huge difference to their well-being,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
even if the conversation was not the point of the therapy.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Modern medicine is efficient.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It saves millions of lives each year.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
But it's also a strictly organized system.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Time budgets force doctors and nurses to deal with lots of patients.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Consultations need to be time-efficient, diagnoses made quickly, treatments fast,

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
which can leave patients feeling invisible, scared, and left behind.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
This is what modern medicine can learn from homeopathy.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It meets a human need that has been left unfulfilled.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
We need to make time for the individual again, see people, not numbers.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
But as important as empathy is, it's not a substitute for actual treatment.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Faith can move mountains, but sugar water can't cure cancer.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
After a short break and a few years, Kurzgesagt is back in German.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Thanks to the support of Funk, we have relaunched the German channel

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
and are beginning to upload a video every one to two weeks.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
Besides redoing our favorite videos, there will be a number of videos that will not exist in English for a while.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Check out the channel here, tell us what you think, and subscribe and watch a few.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
If the channel goes well, the German videos might become a regular thing for years,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
and we might even do more languages.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Thank you for watching!
