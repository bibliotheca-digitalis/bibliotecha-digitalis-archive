0	6000	Homeopathy may be the most controversial, but also the most popular alternative medicine.
6000	12000	While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness.
12000	20000	How does homeopathy work? How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it?
30000	34000	The first principle of homeopathy is like cures like.
34000	38000	Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure.
38000	46000	In practice, that means that remedies against fever could, for example, be made from belladonna, which also causes fever.
46000	51000	A mixture based from bee venom is used to treat itchy swellings, and so on.
51000	55000	The second principle is a special method of preparation called potentization.
55000	62000	The idea is that diluting and agitating the ingredients activates their curative powers and enhances their effect.
62000	66000	To do this, the ingredient is dissolved in alcohol or distilled water.
66000	75000	Homeopaths take one part of the solution and mix it with nine parts of water, diluting it down to one tenth of its original concentration and shaking it.
75000	83000	What you have now is a 1X potency, one part ingredient and nine parts solvent, named after the Roman numeral X for ten.
83000	90000	Now this process is repeated. Take one part, mix it with nine parts of pure water and shake it vigorously.
90000	96000	Now you have 2X. You do this again and again until you reach the desired grade of potency.
96000	102000	The finished remedy is then taken orally or sometimes it's applied as little sugar pellets that are sold as globulae.
102000	109000	A 20X potency, for example, is like dissolving one aspirin pill in the water volume of the whole Atlantic.
109000	113000	But many are much more extreme like 30C, for example.
113000	117000	C means that the mixture has one part ingredient and 99 parts water.
117000	127000	So the commonly sold 30C mixture means one part ingredient and one million billion billion billion billion billion billion parts of water.
127000	135000	If we wanted a globulae pill with a single atom of the original ingredient, then our pill would be the diameter of the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
136000	143000	150 million kilometers, a pill so massive that it would collapse into a black hole under its own mass.
143000	147000	Because of this, potentization is one of the biggest criticisms of homeopathy.
147000	155000	The extreme dilution is supposed to make the ingredients more potent, but on a physical level this doesn't really make sense.
155000	161000	Most homeopathic remedies are diluted so much that not a single atom of the active ingredient is left in them.
161000	171000	The explanation of why the mixtures still work is that shaking the mixture after every dilution leaves behind a spirit-like essence of the ingredient.
171000	175000	Basically, the idea is that water remembers what was put into it.
175000	185000	But if this were true, then every substance that ever met a drop of water would leave an essence behind and lead to unpredictable effects when it was accidentally ingested.
185000	192000	Think of all the stuff that lives and floats in the oceans. Every sip of water would be a supercharged homeopathic cocktail.
192000	196000	So how did homeopathy become the most successful alternative medicine?
198000	201000	In the 18th century, medicine was very different from today.
201000	205000	Treatments like bloodletting left the patient worse off than before.
205000	212000	So German physician Samuel Hahnemann wanted a non-invasive, natural way of healing and developed homeopathy.
213000	220000	And in fact, homeopathic hospitals were soon successful because doing no harm beats doing harm.
220000	223000	Hahnemann imposed very strict rules on his patients.
223000	233000	First you had to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy food, sweet food, no old cheese, no onions, no meat, no clothes made from sheep's wool,
233000	246000	but also no sedentary work, no sitting inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms, no riding horses, no napping, no playing games, no masturbation, and of course no reading pornographic texts, and many more.
246000	251000	Then, and only then, would his remedies work according to the inventor of homeopathy.
251000	256000	Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today.
256000	260000	Medicine has changed a lot in the last 150 years.
260000	264000	Never before in human history have we enjoyed a comparable level of health.
265000	267000	Never have we lived as long.
267000	270000	And this is largely due to the new tools we've developed.
270000	277000	Modern diagnostics, double-blinded studies, and scientific evaluation to check and prove which stuff works.
277000	286000	Thanks to these tools, after countless studies and reviews, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that homeopathy does not have any effect beyond placebo.
286000	290000	But even so, who cares why it works if it helps people?
290000	297000	Maybe you tried it and felt better, or you know someone that got over a horrible disease while using homeopathic remedies,
297000	301000	and there are plenty of reports of it working for children and animals.
301000	303000	What do we make of these experiences?
303000	307000	The placebo effect is very real and not imaginary.
307000	310000	No matter how smart you are, you're not immune to it.
310000	315000	If people believe that something will help them feel better, their trust alone has the desired effect.
315000	318000	And it's been proven that the placebo effect can be transferred.
318000	324000	Children and animals rely on their parents or keepers and are in tune to their emotions.
324000	330000	If a parent has a lot of trust in a treatment and eases up, this can help a child relax and help relieve symptoms.
330000	337000	This can also be observed with animals who react strongly to the body language cues of the people caring for them.
337000	341000	But the most powerful tool of homeopathy is time.
341000	343000	Our bodies are survival machines.
343000	346000	Infections pass on their own after a few days.
346000	350000	But if you take some remedy when you already feel sick and then start getting better,
350000	354000	it feels like it did indeed cure you, while actually it would have happened anyway.
354000	359000	The homeopathy industry likes to play the gentle alternative to Big Pharma.
359000	362000	But the homeopathic industry is Big Pharma.
362000	365000	Billions of dollars are made with extreme profit margins.
365000	371000	The homeopathy industry has its own lobby organizations and fights its enemies as hard as it can.
371000	373000	A lot of money is on the line.
373000	379000	Globally, the market is expected to reach over 17 billion by 2024.
379000	387000	Some critics even argue that the homeopathic industry is bad for public health because it creates distrust in proven medicine.
387000	391000	The belief in homeopathy correlates with skepticism about vaccinations.
391000	398000	This can discourage people to seek the help they need when their lives or the lives of their children are on the line.
398000	405000	But there is actually a key to the success of homeopathy that we could and should copy.
405000	410000	The first consultation with a homeopath can take hours and is very personal.
410000	413000	For a patient who's already been on a pilgrimage from doctor to doctor,
413000	418000	this level of attention and empathy can make a huge difference to their well-being,
418000	421000	even if the conversation was not the point of the therapy.
421000	423000	Modern medicine is efficient.
423000	426000	It saves millions of lives each year.
426000	429000	But it's also a strictly organized system.
429000	433000	Time budgets force doctors and nurses to deal with lots of patients.
433000	439000	Consultations need to be time-efficient, diagnoses made quickly, treatments fast,
439000	444000	which can leave patients feeling invisible, scared, and left behind.
444000	447000	This is what modern medicine can learn from homeopathy.
447000	451000	It meets a human need that has been left unfulfilled.
452000	456000	We need to make time for the individual again, see people, not numbers.
456000	461000	But as important as empathy is, it's not a substitute for actual treatment.
461000	467000	Faith can move mountains, but sugar water can't cure cancer.
470000	474000	After a short break and a few years, Kurzgesagt is back in German.
474000	478000	Thanks to the support of Funk, we have relaunched the German channel
478000	481000	and are beginning to upload a video every one to two weeks.
481000	487000	Besides redoing our favorite videos, there will be a number of videos that will not exist in English for a while.
487000	492000	Check out the channel here, tell us what you think, and subscribe and watch a few.
492000	497000	If the channel goes well, the German videos might become a regular thing for years,
497000	500000	and we might even do more languages.
508000	511000	Thank you for watching!
