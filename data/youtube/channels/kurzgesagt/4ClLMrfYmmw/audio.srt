00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
The 12,018 Human Era Calendar is out now.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,640
You can order the limited edition for the short time of 10 days, and then never again.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,800
It's like a regular calendar for 2018, but with one important difference.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,040
It's for the year 12,018 of the Human Era.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,280
We explained why this should be our current year in our A New Calendar for Humanity video.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,600
Last year's calendar got a lot of feedback, and we listened to what you wanted.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
The 12,018 calendar has much more room for notes, a spiral binding,

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,000
we got the shipping costs down, and it will arrive in time for Christmas.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
It's printed on high-quality paper, has a gold cover, and it was produced in Seattle,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,400
so we could ensure Kurzgesagt quality.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,800
The calendar itself features 12 detailed illustrations of human cultures around the world.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Order it now. It's available for the limited time of 10 days until October the 20th.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,400
The Human Era Calendar is a passion project for us that represents the idea of human unity and progress,

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,400
and that we need to work together to stay alive and to travel to the stars.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
It's the second time we've made one, and we're trying to make this a regular thing.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Thanks a lot to everyone who loves the idea of a new history.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,600
We couldn't do any of this without this group of like-minded humans around the world.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Bark, bark!
