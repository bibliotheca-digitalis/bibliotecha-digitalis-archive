00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
The 12,018 Human Era Calendar is out now.

00:03.440 --> 00:07.640
You can order the limited edition for the short time of 10 days, and then never again.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.800
It's like a regular calendar for 2018, but with one important difference.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.040
It's for the year 12,018 of the Human Era.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.280
We explained why this should be our current year in our A New Calendar for Humanity video.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.600
Last year's calendar got a lot of feedback, and we listened to what you wanted.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.800
The 12,018 calendar has much more room for notes, a spiral binding,

00:30.800 --> 00:35.000
we got the shipping costs down, and it will arrive in time for Christmas.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.000
It's printed on high-quality paper, has a gold cover, and it was produced in Seattle,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.400
so we could ensure Kurzgesagt quality.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.800
The calendar itself features 12 detailed illustrations of human cultures around the world.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.000
Order it now. It's available for the limited time of 10 days until October the 20th.

00:53.800 --> 00:59.400
The Human Era Calendar is a passion project for us that represents the idea of human unity and progress,

00:59.400 --> 01:03.400
and that we need to work together to stay alive and to travel to the stars.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.000
It's the second time we've made one, and we're trying to make this a regular thing.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.400
Thanks a lot to everyone who loves the idea of a new history.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.600
We couldn't do any of this without this group of like-minded humans around the world.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Bark, bark!
