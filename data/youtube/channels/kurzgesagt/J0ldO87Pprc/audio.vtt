00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
What would happen if you were to bring a tiny piece of the Sun to Earth?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.500
Short answer, you'd die.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.000
Long answer, it depends which piece of the Sun.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.500
Like most of the matter in the universe, our Sun is neither solid, liquid, or gas, but plasma.

00:16.500 --> 00:23.000
Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
which creates a goo-like substance.

00:25.500 --> 00:31.500
So you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.000
The deeper you go, the denser and weirder the goo becomes.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
So let's bring three samples, each the size of a house, to our lab here on Earth and see what happens.

00:42.000 --> 00:56.000
First sample, the chromosphere.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.500
The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, a layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 km deep

01:02.500 --> 01:07.000
that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.500
It's pretty hot here, between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius,

01:11.500 --> 01:15.500
but if we brought a sample of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth.

01:15.500 --> 01:21.000
In the area where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air,

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
so compared to our atmosphere at sea level, it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode.

01:33.500 --> 01:40.500
Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kg of TNT in the process.

01:40.500 --> 01:47.000
This creates a high-pressure shockwave which shatters glass, ruptures eardrums and maybe some internal organs.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
If you're standing too close, it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Let's go deeper.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Second sample, the photosphere.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.500
Beneath the chromosphere is the glowing surface of the Sun, the photosphere, which produces the light we see.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.500
It's covered in a grid of a million hotspots called granules,

02:06.500 --> 02:12.000
each of them about as big as the United States and over 5,000 degrees Celsius.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
These granules are the tops of convective columns,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
In these columns, a few hundred kilometers down, we take our second plasma sample.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on Earth.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Though still much less dense than air, its heat supports it, so it won't implode.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kg of TNT, but this time as heat.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
instantly lighting fires throughout our lab.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But a few milliseconds later, those fires are all that's left.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
What if we go deeper?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Third sample, the radiative zone.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Here, the plasma is about 2 million degrees Celsius and so dense and tightly packed

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
that it creates a sort of maze for itself.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
bouncing endlessly from particle to particle until it eventually finds an exit.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
Bringing matter from here to our lab is what experts call a very bad idea.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Our lab, as well as the city around it, will be destroyed in an instant.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
What if we go much, much deeper?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Last sample, the core.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Here, in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the Sun's mass.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen powering the Sun by nuclear fusion.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
or a cube the size of the Empire State Building.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
This is 4 billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
To give you a sense of scale, this is the cube inside Manhattan.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super-dense matter expands instantly

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
and creates an explosion with the force of, well, the Sun.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
If we get the sample in Paris in the morning, the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
but one that gets brighter and brighter and hotter and hotter until London burns to ashes.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
In a radius of about 300 kilometers around the blast, everything would be burnt.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
and windows break across the continent.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
The explosion would be apocalyptic, possibly human civilization ending.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
to control human-caused climate change for a few decades.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude that we should not try to bring the Sun to Earth.
