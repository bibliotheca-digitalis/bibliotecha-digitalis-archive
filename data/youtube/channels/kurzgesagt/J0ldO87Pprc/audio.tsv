0	4500	What would happen if you were to bring a tiny piece of the Sun to Earth?
4500	6500	Short answer, you'd die.
6500	10000	Long answer, it depends which piece of the Sun.
10000	16500	Like most of the matter in the universe, our Sun is neither solid, liquid, or gas, but plasma.
16500	23000	Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,
23000	25000	which creates a goo-like substance.
25500	31500	So you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo.
31500	36000	The deeper you go, the denser and weirder the goo becomes.
36000	42000	So let's bring three samples, each the size of a house, to our lab here on Earth and see what happens.
42000	56000	First sample, the chromosphere.
56000	62500	The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, a layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 km deep
62500	67000	that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth.
67500	71500	It's pretty hot here, between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius,
71500	75500	but if we brought a sample of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth.
75500	81000	In the area where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air,
81000	87000	so compared to our atmosphere at sea level, it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth.
87000	93000	The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode.
93500	100500	Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kg of TNT in the process.
100500	107000	This creates a high-pressure shockwave which shatters glass, ruptures eardrums and maybe some internal organs.
107000	112000	If you're standing too close, it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance.
112000	114000	Let's go deeper.
114000	117000	Second sample, the photosphere.
117000	123500	Beneath the chromosphere is the glowing surface of the Sun, the photosphere, which produces the light we see.
123500	126500	It's covered in a grid of a million hotspots called granules,
126500	132000	each of them about as big as the United States and over 5,000 degrees Celsius.
132000	135000	These granules are the tops of convective columns,
135000	139000	churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface.
139000	144000	In these columns, a few hundred kilometers down, we take our second plasma sample.
144000	147000	It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on Earth.
147000	152000	Though still much less dense than air, its heat supports it, so it won't implode.
152000	160000	Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kg of TNT, but this time as heat.
160000	166000	For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth,
166000	169000	instantly lighting fires throughout our lab.
169000	172000	But a few milliseconds later, those fires are all that's left.
172000	177000	The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins.
177000	179000	What if we go deeper?
180000	183000	Third sample, the radiative zone.
183000	188000	Here, the plasma is about 2 million degrees Celsius and so dense and tightly packed
188000	191000	that it creates a sort of maze for itself.
191000	196000	Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years,
196000	201000	bouncing endlessly from particle to particle until it eventually finds an exit.
201000	207000	Bringing matter from here to our lab is what experts call a very bad idea.
207000	212000	As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone,
212000	216000	and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon.
216000	220000	Our lab, as well as the city around it, will be destroyed in an instant.
220000	223000	On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout.
223000	228000	With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today.
228000	231000	What if we go much, much deeper?
232000	234000	Last sample, the core.
234000	239000	Here, in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the Sun's mass.
239000	244000	The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it.
244000	248000	In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees,
248000	254000	hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen powering the Sun by nuclear fusion.
255000	261000	In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf.
261000	265000	If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience.
265000	270000	The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT,
270000	273000	or a cube the size of the Empire State Building.
273000	277000	Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons.
277000	283000	This is 4 billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high.
283000	288000	To give you a sense of scale, this is the cube inside Manhattan.
288000	293000	Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super-dense matter expands instantly
293000	298000	and creates an explosion with the force of, well, the Sun.
298000	304000	If we get the sample in Paris in the morning, the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise,
304000	310000	but one that gets brighter and brighter and hotter and hotter until London burns to ashes.
310000	315000	In a radius of about 300 kilometers around the blast, everything would be burnt.
315000	320000	The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times.
320000	324000	Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture,
324000	327000	and windows break across the continent.
327000	332000	The explosion would be apocalyptic, possibly human civilization ending.
332000	338000	If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age.
338000	343000	So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way
343000	346000	to control human-caused climate change for a few decades.
346000	352000	While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude that we should not try to bring the Sun to Earth.
