1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
What would happen if you were to bring a tiny piece of the Sun to Earth?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Short answer, you'd die.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Long answer, it depends which piece of the Sun.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Like most of the matter in the universe, our Sun is neither solid, liquid, or gas, but plasma.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
which creates a goo-like substance.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,500
So you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,000
The deeper you go, the denser and weirder the goo becomes.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's bring three samples, each the size of a house, to our lab here on Earth and see what happens.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First sample, the chromosphere.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,500
The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, a layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 km deep

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,000
that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
It's pretty hot here, between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius,

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
but if we brought a sample of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,000
In the area where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so compared to our atmosphere at sea level, it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode.

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kg of TNT in the process.

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,000
This creates a high-pressure shockwave which shatters glass, ruptures eardrums and maybe some internal organs.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you're standing too close, it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go deeper.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Second sample, the photosphere.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,500
Beneath the chromosphere is the glowing surface of the Sun, the photosphere, which produces the light we see.

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
It's covered in a grid of a million hotspots called granules,

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,000
each of them about as big as the United States and over 5,000 degrees Celsius.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
These granules are the tops of convective columns,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In these columns, a few hundred kilometers down, we take our second plasma sample.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on Earth.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Though still much less dense than air, its heat supports it, so it won't implode.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kg of TNT, but this time as heat.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth,

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
instantly lighting fires throughout our lab.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But a few milliseconds later, those fires are all that's left.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What if we go deeper?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Third sample, the radiative zone.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Here, the plasma is about 2 million degrees Celsius and so dense and tightly packed

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that it creates a sort of maze for itself.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years,

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
bouncing endlessly from particle to particle until it eventually finds an exit.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Bringing matter from here to our lab is what experts call a very bad idea.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone,

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Our lab, as well as the city around it, will be destroyed in an instant.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What if we go much, much deeper?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Last sample, the core.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Here, in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the Sun's mass.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees,

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen powering the Sun by nuclear fusion.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT,

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
or a cube the size of the Empire State Building.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is 4 billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
To give you a sense of scale, this is the cube inside Manhattan.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super-dense matter expands instantly

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and creates an explosion with the force of, well, the Sun.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If we get the sample in Paris in the morning, the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise,

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but one that gets brighter and brighter and hotter and hotter until London burns to ashes.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In a radius of about 300 kilometers around the blast, everything would be burnt.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture,

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and windows break across the continent.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The explosion would be apocalyptic, possibly human civilization ending.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to control human-caused climate change for a few decades.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude that we should not try to bring the Sun to Earth.
