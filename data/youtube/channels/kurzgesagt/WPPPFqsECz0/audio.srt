1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That you're not successful enough.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Your relationship's not satisfying enough.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That you don't have the things you crave.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and inwards with disappointment.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Pop culture, advertising, and social media make this worse

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you need to have great experiences constantly, be conventionally attractive,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
have a lot of friends, and find your soulmate,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and that others have all of these things and are truly happy.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And, of course, a vast array of self-improvement products

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
implies that it's all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to investigate

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
how we can counteract these impulses.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The field of positive psychology emerged,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the study of what makes life worth living,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative feelings.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Scientists began to ask,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
why are some people happier and more satisfied than others,

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and are there ways to apply what they're doing right to the rest of us?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
of how happy people are, how easily they make friends,

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and how good they are at dealing with hardship.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
An antidote to dissatisfaction, so to speak.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Gratitude.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
preached by people who use hashtags,

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
what we currently know about it is based on a body of scientific work and studies.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We'll include them in the description.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Gratitude can mean very different things to different people in different contexts.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a character trait, a feeling, a virtue, and a behavior.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can feel grateful towards someone who did something for you,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
for random events like the weather, or even for nature, or fate,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and it's wired into our biology.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How gratitude connects us to each other.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The predecessor of gratitude is probably reciprocity.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It likely evolved as a biological signal that motivates animals to exchange things

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
for their mutual benefit, and can be found in the animal kingdom

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
among certain fish, birds, or mammals, but especially in primates.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When your brain recognizes that someone's done something nice for you,

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it reacts with gratitude to motivate you to repay them.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This gratitude makes you care about others, and others care about you.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This was important because as human brains got better at reading emotions,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
selfish individuals were identified and shunned.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It became an evolutionary advantage to play well with others and build lasting relationships.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For example, if you were hungry and someone else showed you where to find tasty berries,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return the favor in the future,

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a drive to be pro-social.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When you repaid them, they felt gratitude towards you.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This brought your ancestors closer together and forged bonds and friendships.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So early forms of gratitude were biological mechanisms that modified your behavior

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
towards cooperation, which helped humans to dominate Earth.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But over time, gratitude became more than just an impulse to play fair.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Scientists found that gratitude stimulates the pathways in your brain

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting others' intentions.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It also makes it easier to save and retrieve positive memories.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even more, gratitude directly counteracts negative feelings and traits

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
like envy and social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As a consequence, people who are grateful no matter what for tend to be happier and more satisfied.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They have better relationships and easier time making friends.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They sleep better, tend to suffer less from depression, addiction, and burnout,

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and are better at dealing with traumatic events.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In a way, gratitude makes it less likely that you'll fall into one of the psychological traps modern life has set for you.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
For example, gratitude measurably counters the tendency to forget and downplay positive events.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you work long and hard for something, actually getting it can feel daft and empty.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can find yourself emotionally back where you started and try to achieve the next biggest thing,

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
looking for that satisfaction instead of being satisfied with yourself.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Or imagine being lonely and wanting to have more friends.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You actually might have someone or even multiple people who want to hang out.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you might feel that this is not enough, that you're a loser and feel bad about yourself.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So you might turn down their attempts to hang out and become more lonely.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you feel grateful for your relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of solidifying relationships and meeting new people.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In the best case, gratitude can trigger a feedback loop.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Positive feelings lead to more prosocial behavior, which leads to more positive social experiences that cause more positive feelings.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is a common experience after serious hardship like chemotherapy, for example.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Life can feel amazing after a crisis is over.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The smallest things can be bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun or chatting with a friend.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Objectively, your life is the same or maybe even slightly worse than before,

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but your brain compares your present experiences with the times when life was bad and reacts with gratitude.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, in a nutshell, gratitude refocuses your attention towards the good things you have.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And the consequences of this shift are better feelings and more positive experiences.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
While it is great to know these things, is there actually a way for you to feel more of it?

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The ability to experience more or less gratitude is not equally distributed.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You have what's known as trait gratitude that determines how much you are able to feel it.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It depends on your genetics, personality, and culture.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This discovery made scientists wonder if they could design exercises that change your trait gratitude and lead to more happiness.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's start with important caveats.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not yet entirely clear to what degree gratitude can be trained or how long the effects last.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There are no magic pills for happiness.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Life is complicated.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
On some days, it feels like you're in control of yourself, and on others, you feel like you're not.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And this is okay.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Also, sometimes pursuing happiness can make you more unhappy if you put too much pressure on yourself.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Gratitude should also not be seen as a solution to depression or a substitute for professional help.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It can only be a piece of the puzzle.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not the solution to the puzzle itself.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The easiest gratitude exercise, with the most solid research behind it, is gratitude journaling.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It means sitting down for a few minutes, one to three times a week, and writing down five to ten things you're grateful for.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It might feel weird at first, so start simply.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Can you feel grateful for a little thing, like how great coffee is or that someone was kind to you?

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can you appreciate something someone else did for you?

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you reflect on which things or people you would miss if they were gone and be grateful that they're in your life?

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We're all different, so you'll know what works for you.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And that's it, really. It feels almost insulting. Like, things shouldn't be that simple.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But in numerous studies, the participants reported more happiness and a higher general life satisfaction after doing this practice for a few weeks.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Even more, studies have found changes in brain activity some months after they ended.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Practicing gratitude may be a real way to reprogram yourself.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This research shows that your emotions are not fixed.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In the end, how you experience life is a representation of what you believe about it.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you attack your core beliefs about yourself and your life, you can change your thoughts and feelings, which automatically changes your behavior.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's pretty mind-blowing that something as simple as self-reflection can hack the pathways in our brain to fight dissatisfaction.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And if this is no reason to be more optimistic, what is?

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Being a human is hard, but it doesn't need to be as hard.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And if you actively look, you might find that your life is much better than you thought.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you're curious and want to try out gratitude, we made a thing.

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Please note that you don't need to buy anything from anyone to practice gratitude. All you need is paper, a pen, and five minutes.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Having said that, we've made a Kurzgesagt gratitude journal based on studies we've read, conversations with experts, and our personal experiences with gratitude over the last year.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's structured in a way that might make it a bit easier to get into the habit of gratitude journaling.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There are short explanations and reflections to mix it up and make it more interesting.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We've also made it as pretty as we could.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This video continues the unofficial series of more personal, introspective videos from optimistic nihilism to loneliness and now gratitude.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We don't want to be a self-help channel, so we'll keep this sort of video at roughly one per year.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We hope they're helpful to some of you.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you for watching.

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're welcome.
