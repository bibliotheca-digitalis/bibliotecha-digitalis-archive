00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
That you're not successful enough.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Your relationship's not satisfying enough.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
That you don't have the things you crave.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
and inwards with disappointment.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Pop culture, advertising, and social media make this worse

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
you need to have great experiences constantly, be conventionally attractive,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
have a lot of friends, and find your soulmate,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
and that others have all of these things and are truly happy.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
And, of course, a vast array of self-improvement products

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
implies that it's all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to investigate

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
how we can counteract these impulses.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
The field of positive psychology emerged,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
the study of what makes life worth living,

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative feelings.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Scientists began to ask,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
why are some people happier and more satisfied than others,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
and are there ways to apply what they're doing right to the rest of us?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
of how happy people are, how easily they make friends,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
and how good they are at dealing with hardship.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
An antidote to dissatisfaction, so to speak.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Gratitude.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
preached by people who use hashtags,

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
what we currently know about it is based on a body of scientific work and studies.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
We'll include them in the description.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Gratitude can mean very different things to different people in different contexts.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
It's a character trait, a feeling, a virtue, and a behavior.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
You can feel grateful towards someone who did something for you,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
for random events like the weather, or even for nature, or fate,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
and it's wired into our biology.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
How gratitude connects us to each other.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
The predecessor of gratitude is probably reciprocity.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
It likely evolved as a biological signal that motivates animals to exchange things

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
for their mutual benefit, and can be found in the animal kingdom

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
among certain fish, birds, or mammals, but especially in primates.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
When your brain recognizes that someone's done something nice for you,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
it reacts with gratitude to motivate you to repay them.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
This gratitude makes you care about others, and others care about you.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
This was important because as human brains got better at reading emotions,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
selfish individuals were identified and shunned.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
It became an evolutionary advantage to play well with others and build lasting relationships.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
For example, if you were hungry and someone else showed you where to find tasty berries,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return the favor in the future,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
a drive to be pro-social.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
When you repaid them, they felt gratitude towards you.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
This brought your ancestors closer together and forged bonds and friendships.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
So early forms of gratitude were biological mechanisms that modified your behavior

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
towards cooperation, which helped humans to dominate Earth.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
But over time, gratitude became more than just an impulse to play fair.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Scientists found that gratitude stimulates the pathways in your brain

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting others' intentions.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
It also makes it easier to save and retrieve positive memories.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Even more, gratitude directly counteracts negative feelings and traits

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
like envy and social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
As a consequence, people who are grateful no matter what for tend to be happier and more satisfied.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
They have better relationships and easier time making friends.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
They sleep better, tend to suffer less from depression, addiction, and burnout,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
and are better at dealing with traumatic events.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
In a way, gratitude makes it less likely that you'll fall into one of the psychological traps modern life has set for you.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
For example, gratitude measurably counters the tendency to forget and downplay positive events.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
If you work long and hard for something, actually getting it can feel daft and empty.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
You can find yourself emotionally back where you started and try to achieve the next biggest thing,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
looking for that satisfaction instead of being satisfied with yourself.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Or imagine being lonely and wanting to have more friends.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
You actually might have someone or even multiple people who want to hang out.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
But you might feel that this is not enough, that you're a loser and feel bad about yourself.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
So you might turn down their attempts to hang out and become more lonely.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
If you feel grateful for your relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of solidifying relationships and meeting new people.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
In the best case, gratitude can trigger a feedback loop.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Positive feelings lead to more prosocial behavior, which leads to more positive social experiences that cause more positive feelings.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
This is a common experience after serious hardship like chemotherapy, for example.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Life can feel amazing after a crisis is over.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
The smallest things can be bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun or chatting with a friend.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Objectively, your life is the same or maybe even slightly worse than before,

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
but your brain compares your present experiences with the times when life was bad and reacts with gratitude.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
So, in a nutshell, gratitude refocuses your attention towards the good things you have.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
And the consequences of this shift are better feelings and more positive experiences.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
While it is great to know these things, is there actually a way for you to feel more of it?

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
The ability to experience more or less gratitude is not equally distributed.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
You have what's known as trait gratitude that determines how much you are able to feel it.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
It depends on your genetics, personality, and culture.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
This discovery made scientists wonder if they could design exercises that change your trait gratitude and lead to more happiness.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's start with important caveats.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
It's not yet entirely clear to what degree gratitude can be trained or how long the effects last.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
There are no magic pills for happiness.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Life is complicated.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
On some days, it feels like you're in control of yourself, and on others, you feel like you're not.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And this is okay.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Also, sometimes pursuing happiness can make you more unhappy if you put too much pressure on yourself.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Gratitude should also not be seen as a solution to depression or a substitute for professional help.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It can only be a piece of the puzzle.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
It's not the solution to the puzzle itself.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
The easiest gratitude exercise, with the most solid research behind it, is gratitude journaling.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
It means sitting down for a few minutes, one to three times a week, and writing down five to ten things you're grateful for.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
It might feel weird at first, so start simply.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
Can you feel grateful for a little thing, like how great coffee is or that someone was kind to you?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Can you appreciate something someone else did for you?

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
Can you reflect on which things or people you would miss if they were gone and be grateful that they're in your life?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
We're all different, so you'll know what works for you.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
And that's it, really. It feels almost insulting. Like, things shouldn't be that simple.

07:53.000 --> 08:02.000
But in numerous studies, the participants reported more happiness and a higher general life satisfaction after doing this practice for a few weeks.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Even more, studies have found changes in brain activity some months after they ended.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Practicing gratitude may be a real way to reprogram yourself.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
This research shows that your emotions are not fixed.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
In the end, how you experience life is a representation of what you believe about it.

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
If you attack your core beliefs about yourself and your life, you can change your thoughts and feelings, which automatically changes your behavior.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
It's pretty mind-blowing that something as simple as self-reflection can hack the pathways in our brain to fight dissatisfaction.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
And if this is no reason to be more optimistic, what is?

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Being a human is hard, but it doesn't need to be as hard.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
And if you actively look, you might find that your life is much better than you thought.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
If you're curious and want to try out gratitude, we made a thing.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
Please note that you don't need to buy anything from anyone to practice gratitude. All you need is paper, a pen, and five minutes.

09:04.000 --> 09:15.000
Having said that, we've made a Kurzgesagt gratitude journal based on studies we've read, conversations with experts, and our personal experiences with gratitude over the last year.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
It's structured in a way that might make it a bit easier to get into the habit of gratitude journaling.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
There are short explanations and reflections to mix it up and make it more interesting.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
We've also made it as pretty as we could.

09:29.000 --> 09:38.000
This video continues the unofficial series of more personal, introspective videos from optimistic nihilism to loneliness and now gratitude.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
We don't want to be a self-help channel, so we'll keep this sort of video at roughly one per year.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
We hope they're helpful to some of you.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Thank you for watching.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You're welcome.
