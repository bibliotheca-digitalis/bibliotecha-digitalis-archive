0	4000	Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be.
4000	7000	That you're not successful enough.
7000	10000	Your relationship's not satisfying enough.
10000	13000	That you don't have the things you crave.
13000	17000	A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy,
17000	20000	and inwards with disappointment.
20000	24000	Pop culture, advertising, and social media make this worse
24000	28000	by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure,
28000	32000	you need to have great experiences constantly, be conventionally attractive,
32000	34000	have a lot of friends, and find your soulmate,
34000	38000	and that others have all of these things and are truly happy.
38000	41000	And, of course, a vast array of self-improvement products
41000	46000	implies that it's all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself.
46000	50000	In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to investigate
50000	53000	how we can counteract these impulses.
53000	55000	The field of positive psychology emerged,
55000	57000	the study of what makes life worth living,
57000	62000	while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative feelings.
62000	64000	Scientists began to ask,
64000	67000	why are some people happier and more satisfied than others,
67000	71000	and are there ways to apply what they're doing right to the rest of us?
71000	74000	In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors
74000	77000	of how happy people are, how easily they make friends,
77000	80000	and how good they are at dealing with hardship.
80000	84000	An antidote to dissatisfaction, so to speak.
84000	85000	Gratitude.
85000	88000	While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend
88000	90000	preached by people who use hashtags,
90000	95000	what we currently know about it is based on a body of scientific work and studies.
95000	97000	We'll include them in the description.
97000	102000	Gratitude can mean very different things to different people in different contexts.
102000	107000	It's a character trait, a feeling, a virtue, and a behavior.
107000	111000	You can feel grateful towards someone who did something for you,
111000	115000	for random events like the weather, or even for nature, or fate,
115000	119000	and it's wired into our biology.
119000	122000	How gratitude connects us to each other.
122000	127000	The predecessor of gratitude is probably reciprocity.
127000	131000	It likely evolved as a biological signal that motivates animals to exchange things
131000	135000	for their mutual benefit, and can be found in the animal kingdom
135000	140000	among certain fish, birds, or mammals, but especially in primates.
140000	143000	When your brain recognizes that someone's done something nice for you,
143000	147000	it reacts with gratitude to motivate you to repay them.
147000	152000	This gratitude makes you care about others, and others care about you.
152000	156000	This was important because as human brains got better at reading emotions,
156000	160000	selfish individuals were identified and shunned.
160000	166000	It became an evolutionary advantage to play well with others and build lasting relationships.
166000	171000	For example, if you were hungry and someone else showed you where to find tasty berries,
171000	175000	you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return the favor in the future,
175000	178000	a drive to be pro-social.
178000	182000	When you repaid them, they felt gratitude towards you.
182000	187000	This brought your ancestors closer together and forged bonds and friendships.
187000	192000	So early forms of gratitude were biological mechanisms that modified your behavior
192000	196000	towards cooperation, which helped humans to dominate Earth.
196000	201000	But over time, gratitude became more than just an impulse to play fair.
205000	209000	Scientists found that gratitude stimulates the pathways in your brain
209000	216000	involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting others' intentions.
216000	220000	It also makes it easier to save and retrieve positive memories.
220000	225000	Even more, gratitude directly counteracts negative feelings and traits
225000	231000	like envy and social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism.
231000	238000	As a consequence, people who are grateful no matter what for tend to be happier and more satisfied.
238000	242000	They have better relationships and easier time making friends.
242000	247000	They sleep better, tend to suffer less from depression, addiction, and burnout,
247000	251000	and are better at dealing with traumatic events.
251000	258000	In a way, gratitude makes it less likely that you'll fall into one of the psychological traps modern life has set for you.
258000	264000	For example, gratitude measurably counters the tendency to forget and downplay positive events.
264000	269000	If you work long and hard for something, actually getting it can feel daft and empty.
269000	275000	You can find yourself emotionally back where you started and try to achieve the next biggest thing,
275000	279000	looking for that satisfaction instead of being satisfied with yourself.
279000	283000	Or imagine being lonely and wanting to have more friends.
283000	287000	You actually might have someone or even multiple people who want to hang out.
287000	292000	But you might feel that this is not enough, that you're a loser and feel bad about yourself.
292000	296000	So you might turn down their attempts to hang out and become more lonely.
296000	302000	If you feel grateful for your relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative.
302000	308000	The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of solidifying relationships and meeting new people.
308000	312000	In the best case, gratitude can trigger a feedback loop.
312000	320000	Positive feelings lead to more prosocial behavior, which leads to more positive social experiences that cause more positive feelings.
320000	325000	This is a common experience after serious hardship like chemotherapy, for example.
325000	328000	Life can feel amazing after a crisis is over.
328000	336000	The smallest things can be bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun or chatting with a friend.
336000	341000	Objectively, your life is the same or maybe even slightly worse than before,
341000	348000	but your brain compares your present experiences with the times when life was bad and reacts with gratitude.
348000	354000	So, in a nutshell, gratitude refocuses your attention towards the good things you have.
354000	360000	And the consequences of this shift are better feelings and more positive experiences.
360000	366000	While it is great to know these things, is there actually a way for you to feel more of it?
370000	376000	The ability to experience more or less gratitude is not equally distributed.
376000	382000	You have what's known as trait gratitude that determines how much you are able to feel it.
382000	386000	It depends on your genetics, personality, and culture.
386000	394000	This discovery made scientists wonder if they could design exercises that change your trait gratitude and lead to more happiness.
394000	397000	Let's start with important caveats.
397000	402000	It's not yet entirely clear to what degree gratitude can be trained or how long the effects last.
402000	404000	There are no magic pills for happiness.
404000	406000	Life is complicated.
406000	412000	On some days, it feels like you're in control of yourself, and on others, you feel like you're not.
412000	414000	And this is okay.
414000	420000	Also, sometimes pursuing happiness can make you more unhappy if you put too much pressure on yourself.
420000	426000	Gratitude should also not be seen as a solution to depression or a substitute for professional help.
426000	428000	It can only be a piece of the puzzle.
428000	432000	It's not the solution to the puzzle itself.
432000	438000	The easiest gratitude exercise, with the most solid research behind it, is gratitude journaling.
438000	444000	It means sitting down for a few minutes, one to three times a week, and writing down five to ten things you're grateful for.
444000	448000	It might feel weird at first, so start simply.
448000	454000	Can you feel grateful for a little thing, like how great coffee is or that someone was kind to you?
454000	458000	Can you appreciate something someone else did for you?
458000	464000	Can you reflect on which things or people you would miss if they were gone and be grateful that they're in your life?
464000	468000	We're all different, so you'll know what works for you.
468000	473000	And that's it, really. It feels almost insulting. Like, things shouldn't be that simple.
473000	482000	But in numerous studies, the participants reported more happiness and a higher general life satisfaction after doing this practice for a few weeks.
482000	487000	Even more, studies have found changes in brain activity some months after they ended.
487000	492000	Practicing gratitude may be a real way to reprogram yourself.
492000	496000	This research shows that your emotions are not fixed.
496000	501000	In the end, how you experience life is a representation of what you believe about it.
501000	509000	If you attack your core beliefs about yourself and your life, you can change your thoughts and feelings, which automatically changes your behavior.
509000	517000	It's pretty mind-blowing that something as simple as self-reflection can hack the pathways in our brain to fight dissatisfaction.
517000	521000	And if this is no reason to be more optimistic, what is?
521000	525000	Being a human is hard, but it doesn't need to be as hard.
525000	531000	And if you actively look, you might find that your life is much better than you thought.
533000	537000	If you're curious and want to try out gratitude, we made a thing.
537000	544000	Please note that you don't need to buy anything from anyone to practice gratitude. All you need is paper, a pen, and five minutes.
544000	555000	Having said that, we've made a Kurzgesagt gratitude journal based on studies we've read, conversations with experts, and our personal experiences with gratitude over the last year.
555000	561000	It's structured in a way that might make it a bit easier to get into the habit of gratitude journaling.
561000	566000	There are short explanations and reflections to mix it up and make it more interesting.
566000	569000	We've also made it as pretty as we could.
569000	578000	This video continues the unofficial series of more personal, introspective videos from optimistic nihilism to loneliness and now gratitude.
578000	583000	We don't want to be a self-help channel, so we'll keep this sort of video at roughly one per year.
583000	586000	We hope they're helpful to some of you.
586000	588000	Thank you for watching.
596000	598000	You're welcome.
