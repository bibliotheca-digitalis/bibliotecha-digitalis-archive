1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Why is the ocean salty and rivers aren't?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,200
In fact, most of the salt in the sea comes from rivers.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,400
But how can that be?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,200
It all starts with ocean water heading out on a journey.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Warm surface water evaporates.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,800
The water vapor then rises to condense into clouds

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
that sometimes get carried over land where they rain down again.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,800
On their way down, the water droplets absorb CO2 and become slightly acidic.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
When they splash onto stones and soil,

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
they wash out salts and minerals as ions and feed them into rivers.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
From there, the salts travel to some lake or the ocean

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,600
where they can accumulate over time.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,400
After animals and plants feast on this mineral buffet,

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,800
sodium and chloride ions remain as leftovers.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
You know them as salt.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
It's responsible for the salinity of ocean water.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,400
Because the ocean deposits as much salt sediment on the seafloor as rivers feed into it,

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
the salt level stays at a stable 35 grams per liter on average.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Rivers, in turn, do not accumulate salt.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
They simply deliver the minerals and the little traces of salt to the oceans and lakes.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
What goes in, comes out.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Quack!
