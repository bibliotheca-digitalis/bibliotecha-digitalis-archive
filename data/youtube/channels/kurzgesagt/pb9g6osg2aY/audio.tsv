0	2400	Why is the ocean salty and rivers aren't?
2400	5200	In fact, most of the salt in the sea comes from rivers.
5200	6400	But how can that be?
6400	9200	It all starts with ocean water heading out on a journey.
9200	11200	Warm surface water evaporates.
11200	13800	The water vapor then rises to condense into clouds
13800	16600	that sometimes get carried over land where they rain down again.
16600	20800	On their way down, the water droplets absorb CO2 and become slightly acidic.
20800	22800	When they splash onto stones and soil,
22800	26400	they wash out salts and minerals as ions and feed them into rivers.
26400	28800	From there, the salts travel to some lake or the ocean
28800	30600	where they can accumulate over time.
30600	33400	After animals and plants feast on this mineral buffet,
33400	35800	sodium and chloride ions remain as leftovers.
35800	37200	You know them as salt.
37200	40200	It's responsible for the salinity of ocean water.
40200	44400	Because the ocean deposits as much salt sediment on the seafloor as rivers feed into it,
44400	48400	the salt level stays at a stable 35 grams per liter on average.
48400	50800	Rivers, in turn, do not accumulate salt.
50800	54800	They simply deliver the minerals and the little traces of salt to the oceans and lakes.
54800	57000	What goes in, comes out.
58800	59800	Quack!
