00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Why is the ocean salty and rivers aren't?

00:02.400 --> 00:05.200
In fact, most of the salt in the sea comes from rivers.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.400
But how can that be?

00:06.400 --> 00:09.200
It all starts with ocean water heading out on a journey.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.200
Warm surface water evaporates.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.800
The water vapor then rises to condense into clouds

00:13.800 --> 00:16.600
that sometimes get carried over land where they rain down again.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.800
On their way down, the water droplets absorb CO2 and become slightly acidic.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.800
When they splash onto stones and soil,

00:22.800 --> 00:26.400
they wash out salts and minerals as ions and feed them into rivers.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.800
From there, the salts travel to some lake or the ocean

00:28.800 --> 00:30.600
where they can accumulate over time.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.400
After animals and plants feast on this mineral buffet,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.800
sodium and chloride ions remain as leftovers.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.200
You know them as salt.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.200
It's responsible for the salinity of ocean water.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.400
Because the ocean deposits as much salt sediment on the seafloor as rivers feed into it,

00:44.400 --> 00:48.400
the salt level stays at a stable 35 grams per liter on average.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.800
Rivers, in turn, do not accumulate salt.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.800
They simply deliver the minerals and the little traces of salt to the oceans and lakes.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.000
What goes in, comes out.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.800
Quack!
