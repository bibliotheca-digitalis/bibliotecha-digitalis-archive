1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
What makes Ebola so dangerous?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,200
How can a virus overwhelm the very complex defense system of the body so quickly and so effectively?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,840
Let's take a look at what Ebola does.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,920
Ebola is a virus.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
A virus is a very small thing.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
A bit of RNA or DNA and a few proteins in a hull.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
It has no ability to do anything by itself whatsoever

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,400
and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,360
To avoid this, we have the immune system.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,080
The immune system is super complex,

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,040
so we developed a visual system that makes it easy to understand.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,600
So it looks like this.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
Let's concentrate on the part that's critical to understanding Ebola and ignore the rest.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,040
So, usually, dendritic cells would activate an army of antivirus cells,

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,360
support cells and antibody factories that would, together with the guard cells,

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,000
wipe out the infection in a matter of days.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
But when Ebola strikes, it directly attacks the immune system.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,160
Some of the first cells it takes over are the dendritic cells, the brains of the immune system.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,400
The Ebola virus enters a dendritic cell by binding onto receptors for cell transport.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
Once it's inside, it dissolves its outer hull

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,760
and releases its genetic material, nuclear proteins and enzymes.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880
In a nutshell, it takes over the cell,

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,800
disables the cell's protective mechanisms and reprograms it.

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,880
The cell now becomes a virus production machine and uses its resources to build Ebola viruses.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,360
Once the cell is saturated, it dissolves the cell membrane

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,400
and millions of viruses are released into the tissue.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,400
The virus not only prevents the dendritic cell from activating the specialized antivirus forces,

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,880
it manipulates it into sending signal proteins that trick the specialized cells

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
into ending their own lives prematurely.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
So the immune system is seriously disrupted and unable to react,

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,800
while the virus rapidly multiplies.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,080
We're talking billions.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
There are cells that should deal with infected cells, the natural killer cells.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
But they also get infected and just die before they can prevent the disease from spreading.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
At the same time, Ebola infects the guard cells of the body,

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,440
macrophages and monocytes, not only managing to circumvent their defenses,

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
it also manipulates them to signal to the cells that make up the blood vessels,

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
telling them to release fluids into the body.

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Usually this makes sense, but in this case, it just causes mayhem.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,520
All over the body, neutrophils are activated,

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,080
awoken by the virus and the macrophages signals.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
They're not very effective against viruses and should not be involved in this fight

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
and begin to do lots of stuff they shouldn't do.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
The neutrophils signal the blood vessels to release more fluid, causing internal bleeding.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Another area of the body Ebola attacks is the liver.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,040
The virus finds it very easy to enter the liver and it quickly starts killing loads of liver cells

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,320
and causing organ failure and more internal bleeding.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,280
And all of those things are going on at the same time.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,680
As the virus spreads, it's like nukes exploding everywhere.

50
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,280
One incident of this in one region would be problem enough,

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,920
but now it's starting to happen everywhere at once.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,000
All the mechanisms the immune system has evolved to handle infections work against you,

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,760
and the virus continues to spread and spread and finally begins to infect more and more body cells

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,240
while the body desperately struggles to stay alive.

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,520
In a desperate last effort to turn the tide, the immune system launches a cytokine storm.

56
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,600
A cytokine storm is an SOS signal that causes the immune system to launch all of its weapons

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,160
all at once in a desperate kamikaze attack.

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,320
This hurts the virus but leaves behind tons of collateral damage, especially in the blood vessels.

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,840
Paradoxically, the healthier the immune system, the more damage it can do to itself.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,120
More and more fluid leaves the bloodstream.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
Blood pours out of every opening of the body.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,680
You become seriously dehydrated.

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,400
There's just not enough blood left to supply the organs with oxygen and cells begin to die.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,480
If you reach this point, the chance of you dying is very high.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Currently, six out of ten infected die from Ebola.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,320
Wow, okay, Ebola is nasty.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,680
So it's time to panic, right?

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,760
No, not even close.

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
The severity of Ebola gets papers sold and YouTube videos shared,

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,880
so everybody is talking about Ebola.

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
But currently, the only way to get infected by Ebola is to come into contact with the

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
bodily fluids of a person who shows symptoms or from an infected bat.

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
So just don't do that.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Ebola has killed 5,000 people since June 2014.

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,120
The common flu kills up to 500,000 people each year.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Malaria kills up to 1 million each year.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,640
3,000 people every single day.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,720
Ten children since this video started.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
So even if Ebola is terrible and scary, don't let yourself be scared.

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
The most infectious thing about Ebola is the media hype around it.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,760
You could learn a bit more about the immune system, though.
