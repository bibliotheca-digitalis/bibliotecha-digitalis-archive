0	2720	What makes Ebola so dangerous?
2720	9200	How can a virus overwhelm the very complex defense system of the body so quickly and so effectively?
9200	11840	Let's take a look at what Ebola does.
18240	19920	Ebola is a virus.
19920	21920	A virus is a very small thing.
21920	25680	A bit of RNA or DNA and a few proteins in a hull.
25680	28800	It has no ability to do anything by itself whatsoever
28800	32400	and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells.
32960	35360	To avoid this, we have the immune system.
36000	38080	The immune system is super complex,
38080	41040	so we developed a visual system that makes it easy to understand.
41920	43600	So it looks like this.
43600	47760	Let's concentrate on the part that's critical to understanding Ebola and ignore the rest.
48320	53040	So, usually, dendritic cells would activate an army of antivirus cells,
53040	57360	support cells and antibody factories that would, together with the guard cells,
57360	60000	wipe out the infection in a matter of days.
60000	64080	But when Ebola strikes, it directly attacks the immune system.
64640	70160	Some of the first cells it takes over are the dendritic cells, the brains of the immune system.
71040	76400	The Ebola virus enters a dendritic cell by binding onto receptors for cell transport.
76400	79520	Once it's inside, it dissolves its outer hull
79520	83760	and releases its genetic material, nuclear proteins and enzymes.
84320	86880	In a nutshell, it takes over the cell,
86880	90800	disables the cell's protective mechanisms and reprograms it.
90800	96880	The cell now becomes a virus production machine and uses its resources to build Ebola viruses.
97520	101360	Once the cell is saturated, it dissolves the cell membrane
101360	104400	and millions of viruses are released into the tissue.
105040	110400	The virus not only prevents the dendritic cell from activating the specialized antivirus forces,
110400	114880	it manipulates it into sending signal proteins that trick the specialized cells
114880	117040	into ending their own lives prematurely.
117600	122240	So the immune system is seriously disrupted and unable to react,
122240	124800	while the virus rapidly multiplies.
124800	126080	We're talking billions.
126880	131280	There are cells that should deal with infected cells, the natural killer cells.
131280	135920	But they also get infected and just die before they can prevent the disease from spreading.
136640	140080	At the same time, Ebola infects the guard cells of the body,
140160	145440	macrophages and monocytes, not only managing to circumvent their defenses,
145440	149520	it also manipulates them to signal to the cells that make up the blood vessels,
149520	151440	telling them to release fluids into the body.
152080	156080	Usually this makes sense, but in this case, it just causes mayhem.
156720	159520	All over the body, neutrophils are activated,
159520	162080	awoken by the virus and the macrophages signals.
162640	166640	They're not very effective against viruses and should not be involved in this fight
166640	168800	and begin to do lots of stuff they shouldn't do.
169440	174000	The neutrophils signal the blood vessels to release more fluid, causing internal bleeding.
174800	177600	Another area of the body Ebola attacks is the liver.
178320	183040	The virus finds it very easy to enter the liver and it quickly starts killing loads of liver cells
183040	186320	and causing organ failure and more internal bleeding.
186320	189280	And all of those things are going on at the same time.
189920	193680	As the virus spreads, it's like nukes exploding everywhere.
194320	197280	One incident of this in one region would be problem enough,
197280	199920	but now it's starting to happen everywhere at once.
200720	206000	All the mechanisms the immune system has evolved to handle infections work against you,
206000	211760	and the virus continues to spread and spread and finally begins to infect more and more body cells
211760	214240	while the body desperately struggles to stay alive.
214960	219520	In a desperate last effort to turn the tide, the immune system launches a cytokine storm.
220400	225600	A cytokine storm is an SOS signal that causes the immune system to launch all of its weapons
225600	228160	all at once in a desperate kamikaze attack.
228800	234320	This hurts the virus but leaves behind tons of collateral damage, especially in the blood vessels.
235200	239840	Paradoxically, the healthier the immune system, the more damage it can do to itself.
240800	243120	More and more fluid leaves the bloodstream.
243120	245520	Blood pours out of every opening of the body.
245520	247680	You become seriously dehydrated.
247680	252400	There's just not enough blood left to supply the organs with oxygen and cells begin to die.
253040	256480	If you reach this point, the chance of you dying is very high.
257120	260320	Currently, six out of ten infected die from Ebola.
261200	264320	Wow, okay, Ebola is nasty.
264320	265680	So it's time to panic, right?
266400	267760	No, not even close.
268400	272400	The severity of Ebola gets papers sold and YouTube videos shared,
272400	274880	so everybody is talking about Ebola.
274880	279360	But currently, the only way to get infected by Ebola is to come into contact with the
279360	283600	bodily fluids of a person who shows symptoms or from an infected bat.
283600	285280	So just don't do that.
286000	289200	Ebola has killed 5,000 people since June 2014.
289760	293120	The common flu kills up to 500,000 people each year.
293840	296560	Malaria kills up to 1 million each year.
296560	298640	3,000 people every single day.
298640	300720	Ten children since this video started.
301440	306560	So even if Ebola is terrible and scary, don't let yourself be scared.
306560	310160	The most infectious thing about Ebola is the media hype around it.
310880	313760	You could learn a bit more about the immune system, though.
