00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
What makes Ebola so dangerous?

00:02.720 --> 00:09.200
How can a virus overwhelm the very complex defense system of the body so quickly and so effectively?

00:09.200 --> 00:11.840
Let's take a look at what Ebola does.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.920
Ebola is a virus.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.920
A virus is a very small thing.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.680
A bit of RNA or DNA and a few proteins in a hull.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.800
It has no ability to do anything by itself whatsoever

00:28.800 --> 00:32.400
and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.360
To avoid this, we have the immune system.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.080
The immune system is super complex,

00:38.080 --> 00:41.040
so we developed a visual system that makes it easy to understand.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.600
So it looks like this.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.760
Let's concentrate on the part that's critical to understanding Ebola and ignore the rest.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.040
So, usually, dendritic cells would activate an army of antivirus cells,

00:53.040 --> 00:57.360
support cells and antibody factories that would, together with the guard cells,

00:57.360 --> 01:00.000
wipe out the infection in a matter of days.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.080
But when Ebola strikes, it directly attacks the immune system.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.160
Some of the first cells it takes over are the dendritic cells, the brains of the immune system.

01:11.040 --> 01:16.400
The Ebola virus enters a dendritic cell by binding onto receptors for cell transport.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.520
Once it's inside, it dissolves its outer hull

01:19.520 --> 01:23.760
and releases its genetic material, nuclear proteins and enzymes.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.880
In a nutshell, it takes over the cell,

01:26.880 --> 01:30.800
disables the cell's protective mechanisms and reprograms it.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.880
The cell now becomes a virus production machine and uses its resources to build Ebola viruses.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.360
Once the cell is saturated, it dissolves the cell membrane

01:41.360 --> 01:44.400
and millions of viruses are released into the tissue.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.400
The virus not only prevents the dendritic cell from activating the specialized antivirus forces,

01:50.400 --> 01:54.880
it manipulates it into sending signal proteins that trick the specialized cells

01:54.880 --> 01:57.040
into ending their own lives prematurely.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.240
So the immune system is seriously disrupted and unable to react,

02:02.240 --> 02:04.800
while the virus rapidly multiplies.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.080
We're talking billions.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.280
There are cells that should deal with infected cells, the natural killer cells.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.920
But they also get infected and just die before they can prevent the disease from spreading.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.080
At the same time, Ebola infects the guard cells of the body,

02:20.160 --> 02:25.440
macrophages and monocytes, not only managing to circumvent their defenses,

02:25.440 --> 02:29.520
it also manipulates them to signal to the cells that make up the blood vessels,

02:29.520 --> 02:31.440
telling them to release fluids into the body.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.080
Usually this makes sense, but in this case, it just causes mayhem.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.520
All over the body, neutrophils are activated,

02:39.520 --> 02:42.080
awoken by the virus and the macrophages signals.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.640
They're not very effective against viruses and should not be involved in this fight

02:46.640 --> 02:48.800
and begin to do lots of stuff they shouldn't do.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.000
The neutrophils signal the blood vessels to release more fluid, causing internal bleeding.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.600
Another area of the body Ebola attacks is the liver.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.040
The virus finds it very easy to enter the liver and it quickly starts killing loads of liver cells

03:03.040 --> 03:06.320
and causing organ failure and more internal bleeding.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.280
And all of those things are going on at the same time.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.680
As the virus spreads, it's like nukes exploding everywhere.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.280
One incident of this in one region would be problem enough,

03:17.280 --> 03:19.920
but now it's starting to happen everywhere at once.

03:20.720 --> 03:26.000
All the mechanisms the immune system has evolved to handle infections work against you,

03:26.000 --> 03:31.760
and the virus continues to spread and spread and finally begins to infect more and more body cells

03:31.760 --> 03:34.240
while the body desperately struggles to stay alive.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.520
In a desperate last effort to turn the tide, the immune system launches a cytokine storm.

03:40.400 --> 03:45.600
A cytokine storm is an SOS signal that causes the immune system to launch all of its weapons

03:45.600 --> 03:48.160
all at once in a desperate kamikaze attack.

03:48.800 --> 03:54.320
This hurts the virus but leaves behind tons of collateral damage, especially in the blood vessels.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.840
Paradoxically, the healthier the immune system, the more damage it can do to itself.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.120
More and more fluid leaves the bloodstream.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.520
Blood pours out of every opening of the body.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.680
You become seriously dehydrated.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.400
There's just not enough blood left to supply the organs with oxygen and cells begin to die.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.480
If you reach this point, the chance of you dying is very high.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.320
Currently, six out of ten infected die from Ebola.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.320
Wow, okay, Ebola is nasty.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.680
So it's time to panic, right?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.760
No, not even close.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.400
The severity of Ebola gets papers sold and YouTube videos shared,

04:32.400 --> 04:34.880
so everybody is talking about Ebola.

04:34.880 --> 04:39.360
But currently, the only way to get infected by Ebola is to come into contact with the

04:39.360 --> 04:43.600
bodily fluids of a person who shows symptoms or from an infected bat.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.280
So just don't do that.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.200
Ebola has killed 5,000 people since June 2014.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.120
The common flu kills up to 500,000 people each year.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.560
Malaria kills up to 1 million each year.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.640
3,000 people every single day.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.720
Ten children since this video started.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.560
So even if Ebola is terrible and scary, don't let yourself be scared.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.160
The most infectious thing about Ebola is the media hype around it.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.760
You could learn a bit more about the immune system, though.
