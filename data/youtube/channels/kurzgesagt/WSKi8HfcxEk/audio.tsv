0	5880	How long do you think it will take before machines do your job better than you do?
5880	12280	Automation used to mean big, stupid machines doing repetitive work in factories. Today,
12280	18720	they can land aircraft, diagnose cancer, and trade stocks. We are entering a new age of automation,
18720	25080	unlike anything that's come before. According to a 2013 study, almost half of all jobs in the US
25120	28960	could potentially be automated in the next two decades. But wait,
28960	33040	hasn't automation been around for decades? What's different this time?
33040	52120	Things used to be simple. Innovation made human work easier and productivity rose,
52160	57040	which means that more staff or services could be produced per hour using the same amount of
57040	62640	human workers. This eliminated many jobs, but also created other jobs that were better,
62640	67680	which was important because the growing population needed work. So in a nutshell,
67680	74280	innovation, higher productivity, fewer old jobs, and many new and often better jobs.
74280	79720	Overall, this worked well for a majority of people and living standards improved.
79720	85520	There's a clear progression in terms of what humans did for a living. For the longest time,
85520	90640	we worked in agriculture. With the Industrial Revolution, this shifted to production jobs.
90640	97520	And as automation became more widespread, humans shifted into service jobs. And then,
97520	102320	only a few moments ago in human history, the Information Age happened. Suddenly,
102320	107480	the rules were different. Our jobs are now being taken over by machines much faster
107480	112840	than they were in the past. That's worrying, of course, but innovation will clearly save us,
112840	119320	right? While new Information Age industries are booming, they are creating fewer and fewer new
119320	126920	jobs. In 1979, General Motors employed more than 800,000 workers and made about 11 billion US
126920	135480	dollars. In 2012, Google made about 14 billion US dollars while employing 58,000 people. You
135480	139840	may not like this comparison, but Google is an example of what created new jobs in the past.
139840	146200	Innovative new industries. Old innovative industries are running out of steam. Just
146200	153600	look at cars. When they became a thing 100 years ago, they created huge industries. Cars transformed
153600	159160	our way of life, our infrastructure, and our cities. Millions of people found jobs either
159200	165880	directly or indirectly. Decades of investment kept this momentum going. Today, this process
165880	170920	is largely complete. Innovation in the car industry does not create as many jobs as it
170920	178120	used to. While electric cars are great and all, they won't create millions of new jobs. But wait,
178120	183400	what about the Internet? Some technologists argue that the Internet is an innovation on a
183400	189320	par with the introduction of electricity. If we go with this comparison, we see how our modern
189320	194880	innovation differs from the old one. The Internet created new industries, but they're not creating
194880	199560	enough jobs to keep up with population growth or to compensate for the industries the Internet
199560	207000	is killing. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and made 6 billion US dollars in
207000	215480	revenue. In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and made 9 billion dollars in revenue. Or take us,
215480	221300	for example. With a full-time team of just 12 people, Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people.
221300	227120	A TV station with the same amount of viewers needs way more employees. Innovation in the
227120	232080	information age doesn't equate to the creation of enough new jobs, which would be bad enough on its
232120	238360	own, but now a new wave of automation and a new generation of machines is slowly taking over.
238360	249240	To understand this, we need to understand ourselves first. Human progress is based on
249240	254280	the division of labor. As we advanced over thousands of years, our jobs became more and
254280	260000	more specialized. While even our smartest machines are bad at doing complicated jobs,
260000	266200	they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks. This is what
266200	271800	destroyed factory jobs. But look at a complex job long and hard enough and you'll find that
271800	277920	it's really just many narrowly defined and predictable tasks one after another. Machines
277920	283000	are on the brink of becoming so good at breaking down complex jobs into many predictable ones that
283000	288360	for a lot of people there will be no further room to specialize. We are on the verge of being
288400	294880	out-competed. Digital machines do this via machine learning, which enables them to acquire
294880	300440	information and skills by analyzing data. This makes them become better at something through
300440	306280	the relationships they discover. Machines teach themselves. We make this possible by giving a
306280	311600	computer a lot of data about the thing we wanted to become better at. Show a machine all the things
311600	317000	you bought online and it will slowly learn what to recommend to you so you buy more things.
317000	322840	Machine learning is now meeting more of its potential because in recent years humans have
322840	329840	started to gather data about everything. Behavior, weather patterns, medical records,
329840	337600	communication systems, travel data, and of course data about what we do at work. What we've created
337600	343720	by accident is a huge library machines can use to learn how humans do things and learn to do
343760	349680	them better. These digital machines might be the biggest job killer of all. They can be replicated
349680	356160	instantly and for free. When they improve you don't need to invest in big metal things you can
356160	364360	just use the new code and they have the ability to get better fast. How fast? If your work involves
364360	369560	complex work on a computer today you might be out of work even sooner than the people who still have
369560	375520	jobs in factories. There are actual real-world examples of how this transition might be
375520	380920	happening. A San Francisco company offers a project management software for big corporations
380920	387000	which is supposed to eliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project the
387000	392880	software first decides which jobs can be automated and precisely where it needs actual professional
392880	399440	humans. It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the internet. The software then distributes
399480	404720	tasks to the humans and controls the quality of the work tracking individual performance until the
404720	411160	project is complete. Okay this doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job it
411160	418160	creates jobs for freelancers right? Well as the freelancers complete their tasks learning algorithms
418160	423880	track them and gather data about their work and which tasks it consists of. So what's actually
424080	429480	happening is that the freelancers are teaching a machine how to replace them. On average this
429480	436560	software reduces costs by about 50% in the first year and by another 25% in the second year. This
436560	443360	is only one example of many. There are machines and programs getting as good or better than humans
443360	449800	in all kinds of fields. From pharmacists to analysts, journalists to radiologists, cashiers,
450040	455480	bank tellers or the unskilled worker flipping burgers. All of these jobs won't disappear
455480	461560	overnight but fewer and fewer humans will be doing them. We'll discuss a few cases in a
461560	472960	follow-up video but while jobs disappearing is bad it's only half of the story. It's not enough
472960	478600	to substitute old jobs with new ones. We need to be generating new jobs constantly because the world
478640	485280	population is growing. In the past we have solved this through innovation but since 1973 the
485280	490960	generation of new jobs in the US has begun to shrink and the first decade of the 21st century
490960	497560	was the first one where the total amount of jobs in the US did not grow for the first time. In a
497560	503560	country that needs to create up to 150,000 new jobs per month just to keep up with population
503560	511160	growth this is bad news. This is also starting to affect standards of living. In the past it was
511160	516920	seen as obvious that with rising productivity more and better jobs would be created but the
516920	525600	numbers tell a different story. In 1998 US workers worked a total of 194 billion hours. Over the
525600	533400	course of the next 15 years their output increased by 42% but in 2013 the amount of hours worked by
533720	541120	workers was still 194 billion hours. What this means is that despite productivity growing
541120	547000	drastically thousands of new businesses opening up and the US population growing by over 40 million
547000	554240	there was no growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years. At the same time wages for new
554240	560160	university graduates in the US have been declining for the past decade while up to 40% of new
560200	571760	graduates are forced to take on jobs that don't require a degree. Productivity is separating from
571760	577120	human labor. The nature of innovation in the information age is different from everything we
577120	584640	encountered before. This process started years ago and is already well underway even without new
584640	590520	disruptions like self-driving cars or robot accountants. It looks like automation is
590520	597440	different this time. This time the machines might really take our jobs. Our economies are based on
597440	602680	the premise that people consume but if fewer and fewer people have decent work who will be doing
602680	608520	all the consuming? Are we producing ever more cheaply only to arrive at a point where too few
608520	615240	people can actually buy all our stuff and services? Or will the future see a tiny minority of the
615240	620640	super-rich who own the machines dominating the rest of us? And does our future really have to
620640	626200	be that grim? While we were fairly dark in this video it's far from certain that things will turn
626200	631840	out negatively. The information age and modern automation could be a huge opportunity to change
631840	638360	human society and reduce poverty and inequality drastically. It could be a seminal moment in human
638360	643640	history. We'll talk about this potential and possible solutions like a universal basic income
643640	651320	in part two of this video series. We need to think big and fast because one thing's for sure the
651320	659800	machines are not coming they are already here. This video took us about 900 hours to make and
659800	664080	we've been working on it for over nine months. Projects like this one would not be possible
664080	669000	without your support on patreon.com. If you want to help us out and get a personal Kurzgesagt bird
669000	674560	in return that would be really useful. We based much of this video on two very good books the
674560	679400	rise of the robots and the second machine age. You can find links to both of them in the video
679400	685040	description highly recommend it. Also we made a little robot poster you can buy it and a lot of
685040	691360	other stuff in our DFTBA shop. This video is part of a larger series about how technology is already
691560	696240	changing and will change human life forever. If you want to continue watching we have a few
696240	696760	playlists.
