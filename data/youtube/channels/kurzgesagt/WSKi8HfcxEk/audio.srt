1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
How long do you think it will take before machines do your job better than you do?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,280
Automation used to mean big, stupid machines doing repetitive work in factories. Today,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,720
they can land aircraft, diagnose cancer, and trade stocks. We are entering a new age of automation,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,080
unlike anything that's come before. According to a 2013 study, almost half of all jobs in the US

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,960
could potentially be automated in the next two decades. But wait,

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
hasn't automation been around for decades? What's different this time?

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:52,120
Things used to be simple. Innovation made human work easier and productivity rose,

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,040
which means that more staff or services could be produced per hour using the same amount of

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,640
human workers. This eliminated many jobs, but also created other jobs that were better,

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
which was important because the growing population needed work. So in a nutshell,

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,280
innovation, higher productivity, fewer old jobs, and many new and often better jobs.

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,720
Overall, this worked well for a majority of people and living standards improved.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,520
There's a clear progression in terms of what humans did for a living. For the longest time,

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
we worked in agriculture. With the Industrial Revolution, this shifted to production jobs.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,520
And as automation became more widespread, humans shifted into service jobs. And then,

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,320
only a few moments ago in human history, the Information Age happened. Suddenly,

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,480
the rules were different. Our jobs are now being taken over by machines much faster

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,840
than they were in the past. That's worrying, of course, but innovation will clearly save us,

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,320
right? While new Information Age industries are booming, they are creating fewer and fewer new

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,920
jobs. In 1979, General Motors employed more than 800,000 workers and made about 11 billion US

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:15,480
dollars. In 2012, Google made about 14 billion US dollars while employing 58,000 people. You

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,840
may not like this comparison, but Google is an example of what created new jobs in the past.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,200
Innovative new industries. Old innovative industries are running out of steam. Just

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,600
look at cars. When they became a thing 100 years ago, they created huge industries. Cars transformed

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,160
our way of life, our infrastructure, and our cities. Millions of people found jobs either

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,880
directly or indirectly. Decades of investment kept this momentum going. Today, this process

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,920
is largely complete. Innovation in the car industry does not create as many jobs as it

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,120
used to. While electric cars are great and all, they won't create millions of new jobs. But wait,

29
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,400
what about the Internet? Some technologists argue that the Internet is an innovation on a

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,320
par with the introduction of electricity. If we go with this comparison, we see how our modern

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,880
innovation differs from the old one. The Internet created new industries, but they're not creating

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,560
enough jobs to keep up with population growth or to compensate for the industries the Internet

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,000
is killing. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and made 6 billion US dollars in

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,480
revenue. In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and made 9 billion dollars in revenue. Or take us,

35
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,300
for example. With a full-time team of just 12 people, Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people.

36
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,120
A TV station with the same amount of viewers needs way more employees. Innovation in the

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
information age doesn't equate to the creation of enough new jobs, which would be bad enough on its

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,360
own, but now a new wave of automation and a new generation of machines is slowly taking over.

39
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:09,240
To understand this, we need to understand ourselves first. Human progress is based on

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,280
the division of labor. As we advanced over thousands of years, our jobs became more and

41
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,000
more specialized. While even our smartest machines are bad at doing complicated jobs,

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,200
they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks. This is what

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,800
destroyed factory jobs. But look at a complex job long and hard enough and you'll find that

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,920
it's really just many narrowly defined and predictable tasks one after another. Machines

45
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,000
are on the brink of becoming so good at breaking down complex jobs into many predictable ones that

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,360
for a lot of people there will be no further room to specialize. We are on the verge of being

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,880
out-competed. Digital machines do this via machine learning, which enables them to acquire

48
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,440
information and skills by analyzing data. This makes them become better at something through

49
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,280
the relationships they discover. Machines teach themselves. We make this possible by giving a

50
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,600
computer a lot of data about the thing we wanted to become better at. Show a machine all the things

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,000
you bought online and it will slowly learn what to recommend to you so you buy more things.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,840
Machine learning is now meeting more of its potential because in recent years humans have

53
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,840
started to gather data about everything. Behavior, weather patterns, medical records,

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,600
communication systems, travel data, and of course data about what we do at work. What we've created

55
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,720
by accident is a huge library machines can use to learn how humans do things and learn to do

56
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,680
them better. These digital machines might be the biggest job killer of all. They can be replicated

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,160
instantly and for free. When they improve you don't need to invest in big metal things you can

58
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,360
just use the new code and they have the ability to get better fast. How fast? If your work involves

59
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,560
complex work on a computer today you might be out of work even sooner than the people who still have

60
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,520
jobs in factories. There are actual real-world examples of how this transition might be

61
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,920
happening. A San Francisco company offers a project management software for big corporations

62
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,000
which is supposed to eliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project the

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,880
software first decides which jobs can be automated and precisely where it needs actual professional

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,440
humans. It then helps assemble a team of freelancers over the internet. The software then distributes

65
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,720
tasks to the humans and controls the quality of the work tracking individual performance until the

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,160
project is complete. Okay this doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job it

67
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,160
creates jobs for freelancers right? Well as the freelancers complete their tasks learning algorithms

68
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,880
track them and gather data about their work and which tasks it consists of. So what's actually

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,480
happening is that the freelancers are teaching a machine how to replace them. On average this

70
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,560
software reduces costs by about 50% in the first year and by another 25% in the second year. This

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,360
is only one example of many. There are machines and programs getting as good or better than humans

72
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,800
in all kinds of fields. From pharmacists to analysts, journalists to radiologists, cashiers,

73
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,480
bank tellers or the unskilled worker flipping burgers. All of these jobs won't disappear

74
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,560
overnight but fewer and fewer humans will be doing them. We'll discuss a few cases in a

75
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:52,960
follow-up video but while jobs disappearing is bad it's only half of the story. It's not enough

76
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,600
to substitute old jobs with new ones. We need to be generating new jobs constantly because the world

77
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,280
population is growing. In the past we have solved this through innovation but since 1973 the

78
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,960
generation of new jobs in the US has begun to shrink and the first decade of the 21st century

79
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,560
was the first one where the total amount of jobs in the US did not grow for the first time. In a

80
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,560
country that needs to create up to 150,000 new jobs per month just to keep up with population

81
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,160
growth this is bad news. This is also starting to affect standards of living. In the past it was

82
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,920
seen as obvious that with rising productivity more and better jobs would be created but the

83
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:45,600
numbers tell a different story. In 1998 US workers worked a total of 194 billion hours. Over the

84
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,400
course of the next 15 years their output increased by 42% but in 2013 the amount of hours worked by

85
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:01,120
workers was still 194 billion hours. What this means is that despite productivity growing

86
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,000
drastically thousands of new businesses opening up and the US population growing by over 40 million

87
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,240
there was no growth at all in the number of hours worked in 15 years. At the same time wages for new

88
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,160
university graduates in the US have been declining for the past decade while up to 40% of new

89
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:31,760
graduates are forced to take on jobs that don't require a degree. Productivity is separating from

90
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,120
human labor. The nature of innovation in the information age is different from everything we

91
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,640
encountered before. This process started years ago and is already well underway even without new

92
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,520
disruptions like self-driving cars or robot accountants. It looks like automation is

93
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,440
different this time. This time the machines might really take our jobs. Our economies are based on

94
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,680
the premise that people consume but if fewer and fewer people have decent work who will be doing

95
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,520
all the consuming? Are we producing ever more cheaply only to arrive at a point where too few

96
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,240
people can actually buy all our stuff and services? Or will the future see a tiny minority of the

97
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,640
super-rich who own the machines dominating the rest of us? And does our future really have to

98
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,200
be that grim? While we were fairly dark in this video it's far from certain that things will turn

99
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,840
out negatively. The information age and modern automation could be a huge opportunity to change

100
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,360
human society and reduce poverty and inequality drastically. It could be a seminal moment in human

101
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,640
history. We'll talk about this potential and possible solutions like a universal basic income

102
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,320
in part two of this video series. We need to think big and fast because one thing's for sure the

103
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:59,800
machines are not coming they are already here. This video took us about 900 hours to make and

104
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,080
we've been working on it for over nine months. Projects like this one would not be possible

105
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,000
without your support on patreon.com. If you want to help us out and get a personal Kurzgesagt bird

106
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,560
in return that would be really useful. We based much of this video on two very good books the

107
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,400
rise of the robots and the second machine age. You can find links to both of them in the video

108
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,040
description highly recommend it. Also we made a little robot poster you can buy it and a lot of

109
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,360
other stuff in our DFTBA shop. This video is part of a larger series about how technology is already

110
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,240
changing and will change human life forever. If you want to continue watching we have a few
