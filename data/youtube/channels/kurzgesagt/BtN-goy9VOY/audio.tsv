0	5240	In December 2019, the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading
5240	6840	through their communities.
6840	11680	In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days.
11680	16920	This virus is the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 that causes
16920	22000	the disease called COVID-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus.
22000	25720	What actually happens when it infects a human, and what should we all do?
30000	40140	A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not
40140	41840	even a living thing.
41840	45760	It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.
45760	50700	Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.
50700	54940	Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection, when people cough, or if you touch
54940	59520	someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose.
59520	64000	The virus starts its journey here and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into
64000	65420	the body.
65420	70280	Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen, or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic
70280	71600	effect.
71600	76080	Even just a few coronaviruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.
76080	79840	The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.
79840	86080	These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa, waiting to be infected.
86080	90660	Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victims' membranes to inject its genetic
90660	91840	material.
91840	96800	The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple,
96800	99080	copy and reassemble.
99080	103280	It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical
103280	107700	point and receives one final order, self-destruct.
107700	113840	The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles, ready to attack more cells.
113840	117440	The number of infected cells grows exponentially.
117440	122680	After about ten days, millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm
122680	124160	the lungs.
124160	129100	The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real
129100	132280	beast on you, your own immune system.
132280	136720	The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself
136720	139260	and needs tight regulation.
139260	144440	And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, corona infects some of them
144440	147040	and creates confusion.
147040	148720	Cells have neither ears nor eyes.
148720	153060	They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.
153060	157200	Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.
157200	161420	Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.
161420	166220	In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers
166220	170380	than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage.
170380	173540	Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.
173540	178900	First, neutrophiles, which are great at killing stuff, including ourselves.
178900	183660	As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends
183660	185400	as enemies.
185400	189940	The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T cells, which usually
189940	193620	order infected cells to commit controlled suicide.
193620	198700	Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too.
198700	202660	The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy
202660	204760	lung tissue they kill.
204760	209780	This might get so bad that it can cause permanent, irreversible damage that leads to lifelong
209780	211300	disabilities.
211300	215100	In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control.
215100	219820	It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones, and cleans
219820	221300	up the battlefield.
221300	222940	Recovery begins.
222940	228660	The majority of people infected by corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms.
228660	232140	But many cases become severe or even critical.
232140	235880	We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe
235880	239060	to say that there is a lot more than with the flu.
239060	243620	In more severe cases, millions of epithelial cells have died, and with them, the lung's
243620	246000	protective lining is gone.
246000	250660	That means that the alveoli, tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs, can be infected
250660	254380	by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem.
254380	259660	Patients get pneumonia, respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators
259660	261440	to survive.
261440	267140	The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons.
267140	271300	And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed.
271300	274100	They enter the blood and overrun the body.
274100	277320	If this happens, death is very likely.
277320	282720	The coronavirus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it is much more dangerous.
282720	287120	While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for
287120	292420	sure that it is much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.
292420	297320	There are two futures for a pandemic like corona, fast and slow.
297320	302640	Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak.
302640	306760	A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives.
306760	310640	A slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.
310640	315400	The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection
315400	319000	because there are no countermeasures in place to slow it down.
319000	320740	Why is this so bad?
320740	324800	In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time.
324800	329280	If the numbers get too large, healthcare systems become unable to handle it.
329280	333260	There aren't enough resources like medical staff or equipment like ventilators left to
333260	334840	help everybody.
334840	337020	People will die untreated.
337020	342200	And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves, the capacity of healthcare systems falls even
342200	343760	further.
343760	348120	If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live
348120	349720	and who doesn't.
349720	354300	The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario.
354300	359040	To avoid this, the world – that means all of us – needs to do what it can to turn
359040	361520	this into a slow pandemic.
361520	367240	A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses, especially in the early phase, so that everyone
367240	372680	who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.
372680	377840	Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour
377840	380480	to act like a social vaccine.
380480	382960	This simply means two things.
382960	386600	Not getting infected and not infecting others.
386600	391240	Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.
391240	394000	Soap is actually a powerful tool.
394000	398000	The coronavirus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat.
398000	402160	Soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.
402160	406740	It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses
406740	408360	are ripped away.
408360	413040	To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put
413040	415400	in your contacts next.
415400	420260	The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing
420260	421340	to do.
421340	424100	This means no hugging, no handshakes.
424100	429760	If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function.
429760	432880	From doctors to cashiers or police officers.
432880	434460	You depend on all of them.
434460	437860	They all depend on you to not get sick.
437860	441660	On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things from travel
441660	445200	restrictions or actual orders to stay at home.
445200	448680	Quarantines are not great to experience, and certainly not popular.
448680	453780	But they buy us, and especially the researchers working on medication and vaccination, crucial
453780	454780	time.
454780	459240	So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why and respect it.
459240	461600	None of this is fun.
461600	466120	But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay.
466120	470160	The question of how pandemics end depends on how they start.
470160	473820	If they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly.
473820	478380	If they start slow with a not-so-steep slope, they end okayish.
478380	482580	And in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands.
482580	486260	Literally and figuratively.
486260	490620	A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, especially
490620	494980	Our World in Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest
494980	497860	problems and how to make progress solving them.
