1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
In December 2019, the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,840
through their communities.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,680
In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,920
This virus is the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 that causes

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,000
the disease called COVID-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,720
What actually happens when it infects a human, and what should we all do?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,140
A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,840
even a living thing.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,700
Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,940
Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection, when people cough, or if you touch

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,520
someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
The virus starts its journey here and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,420
the body.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,280
Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen, or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,600
effect.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
Even just a few coronaviruses can cause quite a dramatic situation.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa, waiting to be infected.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,660
Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victims' membranes to inject its genetic

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,840
material.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,800
The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple,

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,080
copy and reassemble.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,280
It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,700
point and receives one final order, self-destruct.

26
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,840
The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles, ready to attack more cells.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,440
The number of infected cells grows exponentially.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,680
After about ten days, millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,160
the lungs.

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,100
The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,280
beast on you, your own immune system.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,720
The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,260
and needs tight regulation.

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,440
And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, corona infects some of them

35
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,040
and creates confusion.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Cells have neither ears nor eyes.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,060
They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines.

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,200
Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,420
Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder.

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,220
In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,380
than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage.

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,540
Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,900
First, neutrophiles, which are great at killing stuff, including ourselves.

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,660
As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,400
as enemies.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,940
The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T cells, which usually

47
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,620
order infected cells to commit controlled suicide.

48
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,700
Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too.

49
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,660
The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy

50
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,760
lung tissue they kill.

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,780
This might get so bad that it can cause permanent, irreversible damage that leads to lifelong

52
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,300
disabilities.

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,100
In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control.

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,820
It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones, and cleans

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,300
up the battlefield.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,940
Recovery begins.

57
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,660
The majority of people infected by corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms.

58
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,140
But many cases become severe or even critical.

59
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,880
We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,060
to say that there is a lot more than with the flu.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,620
In more severe cases, millions of epithelial cells have died, and with them, the lung's

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,000
protective lining is gone.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,660
That means that the alveoli, tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs, can be infected

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,380
by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem.

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,660
Patients get pneumonia, respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,440
to survive.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,140
The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons.

68
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,300
And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed.

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,100
They enter the blood and overrun the body.

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,320
If this happens, death is very likely.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,720
The coronavirus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it is much more dangerous.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,420
sure that it is much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu.

74
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,320
There are two futures for a pandemic like corona, fast and slow.

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,640
Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,760
A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives.

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,640
A slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books.

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,400
The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection

79
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,000
because there are no countermeasures in place to slow it down.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,740
Why is this so bad?

81
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,800
In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time.

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
If the numbers get too large, healthcare systems become unable to handle it.

83
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,260
There aren't enough resources like medical staff or equipment like ventilators left to

84
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,840
help everybody.

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,020
People will die untreated.

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,200
And as more healthcare workers get sick themselves, the capacity of healthcare systems falls even

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,760
further.

88
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,120
If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live

89
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,720
and who doesn't.

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,300
The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario.

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,040
To avoid this, the world – that means all of us – needs to do what it can to turn

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,520
this into a slow pandemic.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,240
A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses, especially in the early phase, so that everyone

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,680
who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals.

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,840
Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,480
to act like a social vaccine.

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,960
This simply means two things.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,600
Not getting infected and not infecting others.

99
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,240
Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands.

100
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,000
Soap is actually a powerful tool.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The coronavirus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you.

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,740
It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,360
are ripped away.

105
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,040
To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put

106
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,400
in your contacts next.

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,260
The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing

108
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,340
to do.

109
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,100
This means no hugging, no handshakes.

110
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,760
If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function.

111
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,880
From doctors to cashiers or police officers.

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,460
You depend on all of them.

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,860
They all depend on you to not get sick.

114
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,660
On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things from travel

115
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,200
restrictions or actual orders to stay at home.

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,680
Quarantines are not great to experience, and certainly not popular.

117
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,780
But they buy us, and especially the researchers working on medication and vaccination, crucial

118
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
time.

119
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,240
So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why and respect it.

120
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,600
None of this is fun.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,120
But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay.

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,160
The question of how pandemics end depends on how they start.

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,820
If they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly.

124
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:58,380
If they start slow with a not-so-steep slope, they end okayish.

125
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,580
And in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands.

126
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,260
Literally and figuratively.

127
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,620
A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, especially

128
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,980
Our World in Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest

129
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,860
problems and how to make progress solving them.

130
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Check out their site.

131
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,260
It also includes a constantly updated page on the corona pandemic.
