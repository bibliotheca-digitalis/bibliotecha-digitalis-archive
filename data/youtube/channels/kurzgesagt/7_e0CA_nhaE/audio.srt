1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Some groups just don't get along.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and it's been going on for over 100 million years.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The World War of the Ants.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, they count more than 16,000 different species,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
with over 10,000 trillion individuals.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
While a single ant is pretty useless,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
together, they are able to achieve stunning feats.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They construct complex colonies, care for livestock,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
or have complex symbiotic relationships.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And, of course, ants wage war.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
causing millions of casualties.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The army ant group consists of about 200 different species.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Army ants do not build nests.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 meters long,

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects,

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
like termites, wasps, and especially other ants.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable,

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them,

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but they are quickly overwhelmed.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There is no recovery from that.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now, you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually,

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other,

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away,

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Indeed, they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
carrying as many larvae with them as they can in order to return and rebuild after the attack.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They have worker classes that have big square heads.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so the attackers have to give up after a while.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But not everybody is afraid of army ants.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They live in extensive nests many meters deep and across,

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They still have a nemesis, though.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The diet of the army ant species, Nomomomix ezenbeckii,

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
consists mostly of the larvae of other ants.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack,

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers,

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
who very quickly swarm to the site of attack.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A front line develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The leafcutter soldiers go head to head with the army ants,

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
lock in on them and try to cut through their heads.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Smaller leafcutter workers help by grabbing the enemies.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Small teams carry out attacks behind the front line,

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The attackers, meanwhile, try to swarm their victims' soldiers and sting them to death in a mob.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Despite the powerful defense and the determined response,

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the army ants are still superior in numbers.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their brood.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders,

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time,

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutter's brood to eat them.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Even if the leafcutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When the army ants attack, death follows them.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Species that form super-colonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents,

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
engaging in wars kilometers across.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They deserve their own video, though.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence,

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
be it between huge colonies or small groups trying to fend off a raid.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
For ants, though, the other ant will always be the enemy.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No, some groups just don't get along.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
