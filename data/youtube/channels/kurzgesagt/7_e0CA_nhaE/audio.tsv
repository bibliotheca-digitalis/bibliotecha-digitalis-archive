0	4000	Some groups just don't get along.
4000	8000	Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts,
8000	12000	and it's been going on for over 100 million years.
12000	16000	The World War of the Ants.
16000	31000	Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago,
31000	35000	and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully
35000	39000	that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth.
39000	43000	Today, they count more than 16,000 different species,
43000	47000	with over 10,000 trillion individuals.
47000	53000	Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land.
53000	58000	Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration.
58000	61000	While a single ant is pretty useless,
61000	65000	together, they are able to achieve stunning feats.
65000	69000	They construct complex colonies, care for livestock,
70000	73000	or have complex symbiotic relationships.
73000	77000	And, of course, ants wage war.
77000	82000	Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common.
82000	86000	Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day,
86000	89000	causing millions of casualties.
89000	93000	Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos.
93000	99000	In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war.
99000	103000	The army ant group consists of about 200 different species.
103000	105000	Army ants do not build nests.
105000	110000	They live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals.
110000	114000	On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 meters long,
114000	120000	killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter.
120000	126000	The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day.
126000	131000	Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects,
131000	135000	like termites, wasps, and especially other ants.
135000	138000	Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable,
138000	143000	but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance.
143000	147000	The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them,
147000	149000	but they are quickly overwhelmed.
149000	155000	Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them.
155000	158000	There is no recovery from that.
158000	163000	When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack.
163000	167000	Now, you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not.
167000	173000	Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective.
173000	177000	Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually,
177000	183000	but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense.
183000	191000	And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated.
191000	195000	Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants.
195000	199000	When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other,
199000	203000	ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away,
203000	206000	which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint.
206000	212000	Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago.
212000	218000	Indeed, they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence.
218000	223000	Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts
223000	229000	carrying as many larvae with them as they can in order to return and rebuild after the attack.
229000	234000	Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile.
234000	237000	They have worker classes that have big square heads.
237000	242000	When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests,
242000	245000	so the attackers have to give up after a while.
245000	248000	But not everybody is afraid of army ants.
248000	254000	Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans.
254000	258000	They live in extensive nests many meters deep and across,
258000	263000	harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor.
263000	268000	Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker.
268000	273000	Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants.
273000	275000	They still have a nemesis, though.
275000	279000	The diet of the army ant species, Nomomomix ezenbeckii,
279000	282000	consists mostly of the larvae of other ants.
282000	287000	Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste.
287000	293000	So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters.
293000	299000	When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column.
299000	302000	The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack,
302000	305000	they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers,
305000	308000	who very quickly swarm to the site of attack.
308000	313000	A front line develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep.
314000	317000	The leafcutter soldiers go head to head with the army ants,
317000	320000	lock in on them and try to cut through their heads.
320000	323000	Smaller leafcutter workers help by grabbing the enemies.
323000	326000	Small teams carry out attacks behind the front line,
326000	330000	where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies.
330000	336000	The attackers, meanwhile, try to swarm their victims' soldiers and sting them to death in a mob.
336000	340000	Despite the powerful defense and the determined response,
340000	343000	the army ants are still superior in numbers.
343000	348000	So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst.
348000	356000	Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their brood.
356000	359000	If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders,
359000	362000	or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time,
362000	366000	the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition.
366000	373000	They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutter's brood to eat them.
373000	378000	Even if the leafcutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow.
378000	383000	Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield.
383000	387000	When the army ants attack, death follows them.
387000	391000	But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies.
391000	397000	Species that form super-colonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents,
397000	400000	engaging in wars kilometers across.
400000	403000	They deserve their own video, though.
403000	407000	No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence,
407000	412000	be it between huge colonies or small groups trying to fend off a raid.
412000	418000	In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day.
418000	423000	Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore.
423000	428000	For ants, though, the other ant will always be the enemy.
428000	432000	No, some groups just don't get along.
