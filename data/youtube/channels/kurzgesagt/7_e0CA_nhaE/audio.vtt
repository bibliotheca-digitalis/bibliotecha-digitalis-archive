00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Some groups just don't get along.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts,

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
and it's been going on for over 100 million years.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
The World War of the Ants.

00:16.000 --> 00:31.000
Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Today, they count more than 16,000 different species,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
with over 10,000 trillion individuals.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
While a single ant is pretty useless,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
together, they are able to achieve stunning feats.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
They construct complex colonies, care for livestock,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
or have complex symbiotic relationships.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And, of course, ants wage war.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
causing millions of casualties.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
The army ant group consists of about 200 different species.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Army ants do not build nests.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
They live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 meters long,

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
like termites, wasps, and especially other ants.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
but they are quickly overwhelmed.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
There is no recovery from that.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Now, you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Indeed, they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
carrying as many larvae with them as they can in order to return and rebuild after the attack.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
They have worker classes that have big square heads.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
so the attackers have to give up after a while.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But not everybody is afraid of army ants.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
They live in extensive nests many meters deep and across,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
They still have a nemesis, though.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
The diet of the army ant species, Nomomomix ezenbeckii,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
consists mostly of the larvae of other ants.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
who very quickly swarm to the site of attack.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
A front line develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
The leafcutter soldiers go head to head with the army ants,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
lock in on them and try to cut through their heads.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Smaller leafcutter workers help by grabbing the enemies.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Small teams carry out attacks behind the front line,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
The attackers, meanwhile, try to swarm their victims' soldiers and sting them to death in a mob.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Despite the powerful defense and the determined response,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
the army ants are still superior in numbers.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their brood.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutter's brood to eat them.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Even if the leafcutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
When the army ants attack, death follows them.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
Species that form super-colonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
engaging in wars kilometers across.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
They deserve their own video, though.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
be it between huge colonies or small groups trying to fend off a raid.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
For ants, though, the other ant will always be the enemy.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
No, some groups just don't get along.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
