0	4000	Do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change?
4000	11000	More and more voices from science, environmental activists and the press have been saying so in recent years.
11000	17000	But this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it.
17000	22000	So who's right? Well, it's complicated.
22000	28000	To slow rapid climate change, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero.
28000	35000	In 2018, three-quarters of global emissions were released through energy production, namely by burning fossil fuels.
35000	41000	Energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around,
41000	45000	to putting things big and small together, or heating our homes.
45000	50000	Currently, 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels.
50000	55000	33% from oil, 27% from coal and 24% from gas.
55000	62000	Around 10% of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm.
62000	67000	Only about 16% of global energy is from low emission sources,
67000	75000	almost 7% from hydroelectric, 5% from solar, wind, bioenergy, wave, tidal and geothermal combined,
75000	78000	and about 4% from nuclear.
79000	84000	So we pretty much rely on coal, oil and gas to keep our civilization going,
84000	88000	which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them.
88000	93000	To have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing humanity back into the Stone Age,
93000	99000	one of the most impactful things we can do is to electrify as many sectors as possible.
99000	106000	Electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch YouTube.
106000	115000	Every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to electric heaters.
115000	118000	Why do we need to bet so hard on electricity?
118000	125000	Because we can produce electricity with low emission technologies like solar, wind or nuclear.
125000	129000	So electricity is a real lever for a radical transition.
129000	134000	But there are a few problems making this transition really hard.
134000	141000	First of all, in most places in the world, electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels.
141000	149000	And not only that, in the last 20 years, the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms.
149000	154000	While we are installing renewables at record speeds, at the same time,
154000	159000	the amount of fossil fuel we're burning for electricity still keeps rising year by year.
159000	164000	Renewables have so far not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity,
164000	170000	and so despite our progress, emissions from electricity are still rising worldwide.
170000	173000	The other alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear.
173000	180000	And even though it's not renewable, its greenhouse gas emissions are tiny compared to burning stuff.
180000	184000	But in the last 20 years, nuclear has basically stagnated.
184000	188000	Countries like China, India and South Korea built new reactors,
188000	193000	while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline.
193000	199000	Which seems a bit weird if we look at the countries with the most low carbon electricity in the world
199000	204000	that get most of their juice mainly from two sources, nuclear or hydropower.
204000	206000	Take France and Sweden.
206000	210000	In France, only around 10% comes from fossil fuels,
210000	216000	while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from renewables, primarily hydro.
216000	222000	In Sweden, almost 30% comes from nuclear power and about 45% from hydro.
222000	226000	So we know that nuclear energy can work at scale.
226000	231000	On the technical side, because of the lack of investment and innovation in the last few decades,
231000	237000	the majority of the world's nuclear reactors are pretty old technology that's very costly to replace.
237000	242000	In most Western countries, building nuclear reactors has become very expensive
242000	246000	for a variety of reasons like a loss of know-how in constructing them,
246000	249000	policy changes and increased regulatory constraints,
249000	253000	so it can take a decade or longer just to finish a power plant.
253000	257000	In contrast, countries like South Korea, China, India and Russia
257000	262000	are able to build new nuclear reactors comparatively quickly and at a competitive cost.
262000	266000	Still, generally in the West, the current generation of nuclear power plants
266000	271000	are more expensive to build and maintain than most fossil fuel alternatives.
271000	275000	There are also the concerns about nuclear waste and the fear of accidents,
275000	278000	but we cover those in other videos in more detail.
278000	283000	We have designs for nuclear reactors that solve many of their problems,
283000	287000	namely small reactors that take less time and money to get started.
287000	293000	There are also next-generation technologies that can already turn radioactive waste into new fuel,
293000	300000	but so far these have not been deployed at a scale where they can have a significant impact on the nuclear sector.
300000	306000	Considering these uncertainties, some argue that nuclear power is a dangerous relic of the past
306000	310000	and that we should just let it go and focus on renewables.
310000	314000	But while renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity,
314000	317000	they still have their own huge challenges to overcome
317000	321000	before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity grid.
321000	325000	The main problem is reliability and consistency.
325000	328000	It's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine,
328000	333000	especially in the mornings and evenings when humans need the most electricity.
333000	338000	The variations between seasons don't make this issue easier.
338000	341000	To make renewables reliable and not risk blackouts,
341000	347000	we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their peak
347000	350000	and release it later when we actually need it.
350000	356000	Until this is possible, other sources of electricity need to provide a controllable load
356000	361000	that creates the reliability of supply that our civilization needs to run properly.
361000	368000	Eventually, we will be able to do this with renewables, but we need a lot of batteries or storage power plants.
369000	376000	Right now, we simply don't have the tech and the capacities to make this transition fast enough to replace fossil fuels.
376000	381000	But even if we could, there's another aspect we have to take into account.
381000	388000	We're not just trying to kick fossil fuels out of electricity, we're trying to replace energy with electricity.
388000	394000	If we're going to electrify sectors that currently use fossil fuels, like cars or heating,
394000	400000	we will need significantly more electricity than we're currently using everywhere around the world.
400000	408000	And if the electricity needs of the world population continue to grow as they have over the last 20 years, we'll need even more.
408000	414000	It all comes down to one thing. No energy source is perfect. All have their own unique problems.
414000	420000	Both renewables and nuclear energy require time, investment, and technological innovation.
420000	428000	On their own, neither is ready to remove fossil fuels from our electricity grid, although activists on both sides claim that they are.
428000	433000	In the end, the question is how we want to deal with all these challenges.
433000	439000	Should we give up nuclear immediately and at least temporarily accept higher emissions?
439000	448000	Will we try to extend the life of current nuclear reactors and shut them down afterwards while solving the shortcomings of renewables?
448000	455000	Or will we invest in new nuclear technology to get new nuclear reactor types that are cheaper and safer?
455000	458000	Or will we maybe do both?
458000	461000	Opinion part starts here.
461000	471000	Considering the risks that climate change poses for the biosphere and humanity, any technology that has a chance of contributing to a solution should be pursued.
471000	474000	That's just good risk management and strategy.
474000	483000	If preventing rapid climate change as quickly as possible is our goal, it might be a good idea to see nuclear and renewables not as opponents, but as partners.
483000	489000	We know there's no time to waste, so we should keep all of our low-emission players on the field.
489000	494000	As things are, both nuclear and renewables need innovation and investment.
494000	501000	But if we don't know yet which technology will be ready how quickly, why not just invest in both and see what happens?
501000	512000	And on the topic of current capacities, if we take nuclear energy offline right now, then that missing capacity will be replaced, at least partially, by fossil fuels.
512000	526000	Even if new nuclear power plants in the West are expensive, in the long run it may be cheaper to build them as long as they prevent more fossil fuel capacity being added and paying for the consequences of rapid climate change.
526000	529000	So, do we need nuclear energy?
529000	534000	Well, it really depends how hard we choose to make things for ourselves.
534000	541000	And in a world that's already having a really hard time quitting fossil fuels, why should we make things harder than necessary?
541000	547000	Starting the change process and trying something new is always difficult.
547000	550000	Luckily, you don't have to do it all on your own.
