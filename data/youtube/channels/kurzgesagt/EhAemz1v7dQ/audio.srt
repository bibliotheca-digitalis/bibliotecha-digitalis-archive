1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
More and more voices from science, environmental activists and the press have been saying so in recent years.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So who's right? Well, it's complicated.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
To slow rapid climate change, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In 2018, three-quarters of global emissions were released through energy production, namely by burning fossil fuels.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to putting things big and small together, or heating our homes.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Currently, 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
33% from oil, 27% from coal and 24% from gas.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Around 10% of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Only about 16% of global energy is from low emission sources,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
almost 7% from hydroelectric, 5% from solar, wind, bioenergy, wave, tidal and geothermal combined,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and about 4% from nuclear.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we pretty much rely on coal, oil and gas to keep our civilization going,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing humanity back into the Stone Age,

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
one of the most impactful things we can do is to electrify as many sectors as possible.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch YouTube.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to electric heaters.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why do we need to bet so hard on electricity?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because we can produce electricity with low emission technologies like solar, wind or nuclear.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So electricity is a real lever for a radical transition.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But there are a few problems making this transition really hard.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
First of all, in most places in the world, electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And not only that, in the last 20 years, the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
While we are installing renewables at record speeds, at the same time,

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the amount of fossil fuel we're burning for electricity still keeps rising year by year.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Renewables have so far not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity,

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and so despite our progress, emissions from electricity are still rising worldwide.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The other alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And even though it's not renewable, its greenhouse gas emissions are tiny compared to burning stuff.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But in the last 20 years, nuclear has basically stagnated.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Countries like China, India and South Korea built new reactors,

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Which seems a bit weird if we look at the countries with the most low carbon electricity in the world

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that get most of their juice mainly from two sources, nuclear or hydropower.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take France and Sweden.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In France, only around 10% comes from fossil fuels,

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from renewables, primarily hydro.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In Sweden, almost 30% comes from nuclear power and about 45% from hydro.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we know that nuclear energy can work at scale.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
On the technical side, because of the lack of investment and innovation in the last few decades,

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the majority of the world's nuclear reactors are pretty old technology that's very costly to replace.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In most Western countries, building nuclear reactors has become very expensive

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
for a variety of reasons like a loss of know-how in constructing them,

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
policy changes and increased regulatory constraints,

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so it can take a decade or longer just to finish a power plant.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In contrast, countries like South Korea, China, India and Russia

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
are able to build new nuclear reactors comparatively quickly and at a competitive cost.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Still, generally in the West, the current generation of nuclear power plants

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
are more expensive to build and maintain than most fossil fuel alternatives.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There are also the concerns about nuclear waste and the fear of accidents,

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but we cover those in other videos in more detail.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We have designs for nuclear reactors that solve many of their problems,

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
namely small reactors that take less time and money to get started.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are also next-generation technologies that can already turn radioactive waste into new fuel,

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but so far these have not been deployed at a scale where they can have a significant impact on the nuclear sector.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Considering these uncertainties, some argue that nuclear power is a dangerous relic of the past

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and that we should just let it go and focus on renewables.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But while renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity,

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
they still have their own huge challenges to overcome

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity grid.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The main problem is reliability and consistency.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine,

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
especially in the mornings and evenings when humans need the most electricity.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The variations between seasons don't make this issue easier.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To make renewables reliable and not risk blackouts,

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their peak

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and release it later when we actually need it.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Until this is possible, other sources of electricity need to provide a controllable load

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that creates the reliability of supply that our civilization needs to run properly.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Eventually, we will be able to do this with renewables, but we need a lot of batteries or storage power plants.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right now, we simply don't have the tech and the capacities to make this transition fast enough to replace fossil fuels.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But even if we could, there's another aspect we have to take into account.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We're not just trying to kick fossil fuels out of electricity, we're trying to replace energy with electricity.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If we're going to electrify sectors that currently use fossil fuels, like cars or heating,

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
we will need significantly more electricity than we're currently using everywhere around the world.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And if the electricity needs of the world population continue to grow as they have over the last 20 years, we'll need even more.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It all comes down to one thing. No energy source is perfect. All have their own unique problems.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Both renewables and nuclear energy require time, investment, and technological innovation.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
On their own, neither is ready to remove fossil fuels from our electricity grid, although activists on both sides claim that they are.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In the end, the question is how we want to deal with all these challenges.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Should we give up nuclear immediately and at least temporarily accept higher emissions?

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Will we try to extend the life of current nuclear reactors and shut them down afterwards while solving the shortcomings of renewables?

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or will we invest in new nuclear technology to get new nuclear reactor types that are cheaper and safer?

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or will we maybe do both?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Opinion part starts here.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Considering the risks that climate change poses for the biosphere and humanity, any technology that has a chance of contributing to a solution should be pursued.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's just good risk management and strategy.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If preventing rapid climate change as quickly as possible is our goal, it might be a good idea to see nuclear and renewables not as opponents, but as partners.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We know there's no time to waste, so we should keep all of our low-emission players on the field.

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
As things are, both nuclear and renewables need innovation and investment.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But if we don't know yet which technology will be ready how quickly, why not just invest in both and see what happens?

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And on the topic of current capacities, if we take nuclear energy offline right now, then that missing capacity will be replaced, at least partially, by fossil fuels.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Even if new nuclear power plants in the West are expensive, in the long run it may be cheaper to build them as long as they prevent more fossil fuel capacity being added and paying for the consequences of rapid climate change.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, do we need nuclear energy?

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, it really depends how hard we choose to make things for ourselves.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And in a world that's already having a really hard time quitting fossil fuels, why should we make things harder than necessary?

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Starting the change process and trying something new is always difficult.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Luckily, you don't have to do it all on your own.

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If you want to get out of a rut, we've got something for you.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We are big fans of Skillshare, an online learning community that offers thousands of classes for all skill levels in tons of creative disciplines like illustration, animation, or film and video.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or you could try a class on home decoration, growing house plants, or playing the guitar. There's something for everyone, really.

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Unlimited access to all the classes is less than $10 a month with an annual premium membership, and the first 1000 Kurzgesagt viewers to click the link in the description will get a free trial.

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Since we started working with Skillshare, you, our viewers, have taken over 100,000 hours of classes, including our own three Skillshare classes on how we make our animations.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you want to learn more about motion graphics, give them a try.

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And if you need an extra little push to get you going, maybe get started with some advice on motivation and inspiration.

109
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We liked the scientific method for artists. Find inspiration, get motivated, and grow your creative skills by Kendall Hillegas.

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
In this class, Kendall explains her four-phase process for exploring and figuring out your direction as an artist.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For us, it was a great way to get into the flow of creating something.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But anything that makes you feel excited and sparks new ideas is a great first step.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
