00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
In the 1970s, thousands of chicken heads rained from the sky in Europe,

00:04.640 --> 00:08.080
making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy.

00:08.880 --> 00:09.380
Why?

00:10.160 --> 00:14.160
They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.080
Since the 1930s, a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe,

00:20.080 --> 00:23.280
and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.640
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage,

00:28.640 --> 00:31.680
and has been haunting us for at least 4,000 years.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.440
It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.200
But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is,

00:43.200 --> 00:47.200
but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.

00:47.200 --> 00:59.520
Viruses exist on the edge between life and death,

00:59.520 --> 01:04.160
hardly more than a few genetic instructions that need living cells to multiply.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.440
The Lyssa virus is simple even for a virus.

01:07.440 --> 01:13.760
It has only 5 genes, that is, the instructions for 5 proteins that let it solve complex problems,

01:13.760 --> 01:17.440
infect a mammal, avoid its immune system, travel to its brain,

01:17.440 --> 01:20.320
make more of itself, and infect new hosts.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.440
Let's see what happens if you get infected.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.600
It all starts with a bite, most likely by a dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.280
pushing them deep into the tissue.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.720
The goal is your nerve cells, your neurons.

01:35.440 --> 01:39.840
They are living electrochemical wires transferring signals throughout your body

01:39.840 --> 01:42.320
and can stretch for up to one and a half meters,

01:42.320 --> 01:46.080
with their cellular machinery on one end and a terminal on the other.

01:46.880 --> 01:52.160
The terminal is where cells talk to each other, by passing chemicals that convey information.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.920
Lyssa probably binds to the receptors that are crucial for this process

01:55.920 --> 01:58.800
and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.400
Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.040
It needs to get to the cellular machinery to take over the cell and make more viruses,

02:07.040 --> 02:10.080
and because neurons are pretty long, this can be far away.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.720
There is a solution at hand, though.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.400
Cells have microtubules spanning their insides that give them structural integrity,

02:18.400 --> 02:22.320
but they also provide a track system for a specialized delivery system.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.440
Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy and deliver packages.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.160
They're made from 50 different proteins,

02:30.160 --> 02:33.440
10 times more than the virus and look like a little pair of shoes.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.480
Lyssa uses one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing system

02:38.480 --> 02:40.320
and order it to head for the nucleus.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.680
What's the immune system doing to prevent all of that?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.720
Well, unfortunately, not much.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.880
Usually, when a virus attacks,

02:48.880 --> 02:52.160
your civilian cells are crucial in activating your immune response.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.880
They notice that they've been infected

02:54.880 --> 02:58.400
and release hundreds of thousands of a special family of proteins,

02:58.400 --> 03:02.240
the interferons that, well, interfere with viruses.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.600
We'll have to simplify a lot,

03:03.600 --> 03:08.640
but in a nutshell, interferons alert your immune system to make antivirus weapons.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.840
But they do much more.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.920
They tell civilian cells to turn down their protein factories for a while,

03:13.920 --> 03:17.040
which means that viruses can't replicate efficiently anymore.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.960
And interferons tell your cells to become super transparent,

03:20.960 --> 03:23.520
which is important, because how can your immune cells

03:23.520 --> 03:27.440
notice that your civilian cells are infected when viruses hide inside them?

03:28.320 --> 03:32.160
Your body solves this by creating display windows into their insides,

03:32.240 --> 03:34.640
called MHC class 1 molecules.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.240
Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive,

03:38.240 --> 03:41.440
and to showcase to your immune cells what's going on inside them,

03:41.440 --> 03:43.600
they take random samples of their products

03:43.600 --> 03:46.800
and put them into these tiny display windows to give a peek inside.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.120
Interferons tell your cells to make way more display windows

03:51.120 --> 03:52.880
and become super transparent.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.720
If a cell is infected and forced to make virus parts,

03:56.720 --> 03:59.280
your immune cells will see these parts in a window

03:59.280 --> 04:01.760
and order the infected cell to kill itself,

04:01.760 --> 04:03.440
and all the viruses trapped within.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.080
This is one of the most powerful methods of wiping out a viral infection.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.880
Unfortunately, Mlyssa blocks your neurons from making interferons

04:12.880 --> 04:15.600
and stays basically invisible to your immune system.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.440
In contrast to many other viruses, when it replicates,

04:19.440 --> 04:23.120
it doesn't kill its host, which would also trigger alarm systems.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.760
Instead, it stealthily jumps from neuron to neuron,

04:27.760 --> 04:30.080
very slowly making its way to your brain.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.720
This phase can take weeks to months, and very rarely even years,

04:34.720 --> 04:38.560
and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite was in your face or foot,

04:38.560 --> 04:40.640
or how many viruses got into your muscles.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.440
Lissa is a patient monster.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.000
Until it reaches its goal, you'll brainstem.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.120
Finally, the immune system catches on that something isn't right and reacts.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.680
It dispatches some of your most powerful antivirus cells, killer T cells,

04:55.680 --> 04:58.640
to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the enemy.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.000
In other viral infections, this would be a turning point,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.200
but in rabies, the T cells are rushing towards their doom.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.080
Simple Lissa, with its five proteins, plays a, you know, reverse card,

05:10.080 --> 05:13.120
using the immune system's ingenuity against itself.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.440
Your central nervous system is a very fragile part of your body,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.840
and so the immune system has to be very careful.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.680
A few haywire immune cells in your brain is a quick way to die.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.880
So they aren't free to enter your nervous system,

05:26.880 --> 05:29.440
they have to be invited in and can be kicked out.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.280
To protect themselves, your nerve cells can order T cells to self-destruct,

05:35.280 --> 05:37.120
if they think they're overreacting.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.920
And Lissa figured out a way to make infected neurons express this order.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.160
So as your powerful defense cells arrive, they are ordered to commit suicide.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.440
Now the virus infiltrates the brainstem.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.800
Once this stage is reached, you are going to die.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.040
How Lissa kills.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.960
One of the most irritating things about the Lissa virus

06:00.960 --> 06:05.120
is that we still don't know exactly how and why an infected person dies.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.160
Our usual idea of viruses causing damage is by multiplying rapidly,

06:10.160 --> 06:12.880
killing their host cells once they've made enough copies,

06:12.880 --> 06:16.400
triggering a massive immune reaction that also does a lot of damage.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.600
But this doesn't seem to be what happens here.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.800
Brain tissue of rabies patients shows minimal,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.040
sometimes non-existent damage.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.840
Instead of murdering everything in sight,

06:27.840 --> 06:30.240
it's currently thought that Lissa wreaks havoc

06:30.240 --> 06:33.440
by messing up the neuron communication inside your brain,

06:33.440 --> 06:35.840
so much so that it can't function anymore.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.640
This leads to symptoms like confusion, aggression, and paralysis.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.760
Now the virus begins to leave.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.440
Still traveling through neurons,

06:45.440 --> 06:49.040
it migrates away from the brain and heads for the salivary glands.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.800
This is remarkable, because after traveling in one direction,

06:52.800 --> 06:54.960
the virus reverses its course.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.600
After decades of study, we don't know how this works.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.560
Lissa ends up saturating your saliva,

07:00.560 --> 07:04.000
ready for the irate mammal to bite another and repeat the cycle.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.920
While this seems like the beginning of a zombie outbreak,

07:07.920 --> 07:11.040
luckily there are no known cases of a human biting another

07:11.040 --> 07:12.480
and spreading rabies this way.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.680
Now the end is near.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.160
You are rapidly developing encephalitis,

07:18.160 --> 07:21.760
a swelling of the brain with many unpleasant neurological symptoms,

07:21.760 --> 07:23.520
from lethargy to paralysis.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.360
Slowly at first, and then suddenly, organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.160
There is no known effective therapy.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.720
Barely anyone has ever survived Lissa once symptoms begin to show.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.520
It is by far the deadliest virus we know.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.520
Except, there is actually something that could save you.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.160
A vaccine.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.800
Rabies was one of the first diseases humans developed a vaccine for.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.720
As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for a future attack,

07:52.720 --> 07:55.120
so it has the right weapons ready in high numbers.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.840
The horrific tricks of simple Lissa don't work once you are vaccinated.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.640
And the vaccine is special for another reason.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.200
Because Lissa is so slow in the first few weeks,

08:05.200 --> 08:07.520
it can be given to you after you've been exposed.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.600
So you can still be vaccinated after you've been bitten by an animal.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.200
Which is super important if you've had contact with a sick wild animal,

08:15.200 --> 08:18.880
say a bat, because you often don't even notice a bite from tiny teeth.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.920
Rabies is a monster.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.280
One that has followed our species around for thousands of years,

08:25.280 --> 08:28.400
that our ancestors were terrified of, and rightly so.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.760
It still kills around 60,000 people each year, almost half of them children.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.280
We are far from eradicating this monster.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.280
It lurks in the shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds,

08:41.360 --> 08:45.600
ready to return in greater numbers if we ever forget how to keep it at bay,

08:45.600 --> 08:49.200
or if we continue the trend of being suspicious of vaccines.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.760
Let's hope that one day, humanity slays this monster,

08:53.760 --> 08:57.760
so it can become, like most monsters, part of our imagination.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.280
There are much deeper levels of knowledge to explore about rabies

09:03.280 --> 09:05.120
than the glimpse we just showed you.

09:05.120 --> 09:10.480
But digging into sources and scientific information on your own can be intimidating.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.640
We've partnered with our friends from Brilliant to create an interactive course

09:14.640 --> 09:19.360
with hands-on lessons to guide you through some of the concepts we showed in this video.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.040
Brilliant is an interactive learning tool with over 60 courses in maths,

09:23.040 --> 09:24.720
science and computer science.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.600
They make science accessible with a hands-on approach.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.520
Think of it as a one-on-one tutoring version of a Kurzgesagt video.

09:31.520 --> 09:35.840
You'll experiment with how fast the virus can reach your brain based on its protein makeup,

09:35.840 --> 09:38.800
or run simulations on rabies genetic evolution

09:38.800 --> 09:42.640
to explore how mutations created the deadly virus we know today.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.720
You can do things like manipulate energy to see how black holes are formed,

09:46.720 --> 09:52.480
or control the expansion of space itself to determine the ultimate fate of the universe.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.440

10:12.000 --> 10:14.640
We'd love to go down a rabbit hole with our research.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.240
Brilliant will take you by the hand to come along on the right.

10:33.600 --> 10:54.240
