0	4640	In the 1970s, thousands of chicken heads rained from the sky in Europe,
4640	8080	making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy.
8880	9380	Why?
10160	14160	They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity.
14800	20080	Since the 1930s, a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe,
20080	23280	and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all.
23920	28640	Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage,
28640	31680	and has been haunting us for at least 4,000 years.
32400	37440	It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water.
38080	43200	But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is,
43200	47200	but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.
47200	59520	Viruses exist on the edge between life and death,
59520	64160	hardly more than a few genetic instructions that need living cells to multiply.
64160	67440	The Lyssa virus is simple even for a virus.
67440	73760	It has only 5 genes, that is, the instructions for 5 proteins that let it solve complex problems,
73760	77440	infect a mammal, avoid its immune system, travel to its brain,
77440	80320	make more of itself, and infect new hosts.
81280	83440	Let's see what happens if you get infected.
84160	89600	It all starts with a bite, most likely by a dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva,
89600	91280	pushing them deep into the tissue.
92000	94720	The goal is your nerve cells, your neurons.
95440	99840	They are living electrochemical wires transferring signals throughout your body
99840	102320	and can stretch for up to one and a half meters,
102320	106080	with their cellular machinery on one end and a terminal on the other.
106880	112160	The terminal is where cells talk to each other, by passing chemicals that convey information.
112160	115920	Lyssa probably binds to the receptors that are crucial for this process
115920	118800	and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells.
119600	122400	Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem.
122400	127040	It needs to get to the cellular machinery to take over the cell and make more viruses,
127040	130080	and because neurons are pretty long, this can be far away.
130880	132720	There is a solution at hand, though.
133600	138400	Cells have microtubules spanning their insides that give them structural integrity,
138400	142320	but they also provide a track system for a specialized delivery system.
143280	147440	Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy and deliver packages.
148080	150160	They're made from 50 different proteins,
150160	153440	10 times more than the virus and look like a little pair of shoes.
154400	158480	Lyssa uses one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing system
158480	160320	and order it to head for the nucleus.
161280	163680	What's the immune system doing to prevent all of that?
164240	166720	Well, unfortunately, not much.
167440	168880	Usually, when a virus attacks,
168880	172160	your civilian cells are crucial in activating your immune response.
173040	174880	They notice that they've been infected
174880	178400	and release hundreds of thousands of a special family of proteins,
178400	182240	the interferons that, well, interfere with viruses.
182240	183600	We'll have to simplify a lot,
183600	188640	but in a nutshell, interferons alert your immune system to make antivirus weapons.
188640	189840	But they do much more.
189840	193920	They tell civilian cells to turn down their protein factories for a while,
193920	197040	which means that viruses can't replicate efficiently anymore.
197600	200960	And interferons tell your cells to become super transparent,
200960	203520	which is important, because how can your immune cells
203520	207440	notice that your civilian cells are infected when viruses hide inside them?
208320	212160	Your body solves this by creating display windows into their insides,
212240	214640	called MHC class 1 molecules.
215600	218240	Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive,
218240	221440	and to showcase to your immune cells what's going on inside them,
221440	223600	they take random samples of their products
223600	226800	and put them into these tiny display windows to give a peek inside.
227680	231120	Interferons tell your cells to make way more display windows
231120	232880	and become super transparent.
233760	236720	If a cell is infected and forced to make virus parts,
236720	239280	your immune cells will see these parts in a window
239280	241760	and order the infected cell to kill itself,
241760	243440	and all the viruses trapped within.
244640	248080	This is one of the most powerful methods of wiping out a viral infection.
249040	252880	Unfortunately, Mlyssa blocks your neurons from making interferons
252880	255600	and stays basically invisible to your immune system.
256160	259440	In contrast to many other viruses, when it replicates,
259440	263120	it doesn't kill its host, which would also trigger alarm systems.
264000	267760	Instead, it stealthily jumps from neuron to neuron,
267760	270080	very slowly making its way to your brain.
270960	274720	This phase can take weeks to months, and very rarely even years,
274720	278560	and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite was in your face or foot,
278560	280640	or how many viruses got into your muscles.
281360	283440	Lissa is a patient monster.
283440	286000	Until it reaches its goal, you'll brainstem.
287360	291120	Finally, the immune system catches on that something isn't right and reacts.
291760	295680	It dispatches some of your most powerful antivirus cells, killer T cells,
295680	298640	to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the enemy.
299360	302000	In other viral infections, this would be a turning point,
302000	305200	but in rabies, the T cells are rushing towards their doom.
305840	310080	Simple Lissa, with its five proteins, plays a, you know, reverse card,
310080	313120	using the immune system's ingenuity against itself.
314000	317440	Your central nervous system is a very fragile part of your body,
317440	319840	and so the immune system has to be very careful.
320400	323680	A few haywire immune cells in your brain is a quick way to die.
324320	326880	So they aren't free to enter your nervous system,
326880	329440	they have to be invited in and can be kicked out.
330400	335280	To protect themselves, your nerve cells can order T cells to self-destruct,
335280	337120	if they think they're overreacting.
337840	341920	And Lissa figured out a way to make infected neurons express this order.
343280	348160	So as your powerful defense cells arrive, they are ordered to commit suicide.
349040	351440	Now the virus infiltrates the brainstem.
352000	354800	Once this stage is reached, you are going to die.
355760	357040	How Lissa kills.
358240	360960	One of the most irritating things about the Lissa virus
360960	365120	is that we still don't know exactly how and why an infected person dies.
365840	370160	Our usual idea of viruses causing damage is by multiplying rapidly,
370160	372880	killing their host cells once they've made enough copies,
372880	376400	triggering a massive immune reaction that also does a lot of damage.
377200	379600	But this doesn't seem to be what happens here.
379600	382800	Brain tissue of rabies patients shows minimal,
383200	385040	sometimes non-existent damage.
385760	387840	Instead of murdering everything in sight,
387840	390240	it's currently thought that Lissa wreaks havoc
390240	393440	by messing up the neuron communication inside your brain,
393440	395840	so much so that it can't function anymore.
396480	400640	This leads to symptoms like confusion, aggression, and paralysis.
401600	403760	Now the virus begins to leave.
403760	405440	Still traveling through neurons,
405440	409040	it migrates away from the brain and heads for the salivary glands.
409600	412800	This is remarkable, because after traveling in one direction,
412800	414960	the virus reverses its course.
414960	417600	After decades of study, we don't know how this works.
418160	420560	Lissa ends up saturating your saliva,
420560	424000	ready for the irate mammal to bite another and repeat the cycle.
424960	427920	While this seems like the beginning of a zombie outbreak,
427920	431040	luckily there are no known cases of a human biting another
431040	432480	and spreading rabies this way.
433680	435680	Now the end is near.
435680	438160	You are rapidly developing encephalitis,
438160	441760	a swelling of the brain with many unpleasant neurological symptoms,
441760	443520	from lethargy to paralysis.
444080	449360	Slowly at first, and then suddenly, organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma.
450000	452160	There is no known effective therapy.
452160	456720	Barely anyone has ever survived Lissa once symptoms begin to show.
456720	459520	It is by far the deadliest virus we know.
460320	463520	Except, there is actually something that could save you.
463520	464160	A vaccine.
464880	468800	Rabies was one of the first diseases humans developed a vaccine for.
468800	472720	As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for a future attack,
472720	475120	so it has the right weapons ready in high numbers.
475760	479840	The horrific tricks of simple Lissa don't work once you are vaccinated.
480400	482640	And the vaccine is special for another reason.
482640	485200	Because Lissa is so slow in the first few weeks,
485200	487520	it can be given to you after you've been exposed.
488080	491600	So you can still be vaccinated after you've been bitten by an animal.
491600	495200	Which is super important if you've had contact with a sick wild animal,
495200	498880	say a bat, because you often don't even notice a bite from tiny teeth.
499760	501920	Rabies is a monster.
501920	505280	One that has followed our species around for thousands of years,
505280	508400	that our ancestors were terrified of, and rightly so.
509440	513760	It still kills around 60,000 people each year, almost half of them children.
514560	517280	We are far from eradicating this monster.
517280	521280	It lurks in the shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds,
521360	525600	ready to return in greater numbers if we ever forget how to keep it at bay,
525600	529200	or if we continue the trend of being suspicious of vaccines.
530080	533760	Let's hope that one day, humanity slays this monster,
533760	537760	so it can become, like most monsters, part of our imagination.
540080	543280	There are much deeper levels of knowledge to explore about rabies
543280	545120	than the glimpse we just showed you.
545120	550480	But digging into sources and scientific information on your own can be intimidating.
550720	554640	We've partnered with our friends from Brilliant to create an interactive course
