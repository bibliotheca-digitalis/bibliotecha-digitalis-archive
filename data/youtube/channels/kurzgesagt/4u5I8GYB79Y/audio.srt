1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
In the 1970s, thousands of chicken heads rained from the sky in Europe,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,080
making foxes and other wildlife confused and very happy.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,380
Why?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
They were filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest virus known to humanity.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,080
Since the 1930s, a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across wildlife populations in Europe,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,280
and humans wanted to finally get rid of the virus once and for all.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,640
Rabies is named after Lyssa, the ancient Greek spirit of mad rage,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,680
and has been haunting us for at least 4,000 years.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,440
It can turn animals into angry beasts and humans into zombies that fear water.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,200
But what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how bizarre and deadly its infection is,

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
but also how incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:59,520
Viruses exist on the edge between life and death,

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,160
hardly more than a few genetic instructions that need living cells to multiply.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,440
The Lyssa virus is simple even for a virus.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,760
It has only 5 genes, that is, the instructions for 5 proteins that let it solve complex problems,

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,440
infect a mammal, avoid its immune system, travel to its brain,

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,320
make more of itself, and infect new hosts.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Let's see what happens if you get infected.

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,600
It all starts with a bite, most likely by a dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva,

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
pushing them deep into the tissue.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
The goal is your nerve cells, your neurons.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,840
They are living electrochemical wires transferring signals throughout your body

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
and can stretch for up to one and a half meters,

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,080
with their cellular machinery on one end and a terminal on the other.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,160
The terminal is where cells talk to each other, by passing chemicals that convey information.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,920
Lyssa probably binds to the receptors that are crucial for this process

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,800
and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,040
It needs to get to the cellular machinery to take over the cell and make more viruses,

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
and because neurons are pretty long, this can be far away.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
There is a solution at hand, though.

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Cells have microtubules spanning their insides that give them structural integrity,

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,320
but they also provide a track system for a specialized delivery system.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy and deliver packages.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
They're made from 50 different proteins,

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
10 times more than the virus and look like a little pair of shoes.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,480
Lyssa uses one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing system

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
and order it to head for the nucleus.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
What's the immune system doing to prevent all of that?

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,720
Well, unfortunately, not much.

41
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
Usually, when a virus attacks,

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,160
your civilian cells are crucial in activating your immune response.

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,880
They notice that they've been infected

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,400
and release hundreds of thousands of a special family of proteins,

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,240
the interferons that, well, interfere with viruses.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,600
We'll have to simplify a lot,

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,640
but in a nutshell, interferons alert your immune system to make antivirus weapons.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
But they do much more.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
They tell civilian cells to turn down their protein factories for a while,

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
which means that viruses can't replicate efficiently anymore.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,960
And interferons tell your cells to become super transparent,

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
which is important, because how can your immune cells

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,440
notice that your civilian cells are infected when viruses hide inside them?

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Your body solves this by creating display windows into their insides,

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,640
called MHC class 1 molecules.

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive,

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,440
and to showcase to your immune cells what's going on inside them,

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,600
they take random samples of their products

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,800
and put them into these tiny display windows to give a peek inside.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
Interferons tell your cells to make way more display windows

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
and become super transparent.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
If a cell is infected and forced to make virus parts,

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
your immune cells will see these parts in a window

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
and order the infected cell to kill itself,

65
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,440
and all the viruses trapped within.

66
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
This is one of the most powerful methods of wiping out a viral infection.

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,880
Unfortunately, Mlyssa blocks your neurons from making interferons

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,600
and stays basically invisible to your immune system.

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,440
In contrast to many other viruses, when it replicates,

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
it doesn't kill its host, which would also trigger alarm systems.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,760
Instead, it stealthily jumps from neuron to neuron,

72
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,080
very slowly making its way to your brain.

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
This phase can take weeks to months, and very rarely even years,

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite was in your face or foot,

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,640
or how many viruses got into your muscles.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
Lissa is a patient monster.

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
Until it reaches its goal, you'll brainstem.

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Finally, the immune system catches on that something isn't right and reacts.

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,680
It dispatches some of your most powerful antivirus cells, killer T cells,

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,640
to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the enemy.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
In other viral infections, this would be a turning point,

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,200
but in rabies, the T cells are rushing towards their doom.

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
Simple Lissa, with its five proteins, plays a, you know, reverse card,

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
using the immune system's ingenuity against itself.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
Your central nervous system is a very fragile part of your body,

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
and so the immune system has to be very careful.

87
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,680
A few haywire immune cells in your brain is a quick way to die.

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
So they aren't free to enter your nervous system,

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
they have to be invited in and can be kicked out.

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,280
To protect themselves, your nerve cells can order T cells to self-destruct,

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
if they think they're overreacting.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,920
And Lissa figured out a way to make infected neurons express this order.

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,160
So as your powerful defense cells arrive, they are ordered to commit suicide.

94
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Now the virus infiltrates the brainstem.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Once this stage is reached, you are going to die.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,040
How Lissa kills.

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,960
One of the most irritating things about the Lissa virus

98
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,120
is that we still don't know exactly how and why an infected person dies.

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,160
Our usual idea of viruses causing damage is by multiplying rapidly,

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
killing their host cells once they've made enough copies,

101
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
triggering a massive immune reaction that also does a lot of damage.

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,600
But this doesn't seem to be what happens here.

103
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
Brain tissue of rabies patients shows minimal,

104
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,040
sometimes non-existent damage.

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,840
Instead of murdering everything in sight,

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
it's currently thought that Lissa wreaks havoc

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,440
by messing up the neuron communication inside your brain,

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
so much so that it can't function anymore.

109
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,640
This leads to symptoms like confusion, aggression, and paralysis.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Now the virus begins to leave.

111
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Still traveling through neurons,

112
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,040
it migrates away from the brain and heads for the salivary glands.

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,800
This is remarkable, because after traveling in one direction,

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
the virus reverses its course.

115
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,600
After decades of study, we don't know how this works.

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,560
Lissa ends up saturating your saliva,

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
ready for the irate mammal to bite another and repeat the cycle.

118
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,920
While this seems like the beginning of a zombie outbreak,

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,040
luckily there are no known cases of a human biting another

120
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,480
and spreading rabies this way.

121
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Now the end is near.

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
You are rapidly developing encephalitis,

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,760
a swelling of the brain with many unpleasant neurological symptoms,

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,520
from lethargy to paralysis.

125
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,360
Slowly at first, and then suddenly, organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
There is no known effective therapy.

127
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
Barely anyone has ever survived Lissa once symptoms begin to show.

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
It is by far the deadliest virus we know.

129
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Except, there is actually something that could save you.

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,160
A vaccine.

131
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,800
Rabies was one of the first diseases humans developed a vaccine for.

132
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for a future attack,

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
so it has the right weapons ready in high numbers.

134
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
The horrific tricks of simple Lissa don't work once you are vaccinated.

135
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
And the vaccine is special for another reason.

136
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,200
Because Lissa is so slow in the first few weeks,

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,520
it can be given to you after you've been exposed.

138
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,600
So you can still be vaccinated after you've been bitten by an animal.

139
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,200
Which is super important if you've had contact with a sick wild animal,

140
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,880
say a bat, because you often don't even notice a bite from tiny teeth.

141
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,920
Rabies is a monster.

142
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,280
One that has followed our species around for thousands of years,

143
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
that our ancestors were terrified of, and rightly so.

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
It still kills around 60,000 people each year, almost half of them children.

145
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,280
We are far from eradicating this monster.

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,280
It lurks in the shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds,

147
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
ready to return in greater numbers if we ever forget how to keep it at bay,

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
or if we continue the trend of being suspicious of vaccines.

149
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's hope that one day, humanity slays this monster,

150
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
so it can become, like most monsters, part of our imagination.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,280
There are much deeper levels of knowledge to explore about rabies

152
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
than the glimpse we just showed you.

153
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,480
But digging into sources and scientific information on your own can be intimidating.

154
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
We've partnered with our friends from Brilliant to create an interactive course

155
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,360
with hands-on lessons to guide you through some of the concepts we showed in this video.

156
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
Brilliant is an interactive learning tool with over 60 courses in maths,

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
science and computer science.

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
They make science accessible with a hands-on approach.

159
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,520
Think of it as a one-on-one tutoring version of a Kurzgesagt video.

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,840
You'll experiment with how fast the virus can reach your brain based on its protein makeup,

161
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,800
or run simulations on rabies genetic evolution

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
to explore how mutations created the deadly virus we know today.

163
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,720
You can do things like manipulate energy to see how black holes are formed,

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,480
or control the expansion of space itself to determine the ultimate fate of the universe.

165
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
