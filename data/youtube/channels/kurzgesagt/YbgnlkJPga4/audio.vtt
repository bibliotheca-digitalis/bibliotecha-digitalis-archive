00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Today, we're doing something different.

00:03.800 --> 00:09.320
Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed.

00:09.320 --> 00:17.360
We hope you enjoy it, and we'll be back with a regular video soon.

00:17.360 --> 00:23.720
So if you've ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand

00:23.720 --> 00:24.720
stencils.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.680
They were the first figurative art made by both our kids, somewhere between the ages

00:28.680 --> 00:33.600
of two and three, my children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of

00:33.600 --> 00:38.360
paper, and then, with the help of a parent, traced their five fingers.

00:38.360 --> 00:44.800
I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked to see

00:44.800 --> 00:51.000
the shape of his hand still on the paper, a semi-permanent record of himself.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.880
I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three, and yet to look at their

00:55.880 --> 01:01.800
little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange, soul-splitting

01:01.800 --> 01:03.480
joy.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.680
Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from

01:08.680 --> 01:11.080
me, running toward their own lives.

01:11.080 --> 01:17.200
But of course, that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils, and that complicated

01:17.200 --> 01:22.280
relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking

01:22.280 --> 01:24.720
deeply into the past.

01:24.720 --> 01:31.160
In September of 1940, an 18-year-old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot

01:31.160 --> 01:36.360
in the countryside of southwestern France when the dog disappeared down a hole.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.880
Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends

01:40.880 --> 01:43.080
to explore the hole.

01:43.080 --> 01:48.840
And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings,

01:48.840 --> 01:55.600
including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison, and also species that

01:55.600 --> 01:58.760
are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros.

01:58.760 --> 02:04.080
The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid, with red, yellow, and black paint

02:04.080 --> 02:09.400
made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube,

02:09.400 --> 02:13.640
possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.

02:13.640 --> 02:19.640
It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.680
Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they

02:24.680 --> 02:31.440
saw that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.480
After World War II, the French government took over protection of the site, and the

02:35.480 --> 02:38.760
cave was opened to the public in 1948.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.040
When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year, he reportedly said,

02:43.040 --> 02:45.600
We have invented nothing.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.400
There are many mysteries at Lesko.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.200
Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer, which we know were the primary

02:52.200 --> 02:56.300
source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave?

02:56.300 --> 03:00.920
Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms?

03:00.920 --> 03:05.520
Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling

03:05.520 --> 03:10.640
that required the building of scaffolding to create, while other areas have only a few

03:10.640 --> 03:11.640
paintings?

03:11.640 --> 03:16.840
And were the paintings spiritual, here are our sacred animals, or were they practical?

03:16.840 --> 03:20.400
Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.680
Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot

03:25.680 --> 03:32.520
interpret, and also several negative hand stencils, as they are known by art historians.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.220
These are the paintings that most interest me.

03:35.220 --> 03:40.540
They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave,

03:40.540 --> 03:45.740
and then blowing pigment, leaving the area around the hand painted.

03:45.740 --> 03:51.300
Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain

03:51.300 --> 03:55.100
to Australia to the Americas to Africa.

03:55.100 --> 04:02.900
We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40,000 years ago.

04:02.900 --> 04:07.500
These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.300
Amputations, likely from frostbite, are common in Europe, and so you often see negative hand

04:12.300 --> 04:15.220
stencils with three or four fingers.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.460
And life was short and difficult.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.180
As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth.

04:21.180 --> 04:25.320
Around 50% of children died before the age of five.

04:25.320 --> 04:30.620
But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.980
Their hands indistinguishable from ours.

04:34.980 --> 04:39.860
These communities hunted and gathered, and there were no large caloric surpluses, so

04:39.860 --> 04:45.580
every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water.

04:45.580 --> 04:54.700
And yet somehow, they still made time to create art, almost as if art isn't optional for humans.

04:54.700 --> 05:00.540
We see all kinds of hand stenciled on cave walls, children and adults, but almost always

05:00.540 --> 05:04.060
the fingers are spread, like my kids' hand stencils.

05:04.060 --> 05:09.820
I'm no Jungian, but it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic

05:09.820 --> 05:14.980
humans who couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other, created the same

05:14.980 --> 05:17.820
paintings the same way.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.900
Paintings that we are still making.

05:19.900 --> 05:25.140
But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it

05:25.140 --> 05:27.860
meant to the people who made it.

05:27.860 --> 05:32.200
Some academics theorize that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.580
Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated

05:36.580 --> 05:38.580
at the end of the wrist.

05:38.580 --> 05:43.960
To me though, the hand stencils at Lascaux say, I was here.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.420
They say, you are not new.

05:47.420 --> 05:52.880
And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also look to me like

05:52.880 --> 05:59.920
something out of a horror movie, like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background.

05:59.920 --> 06:05.660
They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, all history is current.

06:05.660 --> 06:09.480
The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now.

06:09.480 --> 06:15.360
Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens,

06:15.360 --> 06:17.740
which has damaged some of the art.

06:17.740 --> 06:21.580
Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess.

06:21.620 --> 06:27.820
But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork

06:27.820 --> 06:31.200
has been meticulously recreated.

06:31.200 --> 06:37.980
Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior,

06:37.980 --> 06:42.860
but I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer

06:42.860 --> 06:49.680
of human activity, I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful that four teenagers and a dog named

06:49.680 --> 06:56.620
Robot discovered a cave with 17,000 year old handprints, that the cave was so overwhelmingly

06:56.620 --> 07:02.180
beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection, and that when

07:02.180 --> 07:08.360
we humans became a danger to that cave's beauty, we agreed to stop going.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.120
Lascaux is there.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.360
You cannot visit.

07:12.360 --> 07:17.920
You can go to the fake cave we've built and see nearly identical hand stencils, but

07:17.920 --> 07:19.360
you will know.

07:19.360 --> 07:24.060
This is not the thing itself, but a shadow of it.

07:24.060 --> 07:28.180
This is a handprint, but not a hand.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.240
This is a memory that you cannot return to.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.780
All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.620
We hope you enjoyed this video, even if it was different.

07:45.820 --> 07:50.540
Check out John Green's podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed, where he poetically reviews the

07:50.540 --> 07:52.260
human world we live in.

07:52.260 --> 07:57.460
John is a good friend of Kurzgesagt, in fact, without his channel Crash Course that he and

07:57.460 --> 08:02.380
his brother Hank started years ago, Kurzgesagt would not exist, because it was the original

08:02.380 --> 08:05.540
inspiration for what we do today.

08:05.540 --> 08:10.380
And over the years, John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways, from advice to

08:10.380 --> 08:12.360
just being friends.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.400
So check out The Anthropocene Reviewed or any of their many channels.
