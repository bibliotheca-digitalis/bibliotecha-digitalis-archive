00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Today, we're doing something different.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,320
Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,360
We hope you enjoy it, and we'll be back with a regular video soon.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,720
So if you've ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
stencils.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
They were the first figurative art made by both our kids, somewhere between the ages

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,600
of two and three, my children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,360
paper, and then, with the help of a parent, traced their five fingers.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,800
I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked to see

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,000
the shape of his hand still on the paper, a semi-permanent record of himself.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,880
I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three, and yet to look at their

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,800
little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange, soul-splitting

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
joy.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,680
Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,080
me, running toward their own lives.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,200
But of course, that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils, and that complicated

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,280
relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,720
deeply into the past.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,160
In September of 1940, an 18-year-old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,360
in the countryside of southwestern France when the dog disappeared down a hole.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,880
Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
to explore the hole.

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,840
And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings,

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,600
including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison, and also species that

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,760
are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,080
The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid, with red, yellow, and black paint

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,400
made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube,

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,640
possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,640
It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,440
saw that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,480
After World War II, the French government took over protection of the site, and the

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,760
cave was opened to the public in 1948.

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,040
When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year, he reportedly said,

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,600
We have invented nothing.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
There are many mysteries at Lesko.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,200
Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer, which we know were the primary

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,300
source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave?

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,920
Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms?

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,520
Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,640
that required the building of scaffolding to create, while other areas have only a few

42
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
paintings?

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,840
And were the paintings spiritual, here are our sacred animals, or were they practical?

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,520
interpret, and also several negative hand stencils, as they are known by art historians.

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,220
These are the paintings that most interest me.

48
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,540
They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave,

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,740
and then blowing pigment, leaving the area around the hand painted.

50
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,300
Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain

51
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,100
to Australia to the Americas to Africa.

52
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,900
We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40,000 years ago.

53
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,500
These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past.

54
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,300
Amputations, likely from frostbite, are common in Europe, and so you often see negative hand

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,220
stencils with three or four fingers.

56
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,460
And life was short and difficult.

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,180
As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth.

58
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,320
Around 50% of children died before the age of five.

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,620
But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are.

60
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,980
Their hands indistinguishable from ours.

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,860
These communities hunted and gathered, and there were no large caloric surpluses, so

62
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,580
every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water.

63
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:54,700
And yet somehow, they still made time to create art, almost as if art isn't optional for humans.

64
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,540
We see all kinds of hand stenciled on cave walls, children and adults, but almost always

65
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,060
the fingers are spread, like my kids' hand stencils.

66
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,820
I'm no Jungian, but it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic

67
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,980
humans who couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other, created the same

68
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,820
paintings the same way.

69
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,900
Paintings that we are still making.

70
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,140
But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it

71
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,860
meant to the people who made it.

72
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,200
Some academics theorize that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,580
Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated

74
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
at the end of the wrist.

75
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,960
To me though, the hand stencils at Lascaux say, I was here.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,420
They say, you are not new.

77
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,880
And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also look to me like

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,920
something out of a horror movie, like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background.

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,660
They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, all history is current.

80
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,480
The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now.

81
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,360
Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens,

82
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,740
which has damaged some of the art.

83
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,580
Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess.

84
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,820
But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork

85
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,200
has been meticulously recreated.

86
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,980
Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior,

87
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,860
but I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,680
of human activity, I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful that four teenagers and a dog named

89
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,620
Robot discovered a cave with 17,000 year old handprints, that the cave was so overwhelmingly

90
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,180
beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection, and that when

91
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,360
we humans became a danger to that cave's beauty, we agreed to stop going.

92
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Lascaux is there.

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,360
You cannot visit.

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,920
You can go to the fake cave we've built and see nearly identical hand stencils, but

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,360
you will know.

96
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,060
This is not the thing itself, but a shadow of it.

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,180
This is a handprint, but not a hand.

98
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,240
This is a memory that you cannot return to.

99
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,780
All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents.

100
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,620
We hope you enjoyed this video, even if it was different.

101
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,540
Check out John Green's podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed, where he poetically reviews the

102
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,260
human world we live in.

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,460
John is a good friend of Kurzgesagt, in fact, without his channel Crash Course that he and

104
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,380
his brother Hank started years ago, Kurzgesagt would not exist, because it was the original

105
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,540
inspiration for what we do today.

106
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,380
And over the years, John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways, from advice to

107
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,360
just being friends.

108
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,400
So check out The Anthropocene Reviewed or any of their many channels.
