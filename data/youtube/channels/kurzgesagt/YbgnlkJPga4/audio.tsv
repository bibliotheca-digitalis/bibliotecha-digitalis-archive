0	3800	Today, we're doing something different.
3800	9320	Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed.
9320	17360	We hope you enjoy it, and we'll be back with a regular video soon.
17360	23720	So if you've ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand
23720	24720	stencils.
24720	28680	They were the first figurative art made by both our kids, somewhere between the ages
28680	33600	of two and three, my children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of
33600	38360	paper, and then, with the help of a parent, traced their five fingers.
38360	44800	I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked to see
44800	51000	the shape of his hand still on the paper, a semi-permanent record of himself.
51000	55880	I am extremely happy that my children are no longer three, and yet to look at their
55880	61800	little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange, soul-splitting
61800	63480	joy.
63480	68680	Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from
68680	71080	me, running toward their own lives.
71080	77200	But of course, that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils, and that complicated
77200	82280	relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking
82280	84720	deeply into the past.
84720	91160	In September of 1940, an 18-year-old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot
91160	96360	in the countryside of southwestern France when the dog disappeared down a hole.
96360	100880	Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends
100880	103080	to explore the hole.
103080	108840	And after quite a bit of digging, they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings,
108840	115600	including over 900 paintings of animals, horses, stags, bison, and also species that
115600	118760	are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros.
118760	124080	The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid, with red, yellow, and black paint
124080	129400	made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube,
129400	133640	possibly a hollowed bone, onto the walls of the cave.
133640	139640	It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old.
139640	144680	Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they
144680	151440	saw that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year.
151440	155480	After World War II, the French government took over protection of the site, and the
155480	158760	cave was opened to the public in 1948.
158760	163040	When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year, he reportedly said,
163040	165600	We have invented nothing.
165600	167400	There are many mysteries at Lesko.
167400	172200	Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer, which we know were the primary
172200	176300	source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave?
176300	180920	Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms?
180920	185520	Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling
185520	190640	that required the building of scaffolding to create, while other areas have only a few
190640	191640	paintings?
191640	196840	And were the paintings spiritual, here are our sacred animals, or were they practical?
196840	200400	Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you.
200400	205680	Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot
205680	212520	interpret, and also several negative hand stencils, as they are known by art historians.
212520	215220	These are the paintings that most interest me.
215220	220540	They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave,
220540	225740	and then blowing pigment, leaving the area around the hand painted.
225740	231300	Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain
231300	235100	to Australia to the Americas to Africa.
235100	242900	We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40,000 years ago.
242900	247500	These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past.
247500	252300	Amputations, likely from frostbite, are common in Europe, and so you often see negative hand
252300	255220	stencils with three or four fingers.
255220	257460	And life was short and difficult.
257460	261180	As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth.
261180	265320	Around 50% of children died before the age of five.
265320	270620	But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are.
270620	274980	Their hands indistinguishable from ours.
274980	279860	These communities hunted and gathered, and there were no large caloric surpluses, so
279860	285580	every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water.
285580	294700	And yet somehow, they still made time to create art, almost as if art isn't optional for humans.
294700	300540	We see all kinds of hand stenciled on cave walls, children and adults, but almost always
300540	304060	the fingers are spread, like my kids' hand stencils.
304060	309820	I'm no Jungian, but it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic
309820	314980	humans who couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other, created the same
314980	317820	paintings the same way.
317820	319900	Paintings that we are still making.
319900	325140	But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it
325140	327860	meant to the people who made it.
327860	332200	Some academics theorize that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals.
332200	336580	Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated
336580	338580	at the end of the wrist.
338580	343960	To me though, the hand stencils at Lascaux say, I was here.
343960	347420	They say, you are not new.
347420	352880	And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also look to me like
352880	359920	something out of a horror movie, like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background.
359920	365660	They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, all history is current.
365660	369480	The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now.
369480	375360	Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens,
375360	377740	which has damaged some of the art.
377740	381580	Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess.
381620	387820	But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork
387820	391200	has been meticulously recreated.
391200	397980	Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior,
397980	402860	but I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer
402860	409680	of human activity, I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful that four teenagers and a dog named
409680	416620	Robot discovered a cave with 17,000 year old handprints, that the cave was so overwhelmingly
416620	422180	beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection, and that when
422180	428360	we humans became a danger to that cave's beauty, we agreed to stop going.
428360	430120	Lascaux is there.
430120	432360	You cannot visit.
432360	437920	You can go to the fake cave we've built and see nearly identical hand stencils, but
437920	439360	you will know.
439360	444060	This is not the thing itself, but a shadow of it.
444060	448180	This is a handprint, but not a hand.
448180	452240	This is a memory that you cannot return to.
452240	456780	All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents.
462680	465620	We hope you enjoyed this video, even if it was different.
465820	470540	Check out John Green's podcast, The Anthropocene Reviewed, where he poetically reviews the
470540	472260	human world we live in.
472260	477460	John is a good friend of Kurzgesagt, in fact, without his channel Crash Course that he and
477460	482380	his brother Hank started years ago, Kurzgesagt would not exist, because it was the original
482380	485540	inspiration for what we do today.
485540	490380	And over the years, John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways, from advice to
490380	492360	just being friends.
492360	496400	So check out The Anthropocene Reviewed or any of their many channels.
