0	4200	Hey YouTube, have you ever wondered why we only upload one video each month?
4200	7000	Well, the answer is really easy, time and money.
7000	11500	It's fun of course, but to make animation videos like this, a ridiculous amount of time is necessary,
11500	19000	writing the script, storyboard, designing all the stuff, recording the narration, animation, sound design, and composing original music.
19000	24000	We would love to make more videos, but it's just impossible right now without a time machine.
24000	28500	We all have real jobs and do Kurzgesagt late nights and on the weekends, because it's our passion.
28500	33000	But we'd prefer doing it while the sun is shining and make more videos for you guys.
33000	37000	But now, you can help us make more science and educational content.
37000	39500	There's this great new thing called Patreon.
39500	44500	Patreon is a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter, but it works on a monthly basis with smaller amounts.
44500	50000	If you want, you can support us with a small sum each month, and we'll spend less time working elsewhere and make more videos.
50000	54000	Depending on the amount, you'll get cool rewards like graphics for your smartphone or computer,
54000	58000	our music, links in the video description, or I'll record your voicemail message.
58000	62500	This is the mailbox of a man called Jimmy. Something like that.
62500	65500	Even the smallest amounts help, and we really appreciate it.
65500	70500	Our videos will stay free on YouTube forever, so if you don't want to fund us, nothing will change for you.
70500	76500	If we get enough money through Patreon, we can invest more time in Kurzgesagt and make more than one video every four weeks in the future.
76500	80500	Thank you all for your attention. Lots of love for all the feels. Kurzgesagt.
