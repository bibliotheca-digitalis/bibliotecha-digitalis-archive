Hey YouTube, have you ever wondered why we only upload one video each month?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, the answer is really easy, time and money.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,500
It's fun of course, but to make animation videos like this, a ridiculous amount of time is necessary,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:19,000
writing the script, storyboard, designing all the stuff, recording the narration, animation, sound design, and composing original music.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We would love to make more videos, but it's just impossible right now without a time machine.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
We all have real jobs and do Kurzgesagt late nights and on the weekends, because it's our passion.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
But we'd prefer doing it while the sun is shining and make more videos for you guys.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But now, you can help us make more science and educational content.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
There's this great new thing called Patreon.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Patreon is a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter, but it works on a monthly basis with smaller amounts.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,000
If you want, you can support us with a small sum each month, and we'll spend less time working elsewhere and make more videos.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Depending on the amount, you'll get cool rewards like graphics for your smartphone or computer,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
our music, links in the video description, or I'll record your voicemail message.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,500
This is the mailbox of a man called Jimmy. Something like that.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Even the smallest amounts help, and we really appreciate it.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Our videos will stay free on YouTube forever, so if you don't want to fund us, nothing will change for you.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,500
If we get enough money through Patreon, we can invest more time in Kurzgesagt and make more than one video every four weeks in the future.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Thank you all for your attention. Lots of love for all the feels. Kurzgesagt.
