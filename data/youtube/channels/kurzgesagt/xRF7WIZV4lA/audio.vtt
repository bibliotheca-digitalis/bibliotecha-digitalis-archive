Hey YouTube, have you ever wondered why we only upload one video each month?

00:04.200 --> 00:07.000
Well, the answer is really easy, time and money.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.500
It's fun of course, but to make animation videos like this, a ridiculous amount of time is necessary,

00:11.500 --> 00:19.000
writing the script, storyboard, designing all the stuff, recording the narration, animation, sound design, and composing original music.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
We would love to make more videos, but it's just impossible right now without a time machine.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.500
We all have real jobs and do Kurzgesagt late nights and on the weekends, because it's our passion.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.000
But we'd prefer doing it while the sun is shining and make more videos for you guys.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
But now, you can help us make more science and educational content.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.500
There's this great new thing called Patreon.

00:39.500 --> 00:44.500
Patreon is a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter, but it works on a monthly basis with smaller amounts.

00:44.500 --> 00:50.000
If you want, you can support us with a small sum each month, and we'll spend less time working elsewhere and make more videos.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Depending on the amount, you'll get cool rewards like graphics for your smartphone or computer,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
our music, links in the video description, or I'll record your voicemail message.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.500
This is the mailbox of a man called Jimmy. Something like that.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.500
Even the smallest amounts help, and we really appreciate it.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.500
Our videos will stay free on YouTube forever, so if you don't want to fund us, nothing will change for you.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.500
If we get enough money through Patreon, we can invest more time in Kurzgesagt and make more than one video every four weeks in the future.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.500
Thank you all for your attention. Lots of love for all the feels. Kurzgesagt.
