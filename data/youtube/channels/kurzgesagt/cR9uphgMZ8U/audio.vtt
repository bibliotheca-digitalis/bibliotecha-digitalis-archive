00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
The 14 moons of Neptune are a strange bunch.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.380
Most of them are small potato-shaped pieces of ice and rock.

00:09.380 --> 00:15.560
Some are so far away from Neptune that they need 29 years to circle Neptune once.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.760
Almost all of them are asteroids trapped by Neptune's gravity.

00:19.760 --> 00:26.060
99.5% of all the mass around Neptune is concentrated in Triton.

00:26.060 --> 00:31.200
It's the seventh biggest moon and more massive than all other known moons in the solar system

00:31.200 --> 00:34.260
that are smaller than itself combined.

00:34.260 --> 00:38.620
Its surface area is about as big as the mainland of Russia and Australia together.

00:38.620 --> 00:45.880
Also, Triton is one of only four objects in the solar system that we know is geologically active.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.820
Triton orbits Neptune in the wrong direction against the rotation of Neptune, which is

00:50.820 --> 00:54.840
unique in our solar system for an object as big as Triton.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.300
We can conclude from this that Triton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably

00:59.300 --> 01:04.540
was a dwarf planet that was forced into submission by Neptune when the solar system was younger

01:04.540 --> 01:06.700
and more chaotic.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.240
The most popular theory here is that Triton was once part of a double system.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.700
When Neptune migrated to the outer edges of the solar system, its gravity interfered with

01:15.700 --> 01:22.260
the double system and catapulted the other object into space, while Triton was forced into orbit.

01:22.260 --> 01:26.620
This would have disrupted the orbits of other Neptune moons rather violently and would most

01:26.620 --> 01:32.480
likely have either pushed them away from Neptune or let them collide or crash into Neptune.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.700
This would explain why Neptune's moons are so dominated by Triton.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.160
But this will end one day.

01:40.160 --> 01:46.240
Triton is being slowed down by Neptune, and eventually it will either crash into it or

01:46.240 --> 01:52.300
be ground by Neptune's gravity into a huge ring system similar to Saturn's.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.260
So don't buy real estate on Triton.
