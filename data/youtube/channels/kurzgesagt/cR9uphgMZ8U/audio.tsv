0	5200	The 14 moons of Neptune are a strange bunch.
5200	9380	Most of them are small potato-shaped pieces of ice and rock.
9380	15560	Some are so far away from Neptune that they need 29 years to circle Neptune once.
15560	19760	Almost all of them are asteroids trapped by Neptune's gravity.
19760	26060	99.5% of all the mass around Neptune is concentrated in Triton.
26060	31200	It's the seventh biggest moon and more massive than all other known moons in the solar system
31200	34260	that are smaller than itself combined.
34260	38620	Its surface area is about as big as the mainland of Russia and Australia together.
38620	45880	Also, Triton is one of only four objects in the solar system that we know is geologically active.
45880	50820	Triton orbits Neptune in the wrong direction against the rotation of Neptune, which is
50820	54840	unique in our solar system for an object as big as Triton.
54840	59300	We can conclude from this that Triton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably
59300	64540	was a dwarf planet that was forced into submission by Neptune when the solar system was younger
64540	66700	and more chaotic.
66700	71240	The most popular theory here is that Triton was once part of a double system.
71240	75700	When Neptune migrated to the outer edges of the solar system, its gravity interfered with
75700	82260	the double system and catapulted the other object into space, while Triton was forced into orbit.
82260	86620	This would have disrupted the orbits of other Neptune moons rather violently and would most
86620	92480	likely have either pushed them away from Neptune or let them collide or crash into Neptune.
92480	97700	This would explain why Neptune's moons are so dominated by Triton.
97700	100160	But this will end one day.
100160	106240	Triton is being slowed down by Neptune, and eventually it will either crash into it or
106240	112300	be ground by Neptune's gravity into a huge ring system similar to Saturn's.
112300	114260	So don't buy real estate on Triton.
