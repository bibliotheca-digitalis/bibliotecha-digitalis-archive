1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The 14 moons of Neptune are a strange bunch.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,380
Most of them are small potato-shaped pieces of ice and rock.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,560
Some are so far away from Neptune that they need 29 years to circle Neptune once.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,760
Almost all of them are asteroids trapped by Neptune's gravity.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,060
99.5% of all the mass around Neptune is concentrated in Triton.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,200
It's the seventh biggest moon and more massive than all other known moons in the solar system

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,260
that are smaller than itself combined.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,620
Its surface area is about as big as the mainland of Russia and Australia together.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,880
Also, Triton is one of only four objects in the solar system that we know is geologically active.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,820
Triton orbits Neptune in the wrong direction against the rotation of Neptune, which is

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,840
unique in our solar system for an object as big as Triton.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,300
We can conclude from this that Triton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,540
was a dwarf planet that was forced into submission by Neptune when the solar system was younger

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,700
and more chaotic.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,240
The most popular theory here is that Triton was once part of a double system.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,700
When Neptune migrated to the outer edges of the solar system, its gravity interfered with

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,260
the double system and catapulted the other object into space, while Triton was forced into orbit.

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,620
This would have disrupted the orbits of other Neptune moons rather violently and would most

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,480
likely have either pushed them away from Neptune or let them collide or crash into Neptune.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,700
This would explain why Neptune's moons are so dominated by Triton.

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,160
But this will end one day.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,240
Triton is being slowed down by Neptune, and eventually it will either crash into it or

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,300
be ground by Neptune's gravity into a huge ring system similar to Saturn's.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,260
So don't buy real estate on Triton.
