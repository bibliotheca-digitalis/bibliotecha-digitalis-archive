00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach,

00:05.680 --> 00:13.040
no matter how hard we try? Turns out, there are. Even with science fiction technology,

00:13.040 --> 00:19.780
we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go?

00:19.780 --> 00:34.140
We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy of average size,

00:34.140 --> 00:40.580
about 100,000 light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter,

00:40.580 --> 00:46.540
black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic center.

00:47.420 --> 00:54.100
From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality, it consists mostly of empty space.

00:54.100 --> 01:00.580
With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star would take thousands of years.

01:00.580 --> 01:08.860
So our galaxy is pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda Galaxy

01:08.860 --> 01:14.780
and more than 50 dwarf galaxies, it's part of the Local Group, a region of space about 10

01:14.780 --> 01:19.580
million light years in diameter. It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea

01:19.580 --> 01:26.020
supercluster, which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the

01:26.020 --> 01:32.700
observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity

01:32.700 --> 01:38.780
becomes a Type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel

01:38.780 --> 01:44.980
based on our current understanding of physics. In this best-case scenario, how far could we

01:44.980 --> 01:51.940
possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a

01:51.940 --> 02:02.620
part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000001% of the

02:02.620 --> 02:10.540
observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth

02:10.540 --> 02:16.620
of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for

02:16.620 --> 02:21.820
us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch, is kind of frightening.

02:21.820 --> 02:31.500
Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty

02:31.500 --> 02:39.380
space, isn't empty, but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the

02:39.380 --> 02:45.220
smallest scale, there is constant action, particles and antiparticles appearing and annihilating

02:45.220 --> 02:51.980
themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions.

02:51.980 --> 02:59.740
Now, let's go back 13.8 billion years when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right

02:59.780 --> 03:05.380
after the Big Bang, in an event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from

03:05.380 --> 03:12.180
the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching

03:12.180 --> 03:18.140
of the universe was so fast and extreme that all those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,

03:18.140 --> 03:26.980
and subatomic distances became galactic distances, with dense and less dense regions. After inflation,

03:26.980 --> 03:33.620
gravity began to pull everything back together. At the largest scale, the expansion was too quick

03:33.620 --> 03:40.780
and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales, gravity emerged victorious. So over time, the

03:40.780 --> 03:46.300
denser regions or pockets of the universe grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in

03:46.300 --> 03:54.020
today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the local group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait,

03:54.060 --> 04:00.180
what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here,

04:00.180 --> 04:06.980
dark energy makes everything complicated. About 6 billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's

04:06.980 --> 04:13.060
basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We

04:13.060 --> 04:19.460
don't know why or what dark energy is, but we could observe its effect clearly. In the early

04:19.460 --> 04:24.060
universe, there were larger cold spots around the local group that grew into large clusters

04:24.060 --> 04:30.940
with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and

04:30.940 --> 04:36.200
galaxies outside of the local group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the

04:36.200 --> 04:42.780
universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over

04:42.780 --> 04:47.500
time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other

04:47.540 --> 04:53.340
clusters, galaxies, and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is

04:53.340 --> 04:58.700
already millions of light years away, but all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't

04:58.700 --> 05:04.420
ever hope to match. We could leave the local group and fly through intergalactic space into the

05:04.420 --> 05:10.340
darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded,

05:10.340 --> 05:15.780
the local group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical

05:15.780 --> 05:23.180
galaxy with the unoriginal name Milkdrometer in a few billion years. But it becomes even more

05:23.180 --> 05:29.060
depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the local group will be so far away that they

05:29.060 --> 05:33.940
will be too faint to detect, and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such

05:33.940 --> 05:40.180
long wavelengths that they'll be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside of the

05:40.180 --> 05:45.740
local group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be

05:45.740 --> 05:53.180
dark and empty in all directions forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdrometer will think

05:53.180 --> 05:58.460
there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe. When they look far into empty space,

05:58.460 --> 06:04.380
they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background

06:04.380 --> 06:09.500
radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing

06:09.500 --> 06:15.100
what we know today, the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.

06:15.100 --> 06:22.660
They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdrometer will be an island in the

06:22.660 --> 06:29.980
darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is

06:29.980 --> 06:35.500
certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar

06:35.500 --> 06:41.700
system, and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist

06:41.700 --> 06:49.180
at the perfect moment in time to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated

06:49.180 --> 06:55.940
and remote as the local group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it

06:55.940 --> 07:01.580
is right now. Thanks so much for the help with the video to Ethan Siegel. Check out his astronomy
