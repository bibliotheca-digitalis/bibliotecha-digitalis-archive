0	5680	Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach,
5680	13040	no matter how hard we try? Turns out, there are. Even with science fiction technology,
13040	19780	we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go?
19780	34140	We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy of average size,
34140	40580	about 100,000 light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter,
40580	46540	black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic center.
47420	54100	From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality, it consists mostly of empty space.
54100	60580	With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star would take thousands of years.
60580	68860	So our galaxy is pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda Galaxy
68860	74780	and more than 50 dwarf galaxies, it's part of the Local Group, a region of space about 10
74780	79580	million light years in diameter. It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea
79580	86020	supercluster, which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the
86020	92700	observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity
92700	98780	becomes a Type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel
98780	104980	based on our current understanding of physics. In this best-case scenario, how far could we
104980	111940	possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a
111940	122620	part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000001% of the
122620	130540	observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth
130540	136620	of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for
136620	141820	us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch, is kind of frightening.
141820	151500	Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty
151500	159380	space, isn't empty, but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the
159380	165220	smallest scale, there is constant action, particles and antiparticles appearing and annihilating
165220	171980	themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions.
171980	179740	Now, let's go back 13.8 billion years when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right
179780	185380	after the Big Bang, in an event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from
185380	192180	the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching
192180	198140	of the universe was so fast and extreme that all those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,
198140	206980	and subatomic distances became galactic distances, with dense and less dense regions. After inflation,
206980	213620	gravity began to pull everything back together. At the largest scale, the expansion was too quick
213620	220780	and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales, gravity emerged victorious. So over time, the
220780	226300	denser regions or pockets of the universe grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in
226300	234020	today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the local group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait,
234060	240180	what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here,
240180	246980	dark energy makes everything complicated. About 6 billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's
246980	253060	basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We
253060	259460	don't know why or what dark energy is, but we could observe its effect clearly. In the early
259460	264060	universe, there were larger cold spots around the local group that grew into large clusters
264060	270940	with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and
270940	276200	galaxies outside of the local group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the
276200	282780	universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over
282780	287500	time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other
287540	293340	clusters, galaxies, and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is
293340	298700	already millions of light years away, but all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't
298700	304420	ever hope to match. We could leave the local group and fly through intergalactic space into the
304420	310340	darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded,
310340	315780	the local group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical
315780	323180	galaxy with the unoriginal name Milkdrometer in a few billion years. But it becomes even more
323180	329060	depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the local group will be so far away that they
329060	333940	will be too faint to detect, and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such
333940	340180	long wavelengths that they'll be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside of the
340180	345740	local group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be
345740	353180	dark and empty in all directions forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdrometer will think
353180	358460	there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe. When they look far into empty space,
358460	364380	they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background
364380	369500	radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing
369500	375100	what we know today, the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.
375100	382660	They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdrometer will be an island in the
382660	389980	darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is
389980	395500	certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar
395500	401700	system, and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist
401700	409180	at the perfect moment in time to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated
409180	415940	and remote as the local group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it
415940	421580	is right now. Thanks so much for the help with the video to Ethan Siegel. Check out his astronomy
