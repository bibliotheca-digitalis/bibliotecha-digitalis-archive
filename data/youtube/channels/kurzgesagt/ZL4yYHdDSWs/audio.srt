1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach,

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,040
no matter how hard we try? Turns out, there are. Even with science fiction technology,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,780
we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go?

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:34,140
We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy of average size,

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,580
about 100,000 light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter,

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,540
black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic center.

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,100
From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality, it consists mostly of empty space.

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,580
With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star would take thousands of years.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,860
So our galaxy is pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda Galaxy

10
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,780
and more than 50 dwarf galaxies, it's part of the Local Group, a region of space about 10

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,580
million light years in diameter. It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,020
supercluster, which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,700
observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,780
becomes a Type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel

15
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,980
based on our current understanding of physics. In this best-case scenario, how far could we

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,940
possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a

17
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:02,620
part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000001% of the

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:10,540
observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth

19
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:16,620
of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for

20
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,820
us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch, is kind of frightening.

21
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:31,500
Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,380
space, isn't empty, but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the

23
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,220
smallest scale, there is constant action, particles and antiparticles appearing and annihilating

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,980
themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions.

25
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:59,740
Now, let's go back 13.8 billion years when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right

26
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,380
after the Big Bang, in an event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,180
the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching

28
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,140
of the universe was so fast and extreme that all those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well,

29
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,980
and subatomic distances became galactic distances, with dense and less dense regions. After inflation,

30
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,620
gravity began to pull everything back together. At the largest scale, the expansion was too quick

31
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,780
and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales, gravity emerged victorious. So over time, the

32
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,300
denser regions or pockets of the universe grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in

33
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,020
today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the local group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait,

34
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,180
what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here,

35
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,980
dark energy makes everything complicated. About 6 billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's

36
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,060
basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We

37
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,460
don't know why or what dark energy is, but we could observe its effect clearly. In the early

38
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,060
universe, there were larger cold spots around the local group that grew into large clusters

39
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,940
with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and

40
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,200
galaxies outside of the local group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the

41
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,780
universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over

42
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,500
time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other

43
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,340
clusters, galaxies, and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is

44
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,700
already millions of light years away, but all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't

45
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,420
ever hope to match. We could leave the local group and fly through intergalactic space into the

46
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,340
darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded,

47
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,780
the local group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical

48
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:23,180
galaxy with the unoriginal name Milkdrometer in a few billion years. But it becomes even more

49
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,060
depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the local group will be so far away that they

50
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,940
will be too faint to detect, and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such

51
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,180
long wavelengths that they'll be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside of the

52
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,740
local group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be

53
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,180
dark and empty in all directions forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdrometer will think

54
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,460
there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe. When they look far into empty space,

55
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,380
they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background

56
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,500
radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,100
what we know today, the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.

58
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:22,660
They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdrometer will be an island in the

59
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:29,980
darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is

60
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,500
certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar

61
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,700
system, and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist

62
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:49,180
at the perfect moment in time to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated

63
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,940
and remote as the local group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it

64
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,580
is right now. Thanks so much for the help with the video to Ethan Siegel. Check out his astronomy
