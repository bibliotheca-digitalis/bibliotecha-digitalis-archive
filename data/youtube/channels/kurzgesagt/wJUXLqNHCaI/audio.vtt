00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Over 40 years ago, US President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one,

00:05.600 --> 00:09.600
starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.800
Today, the numbers are in.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.600
The War on Drugs is a huge failure with devastating unintended consequences.

00:16.600 --> 00:23.400
It led to mass incarceration in the US, to corruption, political destabilization and violence in Latin America,

00:23.400 --> 00:28.000
Asia and Africa, to systemic human rights abuses across the world.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.600
It negatively affected the lives of millions of people.

00:31.600 --> 00:37.800
All of this, while we waste billions of dollars every year, only to create and fuel powerful drug cartels,

00:37.800 --> 00:41.600
while the goal of the War on Drugs seems less achievable than ever.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.400
A world without drugs.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.600
How could this happen?

00:44.600 --> 00:54.400
The War on Drugs

00:54.400 --> 00:58.800
The core strategy of the War on Drugs is no drugs, no problems.

00:58.800 --> 01:04.200
So almost all of the efforts in the last few decades have been focused on eradicating the supply of drugs

01:04.200 --> 01:06.600
and incarcerating drug traffickers.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.600
But this ignores the most fundamental of market forces, supply and demand.

01:11.800 --> 01:17.200
If you reduce the supply of anything without reducing the demand first, its price goes up.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.000
This might lower sales for many products, but not for drugs.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The drugs market is not price-sensitive.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.800
Drugs will be consumed no matter what they cost.

01:26.800 --> 01:34.400
So the effect is to encourage production of more drugs and recruitment of more traffickers, which increases availability.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.200
This is also known as the balloon effect.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.600
Even if drug production or a major supply route is destroyed, the supply for the end user is not reduced.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.600
A perfect example of this is crystal meth.

01:46.600 --> 01:53.200
The US government tried to stop its production by strictly regulating the sale of chemicals used to manufacture the drug.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.600
This forced big meth producers out of business,

01:55.600 --> 02:01.200
but the unintended consequences were that thousands of small-scale operations started all over the country,

02:01.200 --> 02:06.200
mostly in small towns and rural communities, using chemicals that weren't regulated.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.800
In response to this, some US states wanted to reduce the supply of homegrown meth by regulating even more chemicals,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.800
which reduced small-scale meth production drastically.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.600
But the supply of meth still stayed the same.

02:18.600 --> 02:23.600
Mexican drug cartels immediately took over and opened big production operations.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.800
Their meth was even better than it was before, and they had loads of experience in smuggling.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.800
So all these efforts made meth production more professional, the drug more potent, while supply wasn't reduced at all.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.600
You can't win this war on the supply side.

02:38.600 --> 02:44.400
Not only are drugs widely available, demand unbroken, and some drugs purer than in the past,

02:44.400 --> 02:50.600
with a budget of around $30 billion, the US Drug Enforcement Agency has an efficiency rate of less than 1%

02:50.600 --> 02:55.000
when it comes to stopping the flow of drugs into the US and inside the US.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.200
For many minors around the world, it's as easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.600
But it doesn't stop here.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.800
Prohibition may prevent a certain amount of people from taking drugs,

03:04.800 --> 03:09.200
but in the process, it causes huge damage to society as a whole.

03:09.200 --> 03:14.200
Many of the problems we associate with drug use are actually caused by the war against them.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.200
For example, prohibition makes drugs stronger.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.000
The more potent drugs you can store in as little space as possible, the more profit you'll make.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.400
It was the same during alcohol prohibition, which led to an increased consumption of strong liquor over beer.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.600
The prohibition of drugs also led to more violence and murders around the world.

03:31.600 --> 03:37.200
Gangs and cartels have no access to the legal system to settle disputes, so they use violence.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.400
This led to an ever-increasing spiral of brutality.

03:40.400 --> 03:47.400
According to some estimates, the homicide rate in the US is 25 to 75% higher because of the war on drugs.

03:47.400 --> 03:56.000
And in Mexico, a country on the front line, an estimated 164,000 have been murdered between 2007 and 2014.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.600
More people than in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq in the same period combined.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.600
But where the war on drugs might do the most damage to society is the incarceration of non-violent drug offenders.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.800
For example, the United States, one of the driving forces of the war on drugs,

04:10.800 --> 04:16.800
has 5% of the world's total population, but 25% of the world's prison population,

04:16.800 --> 04:20.800
largely due to the harsh punishments and mandatory minimums.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.600
Minorities suffer because of this especially.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.200
African Americans make up 40% of all US prison inmates.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.200
And while white kids are more likely to abuse drugs,

04:30.200 --> 04:34.200
black kids are 10 times more likely to get arrested for drug offenses.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.400
Okay, but is there actually something different we can do?

04:37.400 --> 04:39.400
Is there a way out of this mess?

04:39.400 --> 04:44.400
In the 1980s, Switzerland experienced a public health crisis related to heroin use.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.800
HIV rates skyrocketed and street crime became a problem.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.400
Swiss authorities tried a new strategy, harm reduction.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.200
They opened free heroin maintenance centers where addicts would be treated and stabilized.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.400
Here, people would be given free heroin of high quality, they would get clean needles,

05:01.400 --> 05:06.800
and have access to safe injection rooms, showers, beds, and medical supervision.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.400
Social workers helped them find housing and deal with other problems in their lives.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.200
The results were a sharp drop in drug-related crime,

05:14.200 --> 05:17.000
and two-thirds of the people in the centers got regular jobs

05:17.000 --> 05:21.600
because now they could focus on getting better instead of financing their addiction.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.400
Today, over 70% of all heroin addicts in Switzerland receive treatment.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.200
HIV infections have dropped drastically.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.200
Deaths from heroin overdoses have dropped by 50%.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.600
And drug-related street sex work and crime has been reduced enormously.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.200
So there are methods that are not only way cheaper,

05:40.200 --> 05:44.400
but also actually work instead of creating more problems.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.600
Drug prohibition led to a system that bulldozes human rights,

05:47.600 --> 05:52.000
costs vast sums of money, and creates a lot of human misery,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
all in pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.600
After 40 years of fighting, it's time to finally end the war on drugs

05:59.600 --> 06:02.400
and move on to something better.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.400
