0	5600	Over 40 years ago, US President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse public enemy number one,
5600	9600	starting an unprecedented global campaign, the War on Drugs.
9600	11800	Today, the numbers are in.
11800	16600	The War on Drugs is a huge failure with devastating unintended consequences.
16600	23400	It led to mass incarceration in the US, to corruption, political destabilization and violence in Latin America,
23400	28000	Asia and Africa, to systemic human rights abuses across the world.
28200	31600	It negatively affected the lives of millions of people.
31600	37800	All of this, while we waste billions of dollars every year, only to create and fuel powerful drug cartels,
37800	41600	while the goal of the War on Drugs seems less achievable than ever.
41600	43400	A world without drugs.
43400	44600	How could this happen?
44600	54400	The War on Drugs
54400	58800	The core strategy of the War on Drugs is no drugs, no problems.
58800	64200	So almost all of the efforts in the last few decades have been focused on eradicating the supply of drugs
64200	66600	and incarcerating drug traffickers.
66600	71600	But this ignores the most fundamental of market forces, supply and demand.
71800	77200	If you reduce the supply of anything without reducing the demand first, its price goes up.
77200	81000	This might lower sales for many products, but not for drugs.
81000	84000	The drugs market is not price-sensitive.
84000	86800	Drugs will be consumed no matter what they cost.
86800	94400	So the effect is to encourage production of more drugs and recruitment of more traffickers, which increases availability.
94400	97200	This is also known as the balloon effect.
97200	103600	Even if drug production or a major supply route is destroyed, the supply for the end user is not reduced.
103600	106600	A perfect example of this is crystal meth.
106600	113200	The US government tried to stop its production by strictly regulating the sale of chemicals used to manufacture the drug.
113200	115600	This forced big meth producers out of business,
115600	121200	but the unintended consequences were that thousands of small-scale operations started all over the country,
121200	126200	mostly in small towns and rural communities, using chemicals that weren't regulated.
126200	132800	In response to this, some US states wanted to reduce the supply of homegrown meth by regulating even more chemicals,
132800	135800	which reduced small-scale meth production drastically.
135800	138600	But the supply of meth still stayed the same.
138600	143600	Mexican drug cartels immediately took over and opened big production operations.
143600	148800	Their meth was even better than it was before, and they had loads of experience in smuggling.
148800	155800	So all these efforts made meth production more professional, the drug more potent, while supply wasn't reduced at all.
155800	158600	You can't win this war on the supply side.
158600	164400	Not only are drugs widely available, demand unbroken, and some drugs purer than in the past,
164400	170600	with a budget of around $30 billion, the US Drug Enforcement Agency has an efficiency rate of less than 1%
170600	175000	when it comes to stopping the flow of drugs into the US and inside the US.
175000	180200	For many minors around the world, it's as easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol.
180200	181600	But it doesn't stop here.
181600	184800	Prohibition may prevent a certain amount of people from taking drugs,
184800	189200	but in the process, it causes huge damage to society as a whole.
189200	194200	Many of the problems we associate with drug use are actually caused by the war against them.
194200	197200	For example, prohibition makes drugs stronger.
197200	202000	The more potent drugs you can store in as little space as possible, the more profit you'll make.
202000	207400	It was the same during alcohol prohibition, which led to an increased consumption of strong liquor over beer.
207400	211600	The prohibition of drugs also led to more violence and murders around the world.
211600	217200	Gangs and cartels have no access to the legal system to settle disputes, so they use violence.
217200	220400	This led to an ever-increasing spiral of brutality.
220400	227400	According to some estimates, the homicide rate in the US is 25 to 75% higher because of the war on drugs.
227400	236000	And in Mexico, a country on the front line, an estimated 164,000 have been murdered between 2007 and 2014.
236000	240600	More people than in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq in the same period combined.
240600	246600	But where the war on drugs might do the most damage to society is the incarceration of non-violent drug offenders.
246600	250800	For example, the United States, one of the driving forces of the war on drugs,
250800	256800	has 5% of the world's total population, but 25% of the world's prison population,
256800	260800	largely due to the harsh punishments and mandatory minimums.
260800	263600	Minorities suffer because of this especially.
263600	267200	African Americans make up 40% of all US prison inmates.
267200	270200	And while white kids are more likely to abuse drugs,
270200	274200	black kids are 10 times more likely to get arrested for drug offenses.
274200	277400	Okay, but is there actually something different we can do?
277400	279400	Is there a way out of this mess?
279400	284400	In the 1980s, Switzerland experienced a public health crisis related to heroin use.
284400	288800	HIV rates skyrocketed and street crime became a problem.
288800	292400	Swiss authorities tried a new strategy, harm reduction.
292600	297200	They opened free heroin maintenance centers where addicts would be treated and stabilized.
297200	301400	Here, people would be given free heroin of high quality, they would get clean needles,
301400	306800	and have access to safe injection rooms, showers, beds, and medical supervision.
306800	311400	Social workers helped them find housing and deal with other problems in their lives.
311400	314200	The results were a sharp drop in drug-related crime,
314200	317000	and two-thirds of the people in the centers got regular jobs
317000	321600	because now they could focus on getting better instead of financing their addiction.
321600	326400	Today, over 70% of all heroin addicts in Switzerland receive treatment.
326400	329200	HIV infections have dropped drastically.
329200	333200	Deaths from heroin overdoses have dropped by 50%.
333200	337600	And drug-related street sex work and crime has been reduced enormously.
337600	340200	So there are methods that are not only way cheaper,
340200	344400	but also actually work instead of creating more problems.
344400	347600	Drug prohibition led to a system that bulldozes human rights,
347600	352000	costs vast sums of money, and creates a lot of human misery,
352000	355000	all in pursuit of an unobtainable goal.
355000	359600	After 40 years of fighting, it's time to finally end the war on drugs
359600	362400	and move on to something better.
