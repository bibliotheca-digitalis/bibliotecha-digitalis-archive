00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Every living being needs to fight off other living beings that want to feast on them.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
So as multicellular life evolved over billions of years, it came up with ways to defend itself.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
Today, humans have a sophisticated defense network, like physical barriers, defense cells, and weapons factories.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
But one of the most important defenses of our body is largely unknown, the complement system.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
It evolved over 700 million years ago and is an army of over 30 different proteins that work together in a complex and elegant dance to stop intruders.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
All in all, about 15 quintillion of them are saturating every fluid in your body right now.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Guided by nothing but chemistry, these proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Many other parts of the immune system are just tools to activate the complement system.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
But it's also really dangerous.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood that could go off at any moment.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
So our cells use numerous mechanisms to prevent complement from accidentally attacking them.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay, what exactly does it do and what makes it so dangerous?

01:14.000 --> 01:27.000
In a nutshell, the complement system does three things.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
It cripples enemies, it activates the immune system, and it rips holes in things until they die.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
But how? After all, these are mindless proteins randomly drifting around without will or direction.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, this is actually part of the strategy.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
They do nothing, until they get activated and change their shape.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
In the world of proteins, your shape determines what you can and cannot do.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Because shape determines what you can interact with and in what way.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
For example, in your passive shape you might do nothing.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
In your active shape, however, you might, for example, change the shape of other proteins, activating them so they can activate others.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Mechanisms like this one can start cascades that spread very quickly.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
Imagine the complement proteins as being like millions of matches, very close together.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it, they ignite more, and suddenly you have a big fire.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
To show the actual mechanisms of the complement system is a tad complicated and overwhelming, so we'll simplify here.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
Now, let's imagine you cut yourself and a bunch of bacteria enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Our complement attack begins with C3.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
C3 is the first match, the initial spark that will start our fire.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And to do that, C3 needs to switch from passive to active.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
How this happens is complex, but let's just say it can happen randomly through other complement proteins that bind to enemies or through antibodies.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins, C3a and C3b, that are now activated.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
One of these parts, the C3b protein, is like a sika missile specialized in bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
It has a fraction of a second to find a victim or it will be neutralized by water molecules.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
If C3b does find a target, it anchors itself very tightly to its surface and doesn't let go.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
By doing so, the protein changes its shape again.

03:37.000 --> 03:47.000
In its new shape, it's now able to grab other proteins and start a small cascade, changing its shape multiple times, adding other complement proteins to itself.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
Finally, it transforms itself into a recruiting platform known as C3 Convertus.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins that start the whole cycle anew.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
An amplification loop begins.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Soon, thousands of proteins cover the bacteria.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
For the bacteria, this is very bad.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
It can cripple the bacteria and make them helpless or slow them down.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Imagine being covered by thousands of flies.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
But there's more.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Do you remember the other part of C3?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
The C3a protein?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
C3a is like a distress beacon.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle, screaming for attention.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Passive immune cells notice the C3a proteins and awaken from their slumber to follow the protein tracks to the site of infection.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
The more alarm proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
This way, complement guides reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
So far, the complement has slowed down the invaders and called for help.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Now, it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes,

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
which means cells that swallow you whole, trap you in a tiny prison, and then kill you with acid.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But to swallow an enemy, they need to grab it first,

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
which is not easy because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed and are sort of slippery.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
But now the complement that has anchored itself to the bacteria acts as a sort of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
But it gets even better.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Imagine being covered in flies again.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Now, imagine them turning into wasps.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Another cascade is about to begin.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
On the surface of the bacteria, the C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again and begins to recruit new proteins.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Together, they begin the construction of a bigger structure, a membrane attack complex.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
Piece by piece, new proteins shaped like long spears anchor themselves deep into the bacteria's membranes,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
until they rip a hole into them that can't be closed again.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Fluids rush into the bacteria and their insides spill out.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
They bleed to death.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
The remaining bacteria are maimed and distracted by the complement and quickly taken care of by the arriving immune cells.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
The invasion has been nipped in the bud before it had the opportunity to become dangerous.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
You probably didn't even notice it.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
But while bacteria are not happy about complement, the enemies it might be the most useful against are actually viruses.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Viruses have one problem.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
They need to travel from cell to cell.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
Outside of cells, they're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure chance.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Here, they're completely defenseless.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
And here, complement is able to intercept and cripple them so they become harmless and guide the immune system to devour them.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Without complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
But wait, if we have such an effective weapon, why do we ever get sick?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
For example, when the vaccinia virus infects a cell, it forces it to produce a protein that shuts complement activation down.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
This way, the virus creates safe zones around the cells it infects.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
When it kills them and tries to infect more, it has a higher chance of being successful.

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
Or some bacteria, for example, can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm and make themselves invisible.

07:17.000 --> 07:26.000
So the complement system, while being extremely important, is only one player in the complex and beautiful organization that is our immune system.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
A beautiful example of how many mindless things can do smart things together.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
This video was sponsored by you.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Without your direct support, this channel would not exist.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And it's hard to overstate how grateful we are for that.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
In 2019, an average Kurzgesagt video took at least 1200 hours to produce.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.000
We need months to research and write our scripts, clear them with experts, illustrate and animate every scene from scratch, and to compose original music.

08:00.000 --> 08:10.000
This is only possible through a combination of sponsorships, your support on Patreon, and selling merch, like this poster and postcards we made about the complement system.

08:10.000 --> 08:20.000
If you yourself want to support us, you can do so by watching, becoming a Patreon, and maybe getting a personal bird, or by getting one of our calendars or posters.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
The purpose of Kurzgesagt is to make the best videos we can, and to make science more approachable.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Thank you so much for making this possible.
