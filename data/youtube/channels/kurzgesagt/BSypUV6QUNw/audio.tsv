0	7000	Every living being needs to fight off other living beings that want to feast on them.
7000	13000	So as multicellular life evolved over billions of years, it came up with ways to defend itself.
13000	21000	Today, humans have a sophisticated defense network, like physical barriers, defense cells, and weapons factories.
21000	28000	But one of the most important defenses of our body is largely unknown, the complement system.
28000	38000	It evolved over 700 million years ago and is an army of over 30 different proteins that work together in a complex and elegant dance to stop intruders.
38000	44000	All in all, about 15 quintillion of them are saturating every fluid in your body right now.
44000	51000	Guided by nothing but chemistry, these proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders.
51000	56000	Many other parts of the immune system are just tools to activate the complement system.
56000	58000	But it's also really dangerous.
58000	63000	Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood that could go off at any moment.
63000	70000	So our cells use numerous mechanisms to prevent complement from accidentally attacking them.
70000	74000	Okay, what exactly does it do and what makes it so dangerous?
74000	87000	In a nutshell, the complement system does three things.
87000	93000	It cripples enemies, it activates the immune system, and it rips holes in things until they die.
93000	100000	But how? After all, these are mindless proteins randomly drifting around without will or direction.
101000	104000	Well, this is actually part of the strategy.
104000	108000	Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode.
108000	112000	They do nothing, until they get activated and change their shape.
112000	117000	In the world of proteins, your shape determines what you can and cannot do.
117000	122000	Because shape determines what you can interact with and in what way.
122000	126000	For example, in your passive shape you might do nothing.
126000	134000	In your active shape, however, you might, for example, change the shape of other proteins, activating them so they can activate others.
134000	139000	Mechanisms like this one can start cascades that spread very quickly.
139000	145000	Imagine the complement proteins as being like millions of matches, very close together.
145000	152000	Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it, they ignite more, and suddenly you have a big fire.
152000	160000	To show the actual mechanisms of the complement system is a tad complicated and overwhelming, so we'll simplify here.
160000	166000	Now, let's imagine you cut yourself and a bunch of bacteria enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue.
166000	169000	Our complement attack begins with C3.
169000	174000	C3 is the first match, the initial spark that will start our fire.
174000	178000	And to do that, C3 needs to switch from passive to active.
178000	187000	How this happens is complex, but let's just say it can happen randomly through other complement proteins that bind to enemies or through antibodies.
187000	195000	All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins, C3a and C3b, that are now activated.
195000	202000	One of these parts, the C3b protein, is like a sika missile specialized in bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
202000	207000	It has a fraction of a second to find a victim or it will be neutralized by water molecules.
207000	214000	If C3b does find a target, it anchors itself very tightly to its surface and doesn't let go.
214000	217000	By doing so, the protein changes its shape again.
217000	227000	In its new shape, it's now able to grab other proteins and start a small cascade, changing its shape multiple times, adding other complement proteins to itself.
227000	233000	Finally, it transforms itself into a recruiting platform known as C3 Convertus.
233000	239000	This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins that start the whole cycle anew.
239000	242000	An amplification loop begins.
242000	245000	Soon, thousands of proteins cover the bacteria.
245000	248000	For the bacteria, this is very bad.
248000	252000	It can cripple the bacteria and make them helpless or slow them down.
252000	255000	Imagine being covered by thousands of flies.
255000	256000	But there's more.
256000	258000	Do you remember the other part of C3?
258000	260000	The C3a protein?
260000	263000	C3a is like a distress beacon.
263000	267000	Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle, screaming for attention.
267000	275000	Passive immune cells notice the C3a proteins and awaken from their slumber to follow the protein tracks to the site of infection.
275000	279000	The more alarm proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get.
279000	285000	This way, complement guides reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most.
285000	289000	So far, the complement has slowed down the invaders and called for help.
289000	293000	Now, it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy.
293000	297000	The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes,
297000	303000	which means cells that swallow you whole, trap you in a tiny prison, and then kill you with acid.
303000	306000	But to swallow an enemy, they need to grab it first,
306000	311000	which is not easy because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed and are sort of slippery.
311000	319000	But now the complement that has anchored itself to the bacteria acts as a sort of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims.
319000	321000	But it gets even better.
321000	323000	Imagine being covered in flies again.
323000	326000	Now, imagine them turning into wasps.
326000	329000	Another cascade is about to begin.
329000	336000	On the surface of the bacteria, the C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again and begins to recruit new proteins.
336000	341000	Together, they begin the construction of a bigger structure, a membrane attack complex.
341000	348000	Piece by piece, new proteins shaped like long spears anchor themselves deep into the bacteria's membranes,
348000	351000	until they rip a hole into them that can't be closed again.
351000	355000	Fluids rush into the bacteria and their insides spill out.
355000	357000	They bleed to death.
357000	364000	The remaining bacteria are maimed and distracted by the complement and quickly taken care of by the arriving immune cells.
364000	369000	The invasion has been nipped in the bud before it had the opportunity to become dangerous.
369000	371000	You probably didn't even notice it.
371000	379000	But while bacteria are not happy about complement, the enemies it might be the most useful against are actually viruses.
379000	381000	Viruses have one problem.
381000	383000	They need to travel from cell to cell.
383000	389000	Outside of cells, they're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure chance.
389000	392000	Here, they're completely defenseless.
392000	400000	And here, complement is able to intercept and cripple them so they become harmless and guide the immune system to devour them.
400000	404000	Without complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly.
404000	409000	But wait, if we have such an effective weapon, why do we ever get sick?
409000	412000	The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt.
412000	419000	For example, when the vaccinia virus infects a cell, it forces it to produce a protein that shuts complement activation down.
419000	424000	This way, the virus creates safe zones around the cells it infects.
424000	429000	When it kills them and tries to infect more, it has a higher chance of being successful.
429000	437000	Or some bacteria, for example, can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm and make themselves invisible.
437000	446000	So the complement system, while being extremely important, is only one player in the complex and beautiful organization that is our immune system.
446000	452000	A beautiful example of how many mindless things can do smart things together.

461000	464000	And it's hard to overstate how grateful we are for that.
464000	470000	In 2019, an average Kurzgesagt video took at least 1200 hours to produce.
471000	480000	We need months to research and write our scripts, clear them with experts, illustrate and animate every scene from scratch, and to compose original music.
480000	490000	This is only possible through a combination of sponsorships, your support on Patreon, and selling merch, like this poster and postcards we made about the complement system.
490000	500000	If you yourself want to support us, you can do so by watching, becoming a Patreon, and maybe getting a personal bird, or by getting one of our calendars or posters.
500000	505000	The purpose of Kurzgesagt is to make the best videos we can, and to make science more approachable.
505000	508000	Thank you so much for making this possible.
