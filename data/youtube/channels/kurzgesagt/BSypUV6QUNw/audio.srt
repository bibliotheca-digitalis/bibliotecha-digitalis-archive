1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Every living being needs to fight off other living beings that want to feast on them.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So as multicellular life evolved over billions of years, it came up with ways to defend itself.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, humans have a sophisticated defense network, like physical barriers, defense cells, and weapons factories.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But one of the most important defenses of our body is largely unknown, the complement system.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It evolved over 700 million years ago and is an army of over 30 different proteins that work together in a complex and elegant dance to stop intruders.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
All in all, about 15 quintillion of them are saturating every fluid in your body right now.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Guided by nothing but chemistry, these proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Many other parts of the immune system are just tools to activate the complement system.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But it's also really dangerous.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood that could go off at any moment.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So our cells use numerous mechanisms to prevent complement from accidentally attacking them.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, what exactly does it do and what makes it so dangerous?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In a nutshell, the complement system does three things.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It cripples enemies, it activates the immune system, and it rips holes in things until they die.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But how? After all, these are mindless proteins randomly drifting around without will or direction.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, this is actually part of the strategy.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They do nothing, until they get activated and change their shape.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the world of proteins, your shape determines what you can and cannot do.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because shape determines what you can interact with and in what way.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
For example, in your passive shape you might do nothing.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In your active shape, however, you might, for example, change the shape of other proteins, activating them so they can activate others.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Mechanisms like this one can start cascades that spread very quickly.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Imagine the complement proteins as being like millions of matches, very close together.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it, they ignite more, and suddenly you have a big fire.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To show the actual mechanisms of the complement system is a tad complicated and overwhelming, so we'll simplify here.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now, let's imagine you cut yourself and a bunch of bacteria enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Our complement attack begins with C3.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
C3 is the first match, the initial spark that will start our fire.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And to do that, C3 needs to switch from passive to active.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How this happens is complex, but let's just say it can happen randomly through other complement proteins that bind to enemies or through antibodies.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins, C3a and C3b, that are now activated.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
One of these parts, the C3b protein, is like a sika missile specialized in bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It has a fraction of a second to find a victim or it will be neutralized by water molecules.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If C3b does find a target, it anchors itself very tightly to its surface and doesn't let go.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
By doing so, the protein changes its shape again.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In its new shape, it's now able to grab other proteins and start a small cascade, changing its shape multiple times, adding other complement proteins to itself.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Finally, it transforms itself into a recruiting platform known as C3 Convertus.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins that start the whole cycle anew.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
An amplification loop begins.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Soon, thousands of proteins cover the bacteria.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
For the bacteria, this is very bad.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It can cripple the bacteria and make them helpless or slow them down.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Imagine being covered by thousands of flies.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But there's more.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you remember the other part of C3?

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The C3a protein?

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
C3a is like a distress beacon.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle, screaming for attention.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Passive immune cells notice the C3a proteins and awaken from their slumber to follow the protein tracks to the site of infection.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The more alarm proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This way, complement guides reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So far, the complement has slowed down the invaders and called for help.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now, it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes,

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
which means cells that swallow you whole, trap you in a tiny prison, and then kill you with acid.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But to swallow an enemy, they need to grab it first,

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which is not easy because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed and are sort of slippery.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But now the complement that has anchored itself to the bacteria acts as a sort of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But it gets even better.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Imagine being covered in flies again.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now, imagine them turning into wasps.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Another cascade is about to begin.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
On the surface of the bacteria, the C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again and begins to recruit new proteins.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Together, they begin the construction of a bigger structure, a membrane attack complex.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Piece by piece, new proteins shaped like long spears anchor themselves deep into the bacteria's membranes,

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
until they rip a hole into them that can't be closed again.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Fluids rush into the bacteria and their insides spill out.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They bleed to death.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The remaining bacteria are maimed and distracted by the complement and quickly taken care of by the arriving immune cells.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The invasion has been nipped in the bud before it had the opportunity to become dangerous.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You probably didn't even notice it.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But while bacteria are not happy about complement, the enemies it might be the most useful against are actually viruses.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Viruses have one problem.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They need to travel from cell to cell.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Outside of cells, they're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure chance.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here, they're completely defenseless.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And here, complement is able to intercept and cripple them so they become harmless and guide the immune system to devour them.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Without complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly.

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But wait, if we have such an effective weapon, why do we ever get sick?

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt.

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
For example, when the vaccinia virus infects a cell, it forces it to produce a protein that shuts complement activation down.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This way, the virus creates safe zones around the cells it infects.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When it kills them and tries to infect more, it has a higher chance of being successful.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Or some bacteria, for example, can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm and make themselves invisible.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So the complement system, while being extremely important, is only one player in the complex and beautiful organization that is our immune system.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A beautiful example of how many mindless things can do smart things together.

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This video was sponsored by you.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Without your direct support, this channel would not exist.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And it's hard to overstate how grateful we are for that.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In 2019, an average Kurzgesagt video took at least 1200 hours to produce.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We need months to research and write our scripts, clear them with experts, illustrate and animate every scene from scratch, and to compose original music.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is only possible through a combination of sponsorships, your support on Patreon, and selling merch, like this poster and postcards we made about the complement system.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you yourself want to support us, you can do so by watching, becoming a Patreon, and maybe getting a personal bird, or by getting one of our calendars or posters.

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The purpose of Kurzgesagt is to make the best videos we can, and to make science more approachable.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you so much for making this possible.
