1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,280
and they're wildly weird and complicated.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,760
What would happen if you fell inside one, and what are they really?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
First, we need to talk about space and time.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
Space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,880
But space isn't a fixed stage, and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
In short, they're relative.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,120
Matter bends space, and bent space tells matter how to move.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Put some stars and planets on the stage, and it sacks underneath them.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
That misshapen stage, with all its little warps and dips, gives us gravity.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,120
Black holes do not just bend the stage, they're like trapdoors, places with so much mass

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,520
that the universe formed a no-go zone where the rules change.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Most black holes form when very massive stars die.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
We explained this process in detail in our neutron star video.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,840
All you need to know now is that in the final moments of really massive stars,

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,360
their insides implode at nearly a quarter of the speed of light.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,360
This packs so much mass so close together,

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,160
creating something so dense that it sort of breaks the stage of the universe.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
A black hole with ten times the mass of the sun would be barely 60 kilometers across.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,120
If you look directly at a black hole, it looks like nothing.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,040
The space under their control is blocked by an invisible, one-way border called the event horizon.

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,120
The event horizon forms a shell around a region of space

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,960
that once entered is shielded from the rest of the universe forever.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,200
Because the black hole trapdoor deforms space so much, not even light can escape it.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,360
And with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside,

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
it's impossible to tell what it really looks like.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
We can still observe black holes because of their effect on matter.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
Things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the sun or a planet.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
Many black holes have disks of matter orbiting outside the event horizon.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
This matter can become incredibly hot,

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light,

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,080
and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion degrees,

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
making the space around these black holes ironically incredibly bright.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,760
What would happen if you were to try to get close or even inside a black hole?

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
First of all, you'd see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe.

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
Matter isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole,

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
If you hover just outside the event horizon, at the photon sphere,

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
in any direction, you just see yourself.

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,160
Straight ahead would be the back of your own head,

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes.

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
Gravity also alters the passage of time itself.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,320
The stronger the gravity, the slower time passes.

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,680
While you watch the universe above you speed up,

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
those far away will watch you in slow motion.

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,520
If you chose to fly away from the black hole,

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,120
you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe,

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,400
a freakish one-way time travel trip to the future where your loved ones are long dead.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,640
But getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
A painful death by spaghettification awaits you.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head,

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
they feel a stronger pull of gravity, enough to pull you apart.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,680
As you descend, it gets worse, the pulling gets stronger,

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,320
your body squeezed thinner and straighter,

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,360
until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma,

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,320
gobbled up in one final slurp, never to be seen again.

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
since they have much smaller radii.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,320
If you go to the center of a galaxy and find a supermassive black hole,

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,280
you might be able to experience crossing the event horizon.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,920
As you approach the event horizon,

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,560
a distant observer would think they never saw you enter it, seeing you stop and fade.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,240
The last light you emit, trickling up and out, away from the event horizon.

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Meanwhile, from your perspective, the void of the black hole rises up to meet you,

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
as light from fewer directions can reach you.

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
The blackness envelops you until your only view of the universe you left

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
is a tiny spot of light.

68
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,760
Here, inside the event horizon, space and time are so horribly broken,

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,080
that real time travel is possible, so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
If anything could escape, it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
and issues that break the universe.

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
As scary as the event horizon is, it keeps us safe from that drama.

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter,

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,520
as now there's only the certainty of crushing death in your near future.

75
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,480
Inside the event horizon, space-time itself is so bent and warped,

76
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,240
that whatever direction you move here, every forward you go,

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
leads only towards the center of the black hole.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
Trying to go in any direction only brings you to the center faster.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
To survive the longest, you must do nothing.

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,640
In the center of the black hole, we find the singularity,

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,320
a single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the event horizon,

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
all crushed to a point infinitely small.

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
There is no memory of the things that made it,

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
as stuff disappears down the black hole trapdoor forever.

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
The singularity makes all things equal.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
This actually breaks the universe in really cool ways.

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
We've made a video about this problem if you want to learn more.

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,480
But in a nutshell, everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter,

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,400
concentrated at the singularity.

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,320
This lack of a memory of its past means that a black hole has only three properties,

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,120
its mass, spin, and electric charge.

92
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Everything else is lost.

93
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,320
They're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect.

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,120
This actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same.

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,680
Sure, their mass is different, and some spin faster than others,

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,760
but if we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics museum,

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
they'd be identical, like electrons.

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,040
But just like fundamental particles,

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,520
the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper,

100
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
rather than an accurate representation of reality.

101
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Our current theories about the universe,

102
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
namely general relativity, are just not able to describe or explain them.

103
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,600
The curvature of space becomes infinite,

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,440
density becomes infinite,

105
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,760
and our rules just don't make sense.

106
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
The singularity has no surface or size,

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
something like a divide-by-zero error in the universe.

108
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,760
So, singularities might not even exist,

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,840
or be completely different things.

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
But this is all we know right now,

111
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,760
from the best prediction we have,

112
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,000
from our best current theory of space-time.

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
Also, basically everything you've ever heard about black holes,

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
even in this video,

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,000
is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning,

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,920
because their maths is so much easier.

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
But since black holes were born from dying stars

118
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,920
that were spinning extremely quickly in their final moments,

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,200
as far as we know,

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,160
all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now.

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
At incredible speeds too,

122
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,360
up to 90% of the speed of light.

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,040
This means that in reality,

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,640
black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for.

125
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,680
The singularities of rotating black holes are even wilder.

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,480
The rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ringularity.

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,600
This rotation is so powerful,

128
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,520
that space itself is dragged along.

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
This creates another region around spinning black holes,

130
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
called the ergosphere,

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
where it's impossible to stay still,

132
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
no matter how hard you try.

133
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
Like a rushing whirlpool of space-time,

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
the tide is irresistible,

135
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,400
and the black hole makes you orbit it whether you want to or not.

136
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay, so what will happen to black holes

137
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
as the universe ages and dies around them?

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Again, we don't know,

139
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,840
but we have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics.

140
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,240
In quantum field theory,

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,600
the vacuum of space is boiling with quantum fluctuations.

142
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,360
These fluctuations are creating matter and antimatter pairs of particles from nothing,

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
which only exist for a very short time before annihilating.

144
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,400
When this happens near the event horizon of a black hole,

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,560
one of these particles can fall in,

146
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,000
stopping them from annihilating.

147
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
The escaping particle is Hawking radiation.

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
Ultimately, the mass of this particle must come from the black hole,

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,200
so over eons, black holes will shrink and radiate away.

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole,

151
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
it's new stuff, stealing mass from it.

152
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
As the black hole shrinks,

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,560
the Hawking radiation gets stronger,

154
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
faster and faster,

155
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,320
until what's left eventually evaporates

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
in a flash of high-energy radiation like a nuclear bomb.

157
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,360
And then, nothing.

158
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
But that won't happen for a long, long time.

159
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,000
A black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10 to the power of 67 years.

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,360
Which means that it would take 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,200
to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.

162
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,280
But most black holes are way more massive than our sun.

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
The most massive supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies

164
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,720
have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years.

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
How long is that?

166
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
Imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe.

167
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,160
Every 10 billion years, one single grain of sand falls to the bottom.

168
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,840
If we waited for all the sand to fall down,

169
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,840
not even 1% of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed.

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,280
There is no good concept to help our brains grasp these timescales.

171
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
Will we ever truly understand black holes?

172
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Really know what's going on inside them?

173
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
No one knows.

174
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
We can only see their outsides,

175
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,280
and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong.

176
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,000
But it's okay to not know everything.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
It just means there's still work to be done.

178
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,520
It means there are still mysteries to solve,

179
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,960
and big ideas to think about, which is why humans do science.

180
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,040
In the end, we can at least be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them,

181
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
before the last one melts away.

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
If you want to continue thinking about black holes,

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
you can do so by getting one of the many black hole-related things

184
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
the Kurzgesagt team has made with love.

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,040
Like our black hole infographic poster that teaches you all the black hole basics.

186
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Or our choose your own black hole adventure poster

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,960
that takes you on a spectacular ride and might leave you in need of a cuddle,

188
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,240
in which case we've made a black hole and white hole plushie.

189
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
And if that's still not enough, we've also just released super comfy space socks,

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
very shiny space pins, a new tote bag and pouch set,

191
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
and we have many other great space-related products

192
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
that are all designed with love and care by us here at Kurzgesagt.

193
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,960

196
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,560
