00:00.800 --> 00:04.800
Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe,

00:04.800 --> 00:07.280
and they're wildly weird and complicated.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.760
What would happen if you fell inside one, and what are they really?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.960
First, we need to talk about space and time.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.240
Space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.880
But space isn't a fixed stage, and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.200
In short, they're relative.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.120
Matter bends space, and bent space tells matter how to move.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.760
Put some stars and planets on the stage, and it sacks underneath them.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.360
That misshapen stage, with all its little warps and dips, gives us gravity.

00:54.320 --> 01:01.120
Black holes do not just bend the stage, they're like trapdoors, places with so much mass

01:01.120 --> 01:05.520
that the universe formed a no-go zone where the rules change.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.880
Most black holes form when very massive stars die.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.880
We explained this process in detail in our neutron star video.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.840
All you need to know now is that in the final moments of really massive stars,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.360
their insides implode at nearly a quarter of the speed of light.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.360
This packs so much mass so close together,

01:27.360 --> 01:32.160
creating something so dense that it sort of breaks the stage of the universe.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.840
A black hole with ten times the mass of the sun would be barely 60 kilometers across.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.120
If you look directly at a black hole, it looks like nothing.

01:43.120 --> 01:49.040
The space under their control is blocked by an invisible, one-way border called the event horizon.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.120
The event horizon forms a shell around a region of space

01:53.120 --> 01:56.960
that once entered is shielded from the rest of the universe forever.

01:57.840 --> 02:03.200
Because the black hole trapdoor deforms space so much, not even light can escape it.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.360
And with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.520
it's impossible to tell what it really looks like.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.920
We can still observe black holes because of their effect on matter.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.720
Things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the sun or a planet.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.680
Many black holes have disks of matter orbiting outside the event horizon.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.800
This matter can become incredibly hot,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.720
as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light,

02:30.720 --> 02:36.080
and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion degrees,

02:36.080 --> 02:40.640
making the space around these black holes ironically incredibly bright.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.760
What would happen if you were to try to get close or even inside a black hole?

02:46.400 --> 02:50.080
First of all, you'd see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.760
Matter isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole,

02:53.760 --> 02:57.200
gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.920
If you hover just outside the event horizon, at the photon sphere,

03:01.920 --> 03:04.720
in any direction, you just see yourself.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.160
Straight ahead would be the back of your own head,

03:08.160 --> 03:11.360
as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.040
Gravity also alters the passage of time itself.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.320
The stronger the gravity, the slower time passes.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.680
While you watch the universe above you speed up,

03:21.680 --> 03:24.240
those far away will watch you in slow motion.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.520
If you chose to fly away from the black hole,

03:27.520 --> 03:31.120
you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe,

03:31.120 --> 03:36.400
a freakish one-way time travel trip to the future where your loved ones are long dead.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.640
But getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.000
A painful death by spaghettification awaits you.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.000
Because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.440
they feel a stronger pull of gravity, enough to pull you apart.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.680
As you descend, it gets worse, the pulling gets stronger,

03:55.680 --> 03:58.320
your body squeezed thinner and straighter,

03:58.320 --> 04:01.360
until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma,

04:01.360 --> 04:04.320
gobbled up in one final slurp, never to be seen again.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.000
Spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.080
since they have much smaller radii.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.320
If you go to the center of a galaxy and find a supermassive black hole,

04:14.320 --> 04:17.280
you might be able to experience crossing the event horizon.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.920
As you approach the event horizon,

04:19.920 --> 04:24.560
a distant observer would think they never saw you enter it, seeing you stop and fade.

04:25.360 --> 04:30.240
The last light you emit, trickling up and out, away from the event horizon.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.040
Meanwhile, from your perspective, the void of the black hole rises up to meet you,

04:35.040 --> 04:37.360
as light from fewer directions can reach you.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.880
The blackness envelops you until your only view of the universe you left

04:42.960 --> 04:44.400
is a tiny spot of light.

04:45.120 --> 04:49.760
Here, inside the event horizon, space and time are so horribly broken,

04:49.760 --> 04:54.080
that real time travel is possible, so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.960
If anything could escape, it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes

04:58.960 --> 05:00.880
and issues that break the universe.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.680
As scary as the event horizon is, it keeps us safe from that drama.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.760
Whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter,

05:09.760 --> 05:13.520
as now there's only the certainty of crushing death in your near future.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.480
Inside the event horizon, space-time itself is so bent and warped,

05:18.480 --> 05:22.240
that whatever direction you move here, every forward you go,

05:22.240 --> 05:24.720
leads only towards the center of the black hole.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.280
Trying to go in any direction only brings you to the center faster.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.400
To survive the longest, you must do nothing.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.640
In the center of the black hole, we find the singularity,

05:36.640 --> 05:40.320
a single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the event horizon,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.560
all crushed to a point infinitely small.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.080
There is no memory of the things that made it,

05:46.080 --> 05:49.280
as stuff disappears down the black hole trapdoor forever.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.560
The singularity makes all things equal.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.240
This actually breaks the universe in really cool ways.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.440
We've made a video about this problem if you want to learn more.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.480
But in a nutshell, everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter,

06:04.480 --> 06:06.400
concentrated at the singularity.

06:07.520 --> 06:12.320
This lack of a memory of its past means that a black hole has only three properties,

06:12.320 --> 06:15.120
its mass, spin, and electric charge.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.040
Everything else is lost.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.320
They're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.120
This actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.680
Sure, their mass is different, and some spin faster than others,

06:29.680 --> 06:33.760
but if we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics museum,

06:33.760 --> 06:36.000
they'd be identical, like electrons.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.040
But just like fundamental particles,

06:39.040 --> 06:43.520
the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper,

06:43.520 --> 06:46.160
rather than an accurate representation of reality.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.280
Our current theories about the universe,

06:49.280 --> 06:53.440
namely general relativity, are just not able to describe or explain them.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.600
The curvature of space becomes infinite,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.440
density becomes infinite,

06:59.440 --> 07:01.760
and our rules just don't make sense.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.520
The singularity has no surface or size,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.480
something like a divide-by-zero error in the universe.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.760
So, singularities might not even exist,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.840
or be completely different things.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.080
But this is all we know right now,

07:16.080 --> 07:17.760
from the best prediction we have,

07:17.760 --> 07:20.000
from our best current theory of space-time.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.000
Also, basically everything you've ever heard about black holes,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.200
even in this video,

07:25.200 --> 07:28.000
is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.920
because their maths is so much easier.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.440
But since black holes were born from dying stars

07:33.440 --> 07:35.920
that were spinning extremely quickly in their final moments,

07:35.920 --> 07:37.200
as far as we know,

07:37.200 --> 07:40.160
all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.560
At incredible speeds too,

07:42.560 --> 07:45.360
up to 90% of the speed of light.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.040
This means that in reality,

07:47.040 --> 07:50.640
black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.680
The singularities of rotating black holes are even wilder.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.480
The rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ringularity.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.600
This rotation is so powerful,

08:03.600 --> 08:05.520
that space itself is dragged along.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.120
This creates another region around spinning black holes,

08:09.120 --> 08:10.800
called the ergosphere,

08:10.800 --> 08:12.560
where it's impossible to stay still,

08:12.560 --> 08:13.920
no matter how hard you try.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.280
Like a rushing whirlpool of space-time,

08:17.280 --> 08:19.120
the tide is irresistible,

08:19.120 --> 08:22.400
and the black hole makes you orbit it whether you want to or not.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.560
Okay, so what will happen to black holes

08:26.560 --> 08:28.960
as the universe ages and dies around them?

08:29.600 --> 08:30.640
Again, we don't know,

08:30.640 --> 08:33.840
but we have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.240
In quantum field theory,

08:38.240 --> 08:41.600
the vacuum of space is boiling with quantum fluctuations.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.360
These fluctuations are creating matter and antimatter pairs of particles from nothing,

08:47.360 --> 08:50.720
which only exist for a very short time before annihilating.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.400
When this happens near the event horizon of a black hole,

08:54.400 --> 08:56.560
one of these particles can fall in,

08:56.560 --> 08:58.000
stopping them from annihilating.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.360
The escaping particle is Hawking radiation.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.760
Ultimately, the mass of this particle must come from the black hole,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.200
so over eons, black holes will shrink and radiate away.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.760
Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole,

09:13.760 --> 09:16.080
it's new stuff, stealing mass from it.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.400
As the black hole shrinks,

09:18.400 --> 09:20.560
the Hawking radiation gets stronger,

09:20.560 --> 09:21.920
faster and faster,

09:21.920 --> 09:24.320
until what's left eventually evaporates

09:24.320 --> 09:27.200
in a flash of high-energy radiation like a nuclear bomb.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.360
And then, nothing.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.080
But that won't happen for a long, long time.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.000
A black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10 to the power of 67 years.

09:38.640 --> 09:45.360
Which means that it would take 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years

09:45.360 --> 09:51.200
to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.280
But most black holes are way more massive than our sun.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.680
The most massive supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies

09:59.680 --> 10:02.720
have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.480
How long is that?

10:05.680 --> 10:11.120
Imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.160
Every 10 billion years, one single grain of sand falls to the bottom.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.840
If we waited for all the sand to fall down,

10:19.840 --> 10:23.840
not even 1% of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.280
There is no good concept to help our brains grasp these timescales.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.200
Will we ever truly understand black holes?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.840
Really know what's going on inside them?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.280
No one knows.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.240
We can only see their outsides,

10:40.240 --> 10:43.280
and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.000
But it's okay to not know everything.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.160
It just means there's still work to be done.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.520
It means there are still mysteries to solve,

10:51.520 --> 10:54.960
and big ideas to think about, which is why humans do science.

10:55.840 --> 11:01.040
In the end, we can at least be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them,

11:01.040 --> 11:03.600
before the last one melts away.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.360
If you want to continue thinking about black holes,

11:09.360 --> 11:12.800
you can do so by getting one of the many black hole-related things

11:12.800 --> 11:15.120
