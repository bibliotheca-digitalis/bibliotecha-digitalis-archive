800	4800	Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe,
4800	7280	and they're wildly weird and complicated.
8080	11760	What would happen if you fell inside one, and what are they really?
20000	22960	First, we need to talk about space and time.
23600	28240	Space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds.
29200	34880	But space isn't a fixed stage, and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere.
35440	37200	In short, they're relative.
38080	43120	Matter bends space, and bent space tells matter how to move.
43840	47760	Put some stars and planets on the stage, and it sacks underneath them.
48480	53360	That misshapen stage, with all its little warps and dips, gives us gravity.
54320	61120	Black holes do not just bend the stage, they're like trapdoors, places with so much mass
61120	65520	that the universe formed a no-go zone where the rules change.
66720	70880	Most black holes form when very massive stars die.
70880	74880	We explained this process in detail in our neutron star video.
75760	79840	All you need to know now is that in the final moments of really massive stars,
79840	83360	their insides implode at nearly a quarter of the speed of light.
84320	87360	This packs so much mass so close together,
87360	92160	creating something so dense that it sort of breaks the stage of the universe.
92880	97840	A black hole with ten times the mass of the sun would be barely 60 kilometers across.
98800	103120	If you look directly at a black hole, it looks like nothing.
103120	109040	The space under their control is blocked by an invisible, one-way border called the event horizon.
109920	113120	The event horizon forms a shell around a region of space
113120	116960	that once entered is shielded from the rest of the universe forever.
117840	123200	Because the black hole trapdoor deforms space so much, not even light can escape it.
123760	127360	And with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside,
127360	129520	it's impossible to tell what it really looks like.
130560	133920	We can still observe black holes because of their effect on matter.
134480	138720	Things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the sun or a planet.
139440	143680	Many black holes have disks of matter orbiting outside the event horizon.
144400	146800	This matter can become incredibly hot,
146800	150720	as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light,
150720	156080	and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion degrees,
156080	160640	making the space around these black holes ironically incredibly bright.
161600	165760	What would happen if you were to try to get close or even inside a black hole?
166400	170080	First of all, you'd see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe.
171120	173760	Matter isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole,
173760	177200	gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too.
178000	181920	If you hover just outside the event horizon, at the photon sphere,
181920	184720	in any direction, you just see yourself.
185760	188160	Straight ahead would be the back of your own head,
188160	191360	as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes.
192080	195040	Gravity also alters the passage of time itself.
195600	198320	The stronger the gravity, the slower time passes.
198960	201680	While you watch the universe above you speed up,
201680	204240	those far away will watch you in slow motion.
205120	207520	If you chose to fly away from the black hole,
207520	211120	you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe,
211120	216400	a freakish one-way time travel trip to the future where your loved ones are long dead.
217600	220640	But getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous.
221200	224000	A painful death by spaghettification awaits you.
225040	228000	Because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head,
228000	231440	they feel a stronger pull of gravity, enough to pull you apart.
232320	235680	As you descend, it gets worse, the pulling gets stronger,
235680	238320	your body squeezed thinner and straighter,
238320	241360	until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma,
241360	244320	gobbled up in one final slurp, never to be seen again.
245040	248000	Spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes,
248000	250080	since they have much smaller radii.
250080	254320	If you go to the center of a galaxy and find a supermassive black hole,
254320	257280	you might be able to experience crossing the event horizon.
258000	259920	As you approach the event horizon,
259920	264560	a distant observer would think they never saw you enter it, seeing you stop and fade.
265360	270240	The last light you emit, trickling up and out, away from the event horizon.
270800	275040	Meanwhile, from your perspective, the void of the black hole rises up to meet you,
275040	277360	as light from fewer directions can reach you.
278160	282880	The blackness envelops you until your only view of the universe you left
282960	284400	is a tiny spot of light.
285120	289760	Here, inside the event horizon, space and time are so horribly broken,
289760	294080	that real time travel is possible, so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out.
294960	298960	If anything could escape, it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes
298960	300880	and issues that break the universe.
301600	305680	As scary as the event horizon is, it keeps us safe from that drama.
306720	309760	Whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter,
309760	313520	as now there's only the certainty of crushing death in your near future.
314320	318480	Inside the event horizon, space-time itself is so bent and warped,
318480	322240	that whatever direction you move here, every forward you go,
322240	324720	leads only towards the center of the black hole.
325360	329280	Trying to go in any direction only brings you to the center faster.
329280	332400	To survive the longest, you must do nothing.
333200	336640	In the center of the black hole, we find the singularity,
336640	340320	a single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the event horizon,
340320	342560	all crushed to a point infinitely small.
343440	346080	There is no memory of the things that made it,
346080	349280	as stuff disappears down the black hole trapdoor forever.
350400	352560	The singularity makes all things equal.
353120	356240	This actually breaks the universe in really cool ways.
356800	359440	We've made a video about this problem if you want to learn more.
360240	364480	But in a nutshell, everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter,
364480	366400	concentrated at the singularity.
367520	372320	This lack of a memory of its past means that a black hole has only three properties,
372320	375120	its mass, spin, and electric charge.
375680	377040	Everything else is lost.
377760	380320	They're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect.
381040	385120	This actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same.
385760	389680	Sure, their mass is different, and some spin faster than others,
389680	393760	but if we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics museum,
393760	396000	they'd be identical, like electrons.
396880	399040	But just like fundamental particles,
399040	403520	the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper,
403520	406160	rather than an accurate representation of reality.
407280	409280	Our current theories about the universe,
409280	413440	namely general relativity, are just not able to describe or explain them.
414800	417600	The curvature of space becomes infinite,
417600	419440	density becomes infinite,
419440	421760	and our rules just don't make sense.
422400	425520	The singularity has no surface or size,
425520	428480	something like a divide-by-zero error in the universe.
429200	431760	So, singularities might not even exist,
431760	433840	or be completely different things.
434400	436080	But this is all we know right now,
436080	437760	from the best prediction we have,
437760	440000	from our best current theory of space-time.
440880	444000	Also, basically everything you've ever heard about black holes,
444000	445200	even in this video,
445200	448000	is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning,
448000	449920	because their maths is so much easier.
450960	453440	But since black holes were born from dying stars
453440	455920	that were spinning extremely quickly in their final moments,
455920	457200	as far as we know,
457200	460160	all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now.
460880	462560	At incredible speeds too,
462560	465360	up to 90% of the speed of light.
465360	467040	This means that in reality,
467040	470640	black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for.
471920	475680	The singularities of rotating black holes are even wilder.
476320	480480	The rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ringularity.
481440	483600	This rotation is so powerful,
483600	485520	that space itself is dragged along.
486240	489120	This creates another region around spinning black holes,
489120	490800	called the ergosphere,
490800	492560	where it's impossible to stay still,
492560	493920	no matter how hard you try.
494720	497280	Like a rushing whirlpool of space-time,
497280	499120	the tide is irresistible,
499120	502400	and the black hole makes you orbit it whether you want to or not.
503840	506560	Okay, so what will happen to black holes
506560	508960	as the universe ages and dies around them?
509600	510640	Again, we don't know,
510640	513840	but we have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics.
516800	518240	In quantum field theory,
518240	521600	the vacuum of space is boiling with quantum fluctuations.
522480	527360	These fluctuations are creating matter and antimatter pairs of particles from nothing,
527360	530720	which only exist for a very short time before annihilating.
531520	534400	When this happens near the event horizon of a black hole,
534400	536560	one of these particles can fall in,
536560	538000	stopping them from annihilating.
538720	541360	The escaping particle is Hawking radiation.
542160	545760	Ultimately, the mass of this particle must come from the black hole,
545760	549200	so over eons, black holes will shrink and radiate away.
550320	553760	Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole,
553760	556080	it's new stuff, stealing mass from it.
556880	558400	As the black hole shrinks,
558400	560560	the Hawking radiation gets stronger,
560560	561920	faster and faster,
561920	564320	until what's left eventually evaporates
564320	567200	in a flash of high-energy radiation like a nuclear bomb.
567840	569360	And then, nothing.
570080	572080	But that won't happen for a long, long time.
572880	578000	A black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10 to the power of 67 years.
578640	585360	Which means that it would take 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years
585360	591200	to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.
592400	595280	But most black holes are way more massive than our sun.
596080	599680	The most massive supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies
599680	602720	have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years.
603600	604480	How long is that?
605680	611120	Imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe.
611760	616160	Every 10 billion years, one single grain of sand falls to the bottom.
617200	619840	If we waited for all the sand to fall down,
619840	623840	not even 1% of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed.
624640	629280	There is no good concept to help our brains grasp these timescales.
630640	633200	Will we ever truly understand black holes?
634080	635840	Really know what's going on inside them?
636480	637280	No one knows.
638160	640240	We can only see their outsides,
640240	643280	and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong.
643840	646000	But it's okay to not know everything.
646000	648160	It just means there's still work to be done.
648800	651520	It means there are still mysteries to solve,
651520	654960	and big ideas to think about, which is why humans do science.
655840	661040	In the end, we can at least be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them,
661040	663600	before the last one melts away.
