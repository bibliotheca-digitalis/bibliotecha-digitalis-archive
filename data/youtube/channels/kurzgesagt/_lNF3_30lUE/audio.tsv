0	3800	Atoms are ridiculous, and unbelievably small.
4200	10200	A single human hair is about as thick as 500,000 carbon atoms stacked over each other.
10400	15300	Look at your fist. It contains trillions and trillions of atoms.
15500	19800	If one atom in it were about as big as a marble, how big would your fist be?
20000	22100	Well, about the size of Earth.
22700	26400	Hmm, still hard to imagine? Let's try something different.
31000	37800	Look at your little finger. Imagine that its tip is as big as the room you're sitting in right now.
38000	40600	Now, fill the room with grains of rice.
40800	44000	One rice corn represents one cell of your fingertip.
44200	46200	Now let's zoom in on the rice corn.
46400	50200	And now, one cell is as big as the room you're in right now.
50400	52400	Let's fill it with rice again.
52600	55000	This is about the size of a protein.
55200	60800	And now, let us fill all the empty spaces between the rice corns with fine grains of sand.
61000	64200	This is roughly how small atoms are.
64800	66600	What is an atom made of?
66800	71800	Let us just pretend that atoms look like this for a minute to make it easier to understand.
72200	75200	An atom consists of three elementary particles.
75400	78200	Neutrons, protons, and electrons.
78800	83000	Protons and neutrons bind together and form the atom core.
83000	87800	Held together by the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.
88400	91800	They are made from quarks and held together by gluons.
92000	94800	Nobody knows exactly how small quarks are.
95200	98400	We think they might literally be points, like in geometry.
98600	101400	Try to imagine them as being zero-dimensional.
101800	106800	We suspect that quarks and electrons are the most fundamental components of matter in the universe.
107200	109200	Electrons orbit the atom core.
109400	113400	They travel at a speed of about 2,200 kilometers per second.
113600	117000	Fast enough to get around the Earth in just over 18 seconds.
117200	121200	Like quarks, we think electrons are fundamental particles.
121400	130600	99.99999999999% of an atom's volume is just empty space.
130800	132600	Except that it isn't.
133200	139000	What we perceive as emptiness is actually a space filled by quantum fluctuations.
139200	143600	Fields that have potential energy and build and dissolve spontaneously.
143800	148000	These fluctuations have a fundamental impact on how charged particles interact.
148200	150000	But that's a topic for another video.
150400	154200	How much space do the core and electrons actually fill?
154400	158800	If you were to subtract all the spaces between the atom cores from the Empire State Building,
159000	161000	it would be about as big as a rice corn.
161400	164800	All the atoms of humanity would fit in a teaspoon.
165000	169000	There are extreme objects where states like this actually exist.
169200	172600	In a neutron star, atom cores are compacted so densely
172800	177000	that the mass of three suns fits into an object only a few kilometers wide.
177200	180800	By the way, what do atoms look like?
181000	183400	Well, kind of like this.
183600	187400	Electrons are like a wave function and a particle at the same time.
187600	191400	We can calculate where an electron might be at any given moment in time.
191600	194400	These clouds of probability, called orbitals,
194600	198000	are where electrons might be with a certainty of 95%.
198200	201000	The probability of finding an electron approaches zero
201200	203200	the further we get away from the atom core.
203400	207200	But it actually never is zero, which means that, in theory,
207400	210800	the electron of an atom could be on the other side of the universe.
211000	212600	Okay, wait a second.
212800	216000	These strange thingies make up all the matter in the universe.
216200	218200	For many dozens of known elements,
218400	222400	you don't need many dozens of elementary particles, just three.
222600	226600	Take one proton and one electron, and you have hydrogen.
226800	229800	Add a proton and a neutron, you have helium.
230000	232000	Add a few more, you get carbon.
232200	235000	A few more, fluorine. Even more, gold.
235200	236400	And so on.
236600	239400	And every atom of an element is the same.
239600	243000	All hydrogen atoms in the universe, for example, are the same.
243200	247800	The hydrogen in your body is exactly the same as the hydrogen in the sun.
248000	249800	Do you feel confused right now?
250000	251000	We certainly do.
251200	254600	Nothing on this scale of the universe makes any sense in our world,
254800	257600	and we've not even begun talking about quantum mechanics
257800	260000	or the particle zoo, which are even stranger.
260200	264400	Our model of atoms has changed a number of times since we first conceived it,
264600	267000	and the current one will certainly not be the last.
267200	269800	So, let us support scientists and research,
270000	273400	and wait for the next wave of mind-boggling new information
273600	277600	about this strange world that is the basis for our existence.
