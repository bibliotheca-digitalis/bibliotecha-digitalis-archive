1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Atoms are ridiculous, and unbelievably small.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,200
A single human hair is about as thick as 500,000 carbon atoms stacked over each other.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,300
Look at your fist. It contains trillions and trillions of atoms.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,800
If one atom in it were about as big as a marble, how big would your fist be?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,100
Well, about the size of Earth.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,400
Hmm, still hard to imagine? Let's try something different.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Look at your little finger. Imagine that its tip is as big as the room you're sitting in right now.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Now, fill the room with grains of rice.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
One rice corn represents one cell of your fingertip.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Now let's zoom in on the rice corn.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,200
And now, one cell is as big as the room you're in right now.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Let's fill it with rice again.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,000
This is about the size of a protein.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,800
And now, let us fill all the empty spaces between the rice corns with fine grains of sand.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,200
This is roughly how small atoms are.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
What is an atom made of?

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Let us just pretend that atoms look like this for a minute to make it easier to understand.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
An atom consists of three elementary particles.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,200
Neutrons, protons, and electrons.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Protons and neutrons bind together and form the atom core.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Held together by the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,800
They are made from quarks and held together by gluons.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Nobody knows exactly how small quarks are.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
We think they might literally be points, like in geometry.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Try to imagine them as being zero-dimensional.

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,800
We suspect that quarks and electrons are the most fundamental components of matter in the universe.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Electrons orbit the atom core.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,400
They travel at a speed of about 2,200 kilometers per second.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Fast enough to get around the Earth in just over 18 seconds.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Like quarks, we think electrons are fundamental particles.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:10,600
99.99999999999% of an atom's volume is just empty space.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Except that it isn't.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,000
What we perceive as emptiness is actually a space filled by quantum fluctuations.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Fields that have potential energy and build and dissolve spontaneously.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
These fluctuations have a fundamental impact on how charged particles interact.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
But that's a topic for another video.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,200
How much space do the core and electrons actually fill?

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
If you were to subtract all the spaces between the atom cores from the Empire State Building,

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
it would be about as big as a rice corn.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,800
All the atoms of humanity would fit in a teaspoon.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There are extreme objects where states like this actually exist.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,600
In a neutron star, atom cores are compacted so densely

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,000
that the mass of three suns fits into an object only a few kilometers wide.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
By the way, what do atoms look like?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,400
Well, kind of like this.

46
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,400
Electrons are like a wave function and a particle at the same time.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,400
We can calculate where an electron might be at any given moment in time.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
These clouds of probability, called orbitals,

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,000
are where electrons might be with a certainty of 95%.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
The probability of finding an electron approaches zero

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
the further we get away from the atom core.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,200
But it actually never is zero, which means that, in theory,

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,800
the electron of an atom could be on the other side of the universe.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
Okay, wait a second.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,000
These strange thingies make up all the matter in the universe.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
For many dozens of known elements,

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
you don't need many dozens of elementary particles, just three.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Take one proton and one electron, and you have hydrogen.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Add a proton and a neutron, you have helium.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Add a few more, you get carbon.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,000
A few more, fluorine. Even more, gold.

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
And so on.

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
And every atom of an element is the same.

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,000
All hydrogen atoms in the universe, for example, are the same.

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,800
The hydrogen in your body is exactly the same as the hydrogen in the sun.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Do you feel confused right now?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We certainly do.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Nothing on this scale of the universe makes any sense in our world,

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
and we've not even begun talking about quantum mechanics

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
or the particle zoo, which are even stranger.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Our model of atoms has changed a number of times since we first conceived it,

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
and the current one will certainly not be the last.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
So, let us support scientists and research,

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,400
and wait for the next wave of mind-boggling new information

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
about this strange world that is the basis for our existence.
