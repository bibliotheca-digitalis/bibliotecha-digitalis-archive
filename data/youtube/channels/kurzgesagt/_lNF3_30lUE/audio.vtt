00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Atoms are ridiculous, and unbelievably small.

00:04.200 --> 00:10.200
A single human hair is about as thick as 500,000 carbon atoms stacked over each other.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.300
Look at your fist. It contains trillions and trillions of atoms.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.800
If one atom in it were about as big as a marble, how big would your fist be?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.100
Well, about the size of Earth.

00:22.700 --> 00:26.400
Hmm, still hard to imagine? Let's try something different.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.800
Look at your little finger. Imagine that its tip is as big as the room you're sitting in right now.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.600
Now, fill the room with grains of rice.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
One rice corn represents one cell of your fingertip.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.200
Now let's zoom in on the rice corn.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.200
And now, one cell is as big as the room you're in right now.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.400
Let's fill it with rice again.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.000
This is about the size of a protein.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.800
And now, let us fill all the empty spaces between the rice corns with fine grains of sand.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.200
This is roughly how small atoms are.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.600
What is an atom made of?

01:06.800 --> 01:11.800
Let us just pretend that atoms look like this for a minute to make it easier to understand.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.200
An atom consists of three elementary particles.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.200
Neutrons, protons, and electrons.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.000
Protons and neutrons bind together and form the atom core.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.800
Held together by the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.800
They are made from quarks and held together by gluons.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.800
Nobody knows exactly how small quarks are.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.400
We think they might literally be points, like in geometry.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.400
Try to imagine them as being zero-dimensional.

01:41.800 --> 01:46.800
We suspect that quarks and electrons are the most fundamental components of matter in the universe.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.200
Electrons orbit the atom core.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.400
They travel at a speed of about 2,200 kilometers per second.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.000
Fast enough to get around the Earth in just over 18 seconds.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.200
Like quarks, we think electrons are fundamental particles.

02:01.400 --> 02:10.600
99.99999999999% of an atom's volume is just empty space.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.600
Except that it isn't.

02:13.200 --> 02:19.000
What we perceive as emptiness is actually a space filled by quantum fluctuations.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.600
Fields that have potential energy and build and dissolve spontaneously.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.000
These fluctuations have a fundamental impact on how charged particles interact.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.000
But that's a topic for another video.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.200
How much space do the core and electrons actually fill?

02:34.400 --> 02:38.800
If you were to subtract all the spaces between the atom cores from the Empire State Building,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
it would be about as big as a rice corn.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.800
All the atoms of humanity would fit in a teaspoon.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
There are extreme objects where states like this actually exist.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.600
In a neutron star, atom cores are compacted so densely

02:52.800 --> 02:57.000
that the mass of three suns fits into an object only a few kilometers wide.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.800
By the way, what do atoms look like?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.400
Well, kind of like this.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.400
Electrons are like a wave function and a particle at the same time.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.400
We can calculate where an electron might be at any given moment in time.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.400
These clouds of probability, called orbitals,

03:14.600 --> 03:18.000
are where electrons might be with a certainty of 95%.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.000
The probability of finding an electron approaches zero

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
the further we get away from the atom core.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.200
But it actually never is zero, which means that, in theory,

03:27.400 --> 03:30.800
the electron of an atom could be on the other side of the universe.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.600
Okay, wait a second.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.000
These strange thingies make up all the matter in the universe.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.200
For many dozens of known elements,

03:38.400 --> 03:42.400
you don't need many dozens of elementary particles, just three.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.600
Take one proton and one electron, and you have hydrogen.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.800
Add a proton and a neutron, you have helium.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Add a few more, you get carbon.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.000
A few more, fluorine. Even more, gold.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.400
And so on.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.400
And every atom of an element is the same.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.000
All hydrogen atoms in the universe, for example, are the same.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.800
The hydrogen in your body is exactly the same as the hydrogen in the sun.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.800
Do you feel confused right now?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
We certainly do.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.600
Nothing on this scale of the universe makes any sense in our world,

04:14.800 --> 04:17.600
and we've not even begun talking about quantum mechanics

04:17.800 --> 04:20.000
or the particle zoo, which are even stranger.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.400
Our model of atoms has changed a number of times since we first conceived it,

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
and the current one will certainly not be the last.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.800
So, let us support scientists and research,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.400
and wait for the next wave of mind-boggling new information

04:33.600 --> 04:37.600
about this strange world that is the basis for our existence.
