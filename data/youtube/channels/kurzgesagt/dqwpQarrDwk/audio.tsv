0	6720	Getting to space is hard. Right now, it's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with
6720	12240	a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff,
12240	18560	and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km an hour to escape
18560	24280	from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel, with a tiny
24280	29400	tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planet, because you need a lot
29400	35440	of heavy stuff if you want to survive and maybe even come back. So is there a way to
35440	48840	get to space with less fuel and more payload?
48840	54680	A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure.
54680	59600	Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we've made it easier
59600	66140	to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will
66140	73240	make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great,
73240	78600	but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently
78600	84640	science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science
84640	89960	or magic materials or huge investments and that has been tested successfully in orbit
89960	98240	already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple, it's surprising.
98240	103640	What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft
103640	110480	use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the
110480	115820	Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. The counterweight holds a long cable
115820	121160	in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative
121160	126040	to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means
126040	130480	that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more
130480	136320	or less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already
136320	141320	exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To
141320	146140	protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into
146140	151720	a web of redundant fibers. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a
151720	157280	day, this would allow small reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it's not that
157280	161800	easy. At its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around
161800	166720	12,000 kilometers per hour. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can't lower the Skyhook too
166720	173000	much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers
173000	179320	and no lower. To match this, we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While
179320	184500	this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled with rocket
184500	190580	fuel to go 40,000 kilometers an hour. Catching the tip will be a challenge too. There's only
190580	196100	a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky moving at Mach
196100	201980	12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line a kilometer long with
201980	206940	a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge is keeping our
206940	212180	Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up, they use up
212180	217340	the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don't do anything, it will slow down and crash
217340	224460	into the atmosphere. And here we can cheat the universe a bit. The Skyhook is a battery
224460	230220	of orbital energy. It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off.
230220	235300	Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth add energy to the tether, which
235300	240260	it can give to other ships departing into space. This way, the tether doesn't lose any
240260	245900	energy. The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each
245900	250540	boost, we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct
250540	255420	the tether's position. A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars, could make
255420	261060	trips between the planets fast, straightforward, and low-cost compared to rockets. The Earth
261060	264860	tether would sit in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to
264860	270820	Mars. The Mars tether catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In
270820	274660	the opposite direction, the tether could pick up a vehicle traveling through Mars's thin
274700	279640	atmosphere at only about 1,000 kilometers an hour, not much faster than our airliners
279640	284940	on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down. The tethers could
284940	290040	shorten trips between both planets from nine months down to five or even three and reduce
290040	297100	the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96%. Even better, people may be able
297100	302820	to travel in relative luxury as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort. Tether travel
302820	308060	would be first-class seats to Mars. Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could provide
308060	313900	the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable.
313900	318980	But let's go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid
318980	324940	belt. The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination.
324940	330420	Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free.
330420	335940	Going to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.
335940	340020	Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they
340020	345420	were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary
345420	351820	civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the
351820	357120	solar system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to
357120	361640	worry about slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super tethers
361640	367800	just under 6,000 km long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very
367800	373960	easy to catch. The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same
373960	380000	super tether can also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single
380000	386900	swing away. Unlike Mars, they're bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals.
386900	391780	In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellant transport
391780	397460	network for the terrestrial planets centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably
397460	402760	cheap and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar
402760	408760	system accessible for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to
408760	414980	build them today, there's really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system
414980	422680	are far away, but they could be very close. Speaking of stuff that's hard to reach but
422680	428560	doesn't have to be, knowledge. Our friends from Brilliant can hook you up to a universe
