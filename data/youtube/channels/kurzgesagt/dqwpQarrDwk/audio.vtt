00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Getting to space is hard. Right now, it's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with

00:06.720 --> 00:12.240
a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff,

00:12.240 --> 00:18.560
and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km an hour to escape

00:18.560 --> 00:24.280
from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel, with a tiny

00:24.280 --> 00:29.400
tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planet, because you need a lot

00:29.400 --> 00:35.440
of heavy stuff if you want to survive and maybe even come back. So is there a way to

00:35.440 --> 00:48.840
get to space with less fuel and more payload?

00:48.840 --> 00:54.680
A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.600
Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we've made it easier

00:59.600 --> 01:06.140
to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will

01:06.140 --> 01:13.240
make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great,

01:13.240 --> 01:18.600
but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently

01:18.600 --> 01:24.640
science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science

01:24.640 --> 01:29.960
or magic materials or huge investments and that has been tested successfully in orbit

01:29.960 --> 01:38.240
already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple, it's surprising.

01:38.240 --> 01:43.640
What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft

01:43.640 --> 01:50.480
use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the

01:50.480 --> 01:55.820
Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. The counterweight holds a long cable

01:55.820 --> 02:01.160
in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative

02:01.160 --> 02:06.040
to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means

02:06.040 --> 02:10.480
that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more

02:10.480 --> 02:16.320
or less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already

02:16.320 --> 02:21.320
exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To

02:21.320 --> 02:26.140
protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into

02:26.140 --> 02:31.720
a web of redundant fibers. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a

02:31.720 --> 02:37.280
day, this would allow small reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it's not that

02:37.280 --> 02:41.800
easy. At its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around

02:41.800 --> 02:46.720
12,000 kilometers per hour. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can't lower the Skyhook too

02:46.720 --> 02:53.000
much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers

02:53.000 --> 02:59.320
and no lower. To match this, we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While

02:59.320 --> 03:04.500
this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled with rocket

03:04.500 --> 03:10.580
fuel to go 40,000 kilometers an hour. Catching the tip will be a challenge too. There's only

03:10.580 --> 03:16.100
a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky moving at Mach

03:16.100 --> 03:21.980
12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line a kilometer long with

03:21.980 --> 03:26.940
a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge is keeping our

03:26.940 --> 03:32.180
Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up, they use up

03:32.180 --> 03:37.340
the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don't do anything, it will slow down and crash

03:37.340 --> 03:44.460
into the atmosphere. And here we can cheat the universe a bit. The Skyhook is a battery

03:44.460 --> 03:50.220
of orbital energy. It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off.

03:50.220 --> 03:55.300
Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth add energy to the tether, which

03:55.300 --> 04:00.260
it can give to other ships departing into space. This way, the tether doesn't lose any

04:00.260 --> 04:05.900
energy. The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each

04:05.900 --> 04:10.540
boost, we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct

04:10.540 --> 04:15.420
the tether's position. A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars, could make

04:15.420 --> 04:21.060
trips between the planets fast, straightforward, and low-cost compared to rockets. The Earth

04:21.060 --> 04:24.860
tether would sit in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to

04:24.860 --> 04:30.820
Mars. The Mars tether catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In

04:30.820 --> 04:34.660
the opposite direction, the tether could pick up a vehicle traveling through Mars's thin

04:34.700 --> 04:39.640
atmosphere at only about 1,000 kilometers an hour, not much faster than our airliners

04:39.640 --> 04:44.940
on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down. The tethers could

04:44.940 --> 04:50.040
shorten trips between both planets from nine months down to five or even three and reduce

04:50.040 --> 04:57.100
the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96%. Even better, people may be able

04:57.100 --> 05:02.820
to travel in relative luxury as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort. Tether travel

05:02.820 --> 05:08.060
would be first-class seats to Mars. Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could provide

05:08.060 --> 05:13.900
the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.980
But let's go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid

05:18.980 --> 05:24.940
belt. The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination.

05:24.940 --> 05:30.420
Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free.

05:30.420 --> 05:35.940
Going to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system.

05:35.940 --> 05:40.020
Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they

05:40.020 --> 05:45.420
were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary

05:45.420 --> 05:51.820
civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the

05:51.820 --> 05:57.120
solar system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to

05:57.120 --> 06:01.640
worry about slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super tethers

06:01.640 --> 06:07.800
just under 6,000 km long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very

06:07.800 --> 06:13.960
easy to catch. The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same

06:13.960 --> 06:20.000
super tether can also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single

06:20.000 --> 06:26.900
swing away. Unlike Mars, they're bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.780
In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellant transport

06:31.780 --> 06:37.460
network for the terrestrial planets centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably

06:37.460 --> 06:42.760
cheap and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar

06:42.760 --> 06:48.760
system accessible for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to

06:48.760 --> 06:54.980
build them today, there's really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system

06:54.980 --> 07:02.680
are far away, but they could be very close. Speaking of stuff that's hard to reach but

07:02.680 --> 07:08.560
