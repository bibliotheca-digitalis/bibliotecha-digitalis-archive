1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
To answer this question, we'll first explain how we research them and then talk a bit about

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,620
past videos and what we want to achieve with the channel.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,460
Making a Kurzgesagt video always begins with a question or an issue.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,860
For example, after our meat video, many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,980
humans.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,780
We had no idea and were pretty curious too, so we just decided to work on it.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,080
The first step is research.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,540
We start by looking for books and scientific papers to get an overview and just read a

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
lot.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,420
The plan is to find a story worth telling.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,500
Is there something surprising to learn?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Is there a larger context or a new perspective, or will it be an overview or introduction?

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,860
Once we have the first readable version, we reach out to experts or scientists and ask

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,940
them to fact-check and correct us.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,840
Often enough, they find a flaw or point us in the direction of contradictory research.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,660
At this point, many scripts die.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,280
If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
This process can take weeks or months.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Our loneliness script, for example, took over a year and a half to finish.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,940
The hardest part is being brief while not simplifying too much.

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,840
It's much easier to write a long script than a short one.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,600
When we're finally done, we do another round of research and show the script to experts

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,920
again, ideally different ones than the ones we talked to at the beginning of the process.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,680
When we express an opinion, we mark it as such.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,720
That's not saying that we don't draw conclusions from the research.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,080
Homeopathy does not work, and meat is really bad for the planet.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,800
Climate change is real, but organic food is not a good way of solving it.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,440
If the facts clearly support a conclusion, it's okay to present it as such.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,680
Of course, we can't always make everybody happy.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,480
People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed if we don't mention an aspect

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,580
they think is crucial or when we omit technical terms.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,000
This is more or less unsolvable because of the nature of our videos.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,600
Scripts have around 1,300 words, so there's always some degree of simplification.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,520
You will always find a list of our research and sources and further reading material in

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,280
the video description.

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,920
Citing sources doesn't make your work accurate or your research good, though, so we encourage

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,800
you to use our sources document as a starting point to look at the topic yourself and learn

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
more.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,220
But it would be dishonest to say that we've always worked this way.

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,760
Some older videos don't live up to the standards we set ourselves today.

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,200
The two that annoy us the most are the refugee and addiction videos.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,260
In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective, but instead chose

44
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,240
a take and ran with it.

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,600
The refugee video was made with a deep feeling of angry frustration about the world at the

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,080
high point of the 2015 refugee crisis.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,880
While we argued over quotas, dead children washed ashore on our coastlines.

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,200
The script was written on one Sunday afternoon and illustrated and animated within a week.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,720
It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating.

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,080
We still believe it was the right thing for European countries to help, but it was absolutely

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,940
unnecessary to be toxic about it.

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,300
We insulted people and brushed away their concerns about real and profound challenges.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,460
The video was divisive and emotional at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,260
overview.

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,780
The addiction video was based on only one source that has amassed a lot of criticism

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,180
over the years.

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,040
And unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,620
that were the basis for the video's thesis, that addiction is purely psychological and

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,980
based on the life circumstances of the individual.

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,860
This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals and we're not saying it's wrong,

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,460
but a lot of others disagree and it's not correct to present it as the truth.

62
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,760
Addiction is far from solved and our video should have reflected that instead of taking

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,300
one side.

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,140
We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,020
Both videos were made over the span of two months and they're two of our most successful

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,260
videos to date.

67
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,580
We had found a formula that really worked, but we never made anything like them again

68
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,060
and have been discussing how to deal with them for a long time.

69
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,920
It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people.

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,880
We want to be proud of our work and these two videos don't make us proud.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,060
So today we deleted them.

72
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,580
It won't purge them from the internet, but that's not the goal anyway.

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,820
Feel free to upload them elsewhere.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,860
We're working on a new addiction video that will take a look at the chemical and psychological

75
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
causes.

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,020
We'll take our sweet time with it, so please have patience.

77
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,860
The refugee video is not up to date anymore, so we will not renew it.

78
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,100
We're also going through our older videos to add sources, further reading and comments

79
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,900
in the next few months.

80
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,460
Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look at creators on

81
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,020
the internet for reliable information.

82
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,300
We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous and not led by monetary incentives.

83
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,900
And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes in public and work to minimize them.

84
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,120
So this is what we're going to do.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,520
Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever, you have to constantly work

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,780
for it.

87
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,140
So, can you trust Kurzgesagt?

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,760
You can trust that every video we make is thoroughly researched and approved by different

89
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,860
experts.

90
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,140
You can trust that we know that we have biases and we try to overcome them.

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,460
We want to move Kurzgesagt further towards the trustworthy end of the spectrum.

92
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,400
The world is too complex for simple answers and we don't want to be the ones giving them.

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,880
Making these videos over the last six years has been quite a ride and we're very grateful

94
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
for it.

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,060
We hope you'll be with us for the next few years too, and join us on our journey to figure

96
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,940
out what this universe and life stuff is all about.

97
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Thank you for watching.

98
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,220
you
