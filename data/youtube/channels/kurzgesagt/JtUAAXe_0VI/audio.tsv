0	5500	Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos?
5500	9500	To answer this question, we'll first explain how we research them and then talk a bit about
9500	13620	past videos and what we want to achieve with the channel.
13620	17460	Making a Kurzgesagt video always begins with a question or an issue.
17460	21860	For example, after our meat video, many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on
21860	22980	humans.
22980	27780	We had no idea and were pretty curious too, so we just decided to work on it.
27780	30080	The first step is research.
30080	34540	We start by looking for books and scientific papers to get an overview and just read a
34540	35540	lot.
35540	38420	The plan is to find a story worth telling.
38420	40500	Is there something surprising to learn?
40500	46500	Is there a larger context or a new perspective, or will it be an overview or introduction?
46500	50860	Once we have the first readable version, we reach out to experts or scientists and ask
50860	53940	them to fact-check and correct us.
54220	58840	Often enough, they find a flaw or point us in the direction of contradictory research.
58840	61660	At this point, many scripts die.
61660	65280	If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it.
65280	68400	This process can take weeks or months.
68400	72600	Our loneliness script, for example, took over a year and a half to finish.
72600	76940	The hardest part is being brief while not simplifying too much.
76940	80840	It's much easier to write a long script than a short one.
80840	84600	When we're finally done, we do another round of research and show the script to experts
84600	89920	again, ideally different ones than the ones we talked to at the beginning of the process.
89920	92680	When we express an opinion, we mark it as such.
92680	96720	That's not saying that we don't draw conclusions from the research.
96720	101080	Homeopathy does not work, and meat is really bad for the planet.
101080	105800	Climate change is real, but organic food is not a good way of solving it.
105800	110440	If the facts clearly support a conclusion, it's okay to present it as such.
110440	113680	Of course, we can't always make everybody happy.
113680	117480	People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed if we don't mention an aspect
117480	121580	they think is crucial or when we omit technical terms.
121580	126000	This is more or less unsolvable because of the nature of our videos.
126000	131600	Scripts have around 1,300 words, so there's always some degree of simplification.
131600	135520	You will always find a list of our research and sources and further reading material in
135520	137280	the video description.
137320	141920	Citing sources doesn't make your work accurate or your research good, though, so we encourage
141920	146800	you to use our sources document as a starting point to look at the topic yourself and learn
146800	147800	more.
147800	152220	But it would be dishonest to say that we've always worked this way.
152220	156760	Some older videos don't live up to the standards we set ourselves today.
156760	161200	The two that annoy us the most are the refugee and addiction videos.
161200	165260	In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective, but instead chose
165260	167240	a take and ran with it.
167240	171600	The refugee video was made with a deep feeling of angry frustration about the world at the
171600	175080	high point of the 2015 refugee crisis.
175080	179880	While we argued over quotas, dead children washed ashore on our coastlines.
179880	185200	The script was written on one Sunday afternoon and illustrated and animated within a week.
185200	188720	It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating.
188720	193080	We still believe it was the right thing for European countries to help, but it was absolutely
193080	195940	unnecessary to be toxic about it.
195940	201300	We insulted people and brushed away their concerns about real and profound challenges.
201300	206460	The video was divisive and emotional at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear
206460	208260	overview.
208260	212780	The addiction video was based on only one source that has amassed a lot of criticism
212780	214180	over the years.
214180	219040	And unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers
219040	223620	that were the basis for the video's thesis, that addiction is purely psychological and
223620	226980	based on the life circumstances of the individual.
226980	231860	This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals and we're not saying it's wrong,
231860	237460	but a lot of others disagree and it's not correct to present it as the truth.
237460	241760	Addiction is far from solved and our video should have reflected that instead of taking
241760	243300	one side.
243300	249140	We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.
249140	253020	Both videos were made over the span of two months and they're two of our most successful
253020	254260	videos to date.
254260	258580	We had found a formula that really worked, but we never made anything like them again
258580	262060	and have been discussing how to deal with them for a long time.
262060	265920	It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people.
265920	270880	We want to be proud of our work and these two videos don't make us proud.
270880	273060	So today we deleted them.
273060	276580	It won't purge them from the internet, but that's not the goal anyway.
276580	278820	Feel free to upload them elsewhere.
278820	282860	We're working on a new addiction video that will take a look at the chemical and psychological
282860	283860	causes.
283860	288020	We'll take our sweet time with it, so please have patience.
288020	292860	The refugee video is not up to date anymore, so we will not renew it.
292860	297100	We're also going through our older videos to add sources, further reading and comments
297100	298900	in the next few months.
298900	303460	Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look at creators on
303460	306020	the internet for reliable information.
306020	311300	We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous and not led by monetary incentives.
311300	315900	And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes in public and work to minimize them.
315900	318120	So this is what we're going to do.
318120	322520	Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever, you have to constantly work
322520	323780	for it.
323780	327140	So, can you trust Kurzgesagt?
327140	331760	You can trust that every video we make is thoroughly researched and approved by different
331760	332860	experts.
332860	337140	You can trust that we know that we have biases and we try to overcome them.
337140	341460	We want to move Kurzgesagt further towards the trustworthy end of the spectrum.
341460	346400	The world is too complex for simple answers and we don't want to be the ones giving them.
346400	350880	Making these videos over the last six years has been quite a ride and we're very grateful
350880	351880	for it.
351880	356060	We hope you'll be with us for the next few years too, and join us on our journey to figure
356060	359940	out what this universe and life stuff is all about.
359940	360940	Thank you for watching.
367140	369220	you
