00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos?

00:05.500 --> 00:09.500
To answer this question, we'll first explain how we research them and then talk a bit about

00:09.500 --> 00:13.620
past videos and what we want to achieve with the channel.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.460
Making a Kurzgesagt video always begins with a question or an issue.

00:17.460 --> 00:21.860
For example, after our meat video, many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on

00:21.860 --> 00:22.980
humans.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.780
We had no idea and were pretty curious too, so we just decided to work on it.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.080
The first step is research.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.540
We start by looking for books and scientific papers to get an overview and just read a

00:34.540 --> 00:35.540
lot.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.420
The plan is to find a story worth telling.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.500
Is there something surprising to learn?

00:40.500 --> 00:46.500
Is there a larger context or a new perspective, or will it be an overview or introduction?

00:46.500 --> 00:50.860
Once we have the first readable version, we reach out to experts or scientists and ask

00:50.860 --> 00:53.940
them to fact-check and correct us.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.840
Often enough, they find a flaw or point us in the direction of contradictory research.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.660
At this point, many scripts die.

01:01.660 --> 01:05.280
If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.400
This process can take weeks or months.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.600
Our loneliness script, for example, took over a year and a half to finish.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.940
The hardest part is being brief while not simplifying too much.

01:16.940 --> 01:20.840
It's much easier to write a long script than a short one.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.600
When we're finally done, we do another round of research and show the script to experts

01:24.600 --> 01:29.920
again, ideally different ones than the ones we talked to at the beginning of the process.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.680
When we express an opinion, we mark it as such.

01:32.680 --> 01:36.720
That's not saying that we don't draw conclusions from the research.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.080
Homeopathy does not work, and meat is really bad for the planet.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.800
Climate change is real, but organic food is not a good way of solving it.

01:45.800 --> 01:50.440
If the facts clearly support a conclusion, it's okay to present it as such.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.680
Of course, we can't always make everybody happy.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.480
People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed if we don't mention an aspect

01:57.480 --> 02:01.580
they think is crucial or when we omit technical terms.

02:01.580 --> 02:06.000
This is more or less unsolvable because of the nature of our videos.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.600
Scripts have around 1,300 words, so there's always some degree of simplification.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.520
You will always find a list of our research and sources and further reading material in

02:15.520 --> 02:17.280
the video description.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.920
Citing sources doesn't make your work accurate or your research good, though, so we encourage

02:21.920 --> 02:26.800
you to use our sources document as a starting point to look at the topic yourself and learn

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
more.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.220
But it would be dishonest to say that we've always worked this way.

02:32.220 --> 02:36.760
Some older videos don't live up to the standards we set ourselves today.

02:36.760 --> 02:41.200
The two that annoy us the most are the refugee and addiction videos.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.260
In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective, but instead chose

02:45.260 --> 02:47.240
a take and ran with it.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.600
The refugee video was made with a deep feeling of angry frustration about the world at the

02:51.600 --> 02:55.080
high point of the 2015 refugee crisis.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.880
While we argued over quotas, dead children washed ashore on our coastlines.

02:59.880 --> 03:05.200
The script was written on one Sunday afternoon and illustrated and animated within a week.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.720
It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating.

03:08.720 --> 03:13.080
We still believe it was the right thing for European countries to help, but it was absolutely

03:13.080 --> 03:15.940
unnecessary to be toxic about it.

03:15.940 --> 03:21.300
We insulted people and brushed away their concerns about real and profound challenges.

03:21.300 --> 03:26.460
The video was divisive and emotional at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear

03:26.460 --> 03:28.260
overview.

03:28.260 --> 03:32.780
The addiction video was based on only one source that has amassed a lot of criticism

03:32.780 --> 03:34.180
over the years.

03:34.180 --> 03:39.040
And unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers

03:39.040 --> 03:43.620
that were the basis for the video's thesis, that addiction is purely psychological and

03:43.620 --> 03:46.980
based on the life circumstances of the individual.

03:46.980 --> 03:51.860
This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals and we're not saying it's wrong,

03:51.860 --> 03:57.460
but a lot of others disagree and it's not correct to present it as the truth.

03:57.460 --> 04:01.760
Addiction is far from solved and our video should have reflected that instead of taking

04:01.760 --> 04:03.300
one side.

04:03.300 --> 04:09.140
We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.

04:09.140 --> 04:13.020
Both videos were made over the span of two months and they're two of our most successful

04:13.020 --> 04:14.260
videos to date.

04:14.260 --> 04:18.580
We had found a formula that really worked, but we never made anything like them again

04:18.580 --> 04:22.060
and have been discussing how to deal with them for a long time.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.920
It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.880
We want to be proud of our work and these two videos don't make us proud.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.060
So today we deleted them.

04:33.060 --> 04:36.580
It won't purge them from the internet, but that's not the goal anyway.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.820
Feel free to upload them elsewhere.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.860
We're working on a new addiction video that will take a look at the chemical and psychological

04:42.860 --> 04:43.860
causes.

04:43.860 --> 04:48.020
We'll take our sweet time with it, so please have patience.

04:48.020 --> 04:52.860
The refugee video is not up to date anymore, so we will not renew it.

04:52.860 --> 04:57.100
We're also going through our older videos to add sources, further reading and comments

04:57.100 --> 04:58.900
in the next few months.

04:58.900 --> 05:03.460
Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look at creators on

05:03.460 --> 05:06.020
the internet for reliable information.

05:06.020 --> 05:11.300
We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous and not led by monetary incentives.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.900
And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes in public and work to minimize them.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.120
So this is what we're going to do.

05:18.120 --> 05:22.520
Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever, you have to constantly work

05:22.520 --> 05:23.780
for it.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.140
So, can you trust Kurzgesagt?

05:27.140 --> 05:31.760
You can trust that every video we make is thoroughly researched and approved by different

05:31.760 --> 05:32.860
experts.

05:32.860 --> 05:37.140
You can trust that we know that we have biases and we try to overcome them.

05:37.140 --> 05:41.460
We want to move Kurzgesagt further towards the trustworthy end of the spectrum.

05:41.460 --> 05:46.400
The world is too complex for simple answers and we don't want to be the ones giving them.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.880
Making these videos over the last six years has been quite a ride and we're very grateful

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
for it.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.060
We hope you'll be with us for the next few years too, and join us on our journey to figure

05:56.060 --> 05:59.940
out what this universe and life stuff is all about.

05:59.940 --> 06:00.940
Thank you for watching.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.220
you
