00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence. They don't seem to make any sense at all.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,940
Where do they come from? And what happens if you fall into one?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,800
Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms that collapse from enormous gas clouds under their own gravity.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,800
In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,360
This energy, in the form of radiation, pushes against gravity, maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,600
As long as there is fusion in the core, a star remains stable enough.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,640
But for stars with way more mass than our own Sun, the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
until they reach iron.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,020
Unlike all the elements that went before, the fusion process that creates iron doesn't generate any energy.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,760
Iron builds up at the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount, and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken.

11
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,220
The core collapses. Within a fraction of a second, the star implodes,

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,740
moving at about a quarter of the speed of light, feeding even more mass into the core.

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:21,580
It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created as the star dies in a supernova explosion.

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,900
This produces either a neutron star, or if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core

15
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,620
collapses into a black hole. If you looked at a black hole, what you'd really be seeing is the event horizon.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,140
Anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be traveling faster than the speed of light to escape. In other words, it's impossible.

17
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,020
So we just see a black sphere reflecting nothing.

18
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,100
But if the event horizon is the black part, what is the whole part of the black hole? The singularity.

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,020
We're not sure what it is exactly.

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,540
A singularity may be infinitely dense, meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space with no surface or volume,

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,540
or something completely different.

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,180
Right now, we just don't know. It's like a dividing by zero error.

23
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,020
By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner. If we were to swap the Sun for an equally massive

24
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,220
black hole, nothing much would change for Earth, except that we would freeze to death, of course.

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,380
What would happen to you if you fell into a black hole?

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,680
The experience of time is different around black holes. From the outside, you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon,

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,620
so time passes slower for you. At some point, you would appear to freeze in time, slowly turn red, and disappear.

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,580
While from your perspective, you can watch the rest of the universe in fast-forward, kind of like seeing into the future.

29
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,040
Right now, we don't know what happens next, but we think it could be one of two things.

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,100
One, you die a quick death. A black hole curves space so much that once you cross the event horizon,

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,220
there is only one possible direction. You can take this literally inside the event horizon. You can only go in one direction.

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,020
It's like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,980
The mass of a black hole is so concentrated, at some point, even tiny distances of a few centimeters would mean that gravity acts with

34
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,780
millions of times more force on different parts of your body.

35
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,740
Your cells get torn apart as your body stretches more and more until you're a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide.

36
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,800
Two, you die a very quick death. Very soon after you cross the event horizon, you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant.

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,140
Neither of these options are particularly pleasant.

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,780
How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole.

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,700
A smaller black hole would kill you before you even entered its event horizon, while you probably could travel inside a supermassive black hole for quite a while.

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,980
As a rule of thumb, the further away from the singularity you are, the longer you live.

41
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Black holes come in different sizes.

42
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,480
There are stellar mass black holes with a few times the mass of the Sun and the diameter of an asteroid, and then there are

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,360
these supermassive black holes, which are found at the heart of every galaxy and have been feeding for billions of years.

44
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,720
Currently, the largest supermassive black hole known is S5-0014 plus 81,

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,500
40 billion times the mass of our Sun. It is

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,640
236.7 billion kilometers in diameter, which is 47 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto. As

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,420
powerful as black holes are, they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation.

48
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,220
To understand how this works,

49
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,100
we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty, but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,800
annihilating each other again.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,060
When this happens right on the edge of a black hole,

52
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,760
one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole and the other will escape and become a real particle.

53
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,060
So the black hole is losing energy.

54
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,220
This happens incredibly slowly at first and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller.

55
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,320
When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid, it's radiating at room temperature.

56
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,260
When it has the mass of a mountain, it radiates with about the heat of our Sun, and in the last second of its life,

57
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,940
the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion.

58
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,960
But this process is incredibly slow. The biggest black holes we know might take up to a goog old years to evaporate.

59
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,540
This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away,

60
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,460
nobody will be around to witness it. The universe will have become uninhabitable long before then.

61
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,500
This is not the end of our story. There are loads more interesting ideas about black holes. We'll explore them in part two.

62
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,380
A big thanks to Fraser Cain for help with this video.

63
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,700
By the way, we've made some Kurzgesagt wallpapers in 4k for different screen sizes.

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,200
You can get them on our Patreon page, which also helps us to make more videos, like this December, the first month ever with three videos.

65
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Thank you for watching!
