0	5320	Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence. They don't seem to make any sense at all.
5580	8940	Where do they come from? And what happens if you fall into one?
15520	22800	Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms that collapse from enormous gas clouds under their own gravity.
22980	28800	In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.
29200	36360	This energy, in the form of radiation, pushes against gravity, maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces.
36840	40600	As long as there is fusion in the core, a star remains stable enough.
40920	47640	But for stars with way more mass than our own Sun, the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements
47920	49920	until they reach iron.
50140	56020	Unlike all the elements that went before, the fusion process that creates iron doesn't generate any energy.
56420	63760	Iron builds up at the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount, and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken.
64220	69220	The core collapses. Within a fraction of a second, the star implodes,
69560	73740	moving at about a quarter of the speed of light, feeding even more mass into the core.
73980	81580	It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created as the star dies in a supernova explosion.
81660	87900	This produces either a neutron star, or if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core
88100	94620	collapses into a black hole. If you looked at a black hole, what you'd really be seeing is the event horizon.
95000	102140	Anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be traveling faster than the speed of light to escape. In other words, it's impossible.
102660	106020	So we just see a black sphere reflecting nothing.
106420	113100	But if the event horizon is the black part, what is the whole part of the black hole? The singularity.
113740	116020	We're not sure what it is exactly.
116700	123540	A singularity may be infinitely dense, meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space with no surface or volume,
123540	125540	or something completely different.
126060	130180	Right now, we just don't know. It's like a dividing by zero error.
130660	137020	By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner. If we were to swap the Sun for an equally massive
137020	141220	black hole, nothing much would change for Earth, except that we would freeze to death, of course.
141700	144380	What would happen to you if you fell into a black hole?
144620	151680	The experience of time is different around black holes. From the outside, you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon,
151740	158620	so time passes slower for you. At some point, you would appear to freeze in time, slowly turn red, and disappear.
158980	164580	While from your perspective, you can watch the rest of the universe in fast-forward, kind of like seeing into the future.
165220	169040	Right now, we don't know what happens next, but we think it could be one of two things.
169780	176100	One, you die a quick death. A black hole curves space so much that once you cross the event horizon,
176100	183220	there is only one possible direction. You can take this literally inside the event horizon. You can only go in one direction.
183940	188020	It's like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step.
188520	195980	The mass of a black hole is so concentrated, at some point, even tiny distances of a few centimeters would mean that gravity acts with
195980	198780	millions of times more force on different parts of your body.
198980	205740	Your cells get torn apart as your body stretches more and more until you're a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide.
206380	213800	Two, you die a very quick death. Very soon after you cross the event horizon, you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant.
214300	217140	Neither of these options are particularly pleasant.
217500	220780	How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole.
221180	228700	A smaller black hole would kill you before you even entered its event horizon, while you probably could travel inside a supermassive black hole for quite a while.
228700	232980	As a rule of thumb, the further away from the singularity you are, the longer you live.
233380	235380	Black holes come in different sizes.
235740	242480	There are stellar mass black holes with a few times the mass of the Sun and the diameter of an asteroid, and then there are
242520	248360	these supermassive black holes, which are found at the heart of every galaxy and have been feeding for billions of years.
249320	254720	Currently, the largest supermassive black hole known is S5-0014 plus 81,
255320	258500	40 billion times the mass of our Sun. It is
259240	265640	236.7 billion kilometers in diameter, which is 47 times the distance from the Sun to Pluto. As
266000	271420	powerful as black holes are, they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation.
271580	273220	To understand how this works,
273220	280100	we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty, but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and
280420	281800	annihilating each other again.
281800	284060	When this happens right on the edge of a black hole,
284100	289760	one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole and the other will escape and become a real particle.
289940	292060	So the black hole is losing energy.
292580	297220	This happens incredibly slowly at first and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller.
297660	301320	When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid, it's radiating at room temperature.
301820	307260	When it has the mass of a mountain, it radiates with about the heat of our Sun, and in the last second of its life,
307260	311940	the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion.
312420	318960	But this process is incredibly slow. The biggest black holes we know might take up to a goog old years to evaporate.
319220	322540	This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away,
322860	328460	nobody will be around to witness it. The universe will have become uninhabitable long before then.
328820	335500	This is not the end of our story. There are loads more interesting ideas about black holes. We'll explore them in part two.
336620	339380	A big thanks to Fraser Cain for help with this video.
340420	344700	By the way, we've made some Kurzgesagt wallpapers in 4k for different screen sizes.
344860	352200	You can get them on our Patreon page, which also helps us to make more videos, like this December, the first month ever with three videos.
352540	354540	Thank you for watching!
