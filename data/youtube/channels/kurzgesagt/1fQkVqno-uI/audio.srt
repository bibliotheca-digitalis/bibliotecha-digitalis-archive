1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth in the observable universe.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,100
We know that there might be trillions of planets, so where are all the aliens?

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,300
This is the Fermi Paradox.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,300
If you want to know more about it, watch Part 1.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,100
Here, we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,400
So, will we be destroyed, or does a glorious future await us?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Space travel is hard.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,700
Although possible, it's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,800
Massive amounts of material have to be put into orbit and assembled.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,400
A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,500
And the planet might not be as hospitable as it seemed from afar.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,800
It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,700
An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Also, consider time.

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,400
The universe is very old.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,600
On Earth, there's been life for at least 3.6 billion years.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years,

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,800
but only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,900
There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,200
and existed for millions of years, and we might just have missed them.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,500
99% of all species on Earth have died out.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,300
It's easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later.

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,700
Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems, and die off.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,500
Over and over again.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,600
But galactic civilizations might never meet,

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,700
so maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the universe to look at the stars and wonder,

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
where is everyone?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,500
But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us, or that our logic applies to them.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,900
It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated.

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,900
You'd keep sending messages, but nobody would answer, and you'd feel pretty lonely.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,500
Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligent species,

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,800
and we'll remain so until we learn to communicate properly.

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,100
And even if we met aliens, we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,500
Imagine the smartest squirrel you can.

37
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,500
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it.

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
After all, from the squirrel's perspective,

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,100
a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive.

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,100
So humans cutting down whole forests is madness.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,200
But we don't destroy forests because we hate squirrels.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
We just want the resources.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,700
The squirrel's wishes and the squirrel's survival are of no concern to us.

44
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,200
A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way.

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,300
They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier.

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,400
One of the aliens might think for a second,

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
oh, tiny little apes, they build really cute concrete structures.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Oh well, now they're dead, before activating warp speed.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,000
But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species,

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,600
it's far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,100
And anyway, it would be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon.

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,600
A self-replicating space probe made from nanomachines.

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
They operate on a molecular level incredibly fast and deadly,

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,500
with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,800
You only need to give them four instructions.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
One, find a planet with life.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,500
Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts.

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,900
Three, use the resources to build new space probes.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,300
Four, repeat.

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,300
A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years.

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,400
But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide?

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,000
The speed of light is actually not very fast.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If someone could travel at the speed of light,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
it would still take 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way once,

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,900
and you'll probably travel way slower.

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,300
There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,000
An interesting concept is the matryoshka brain,

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
a megastructure surrounding a star.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,100
A computer of such computing power,

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,600
that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
A perfect life.

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,000
If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to 10 trillion years.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms if this were an option?

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,700
All these solutions to the Fermi paradox have one problem.

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,900
We don't know where the borders of technology are.

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,200
We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it,

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
and super technology awaits us,

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,900
granting us immortality,

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
transporting us to other galaxies,

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,300
elevating us to the level of gods.

82
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,800
One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything.

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,200
Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,300
500 years ago, we thought we were the center of the universe.

85
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,900
200 years ago, we stopped using human neighbor as the main source of energy.

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,900
30 years ago, we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements.

87
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,700
In the galactic timescale, we are embryos.

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,900
We've come far, but still have a long way to go.

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,700
The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans,

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,000
so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
But in the end, there's only one way to find out, right?

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey everybody, we finally have our own subreddit.

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,200
