00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth in the observable universe.

00:05.600 --> 00:10.100
We know that there might be trillions of planets, so where are all the aliens?

00:10.100 --> 00:12.300
This is the Fermi Paradox.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.300
If you want to know more about it, watch Part 1.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.100
Here, we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox.

00:19.100 --> 00:23.400
So, will we be destroyed, or does a glorious future await us?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.800
Space travel is hard.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.700
Although possible, it's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.800
Massive amounts of material have to be put into orbit and assembled.

00:39.800 --> 00:46.400
A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.500
And the planet might not be as hospitable as it seemed from afar.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.800
It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.700
An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.700
Also, consider time.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.400
The universe is very old.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.600
On Earth, there's been life for at least 3.6 billion years.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.400
Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years,

01:10.400 --> 01:15.800
but only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.900
There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems

01:20.900 --> 01:25.200
and existed for millions of years, and we might just have missed them.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.600
There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.500
99% of all species on Earth have died out.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.300
It's easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later.

01:37.300 --> 01:42.700
Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems, and die off.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.500
Over and over again.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.600
But galactic civilizations might never meet,

01:47.600 --> 01:52.700
so maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the universe to look at the stars and wonder,

01:52.700 --> 01:54.000
where is everyone?

01:54.000 --> 02:00.500
But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us, or that our logic applies to them.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.900
It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.100
Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter.

02:09.100 --> 02:13.900
You'd keep sending messages, but nobody would answer, and you'd feel pretty lonely.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.500
Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligent species,

02:17.500 --> 02:21.800
and we'll remain so until we learn to communicate properly.

02:21.900 --> 02:28.100
And even if we met aliens, we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.500
Imagine the smartest squirrel you can.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.500
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.700
After all, from the squirrel's perspective,

02:37.700 --> 02:43.100
a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.100
So humans cutting down whole forests is madness.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.200
But we don't destroy forests because we hate squirrels.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.700
We just want the resources.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.700
The squirrel's wishes and the squirrel's survival are of no concern to us.

02:55.700 --> 03:01.200
A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.300
They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.400
One of the aliens might think for a second,

03:07.400 --> 03:11.400
oh, tiny little apes, they build really cute concrete structures.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.900
Oh well, now they're dead, before activating warp speed.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.000
But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.600
it's far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics.

03:23.600 --> 03:29.100
And anyway, it would be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon.

03:29.100 --> 03:32.600
A self-replicating space probe made from nanomachines.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.400
They operate on a molecular level incredibly fast and deadly,

03:36.400 --> 03:40.500
with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.800
You only need to give them four instructions.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.600
One, find a planet with life.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.500
Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.900
Three, use the resources to build new space probes.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.300
Four, repeat.

03:54.300 --> 03:59.300
A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.400
But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide?

04:03.400 --> 04:06.000
The speed of light is actually not very fast.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
If someone could travel at the speed of light,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.400
it would still take 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way once,

04:11.400 --> 04:13.900
and you'll probably travel way slower.

04:13.900 --> 04:19.300
There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.000
An interesting concept is the matryoshka brain,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.500
a megastructure surrounding a star.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.100
A computer of such computing power,

04:27.100 --> 04:32.600
that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe.

04:32.600 --> 04:38.600
Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.800
A perfect life.

04:39.800 --> 04:45.000
If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to 10 trillion years.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.200
Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms if this were an option?

04:50.200 --> 04:53.700
All these solutions to the Fermi paradox have one problem.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.900
We don't know where the borders of technology are.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.200
We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.200
and super technology awaits us,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.900
granting us immortality,

05:03.900 --> 05:05.900
transporting us to other galaxies,

05:05.900 --> 05:08.300
elevating us to the level of gods.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.800
One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.200
Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.300
500 years ago, we thought we were the center of the universe.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.900
200 years ago, we stopped using human neighbor as the main source of energy.

05:24.900 --> 05:29.900
30 years ago, we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.700
In the galactic timescale, we are embryos.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.900
We've come far, but still have a long way to go.

05:35.900 --> 05:40.700
The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans,

05:40.700 --> 05:45.000
so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.200
But in the end, there's only one way to find out, right?

05:51.700 --> 05:55.400
Hey everybody, we finally have our own subreddit.

05:55.400 --> 06:01.200
Come by for surveys, discussions about future videos, FAQs, and stuff like that.
