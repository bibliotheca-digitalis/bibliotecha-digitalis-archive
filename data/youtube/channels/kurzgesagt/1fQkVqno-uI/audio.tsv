0	5600	There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth in the observable universe.
5600	10100	We know that there might be trillions of planets, so where are all the aliens?
10100	12300	This is the Fermi Paradox.
12300	15300	If you want to know more about it, watch Part 1.
15300	19100	Here, we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox.
19100	23400	So, will we be destroyed, or does a glorious future await us?
30000	31800	Space travel is hard.
31800	35700	Although possible, it's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars.
35700	39800	Massive amounts of material have to be put into orbit and assembled.
39800	46400	A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch.
46400	50500	And the planet might not be as hospitable as it seemed from afar.
50500	54800	It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip.
54800	58700	An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off.
58700	60700	Also, consider time.
60700	62400	The universe is very old.
62400	66600	On Earth, there's been life for at least 3.6 billion years.
66600	70400	Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years,
70400	75800	but only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances.
75800	80900	There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems
80900	85200	and existed for millions of years, and we might just have missed them.
85200	89600	There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds.
89600	93500	99% of all species on Earth have died out.
93500	97300	It's easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later.
97300	102700	Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems, and die off.
102700	104500	Over and over again.
104500	107600	But galactic civilizations might never meet,
107600	112700	so maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the universe to look at the stars and wonder,
112700	114000	where is everyone?
114000	120500	But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us, or that our logic applies to them.
120500	125900	It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated.
125900	129100	Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter.
129100	133900	You'd keep sending messages, but nobody would answer, and you'd feel pretty lonely.
133900	137500	Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligent species,
137500	141800	and we'll remain so until we learn to communicate properly.
141900	148100	And even if we met aliens, we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way.
148100	150500	Imagine the smartest squirrel you can.
150500	155500	No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it.
155500	157700	After all, from the squirrel's perspective,
157700	163100	a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive.
163100	167100	So humans cutting down whole forests is madness.
167100	170200	But we don't destroy forests because we hate squirrels.
170200	171700	We just want the resources.
171800	175700	The squirrel's wishes and the squirrel's survival are of no concern to us.
175700	181200	A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way.
181200	185300	They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier.
185300	187400	One of the aliens might think for a second,
187400	191400	oh, tiny little apes, they build really cute concrete structures.
191400	194900	Oh well, now they're dead, before activating warp speed.
194900	199000	But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species,
199000	203600	it's far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics.
203600	209100	And anyway, it would be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon.
209100	212600	A self-replicating space probe made from nanomachines.
212600	216400	They operate on a molecular level incredibly fast and deadly,
216400	220500	with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant.
220500	223800	You only need to give them four instructions.
223800	225600	One, find a planet with life.
225600	229500	Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts.
229500	232900	Three, use the resources to build new space probes.
232900	234300	Four, repeat.
234300	239300	A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years.
239300	243400	But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide?
243400	246000	The speed of light is actually not very fast.
246000	248000	If someone could travel at the speed of light,
248000	251400	it would still take 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way once,
251400	253900	and you'll probably travel way slower.
253900	259300	There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires.
259300	262000	An interesting concept is the matryoshka brain,
262000	264500	a megastructure surrounding a star.
264500	267100	A computer of such computing power,
267100	272600	that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe.
272600	278600	Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad.
278600	279800	A perfect life.
279800	285000	If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to 10 trillion years.
285000	290200	Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms if this were an option?
290200	293700	All these solutions to the Fermi paradox have one problem.
293700	296900	We don't know where the borders of technology are.
296900	300200	We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it,
300200	302200	and super technology awaits us,
302200	303900	granting us immortality,
303900	305900	transporting us to other galaxies,
305900	308300	elevating us to the level of gods.
308300	312800	One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything.
312800	317200	Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers.
317200	320300	500 years ago, we thought we were the center of the universe.
320300	324900	200 years ago, we stopped using human neighbor as the main source of energy.
324900	329900	30 years ago, we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements.
329900	332700	In the galactic timescale, we are embryos.
332700	335900	We've come far, but still have a long way to go.
335900	340700	The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans,
340700	345000	so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe.
345000	348200	But in the end, there's only one way to find out, right?
351700	355400	Hey everybody, we finally have our own subreddit.
