00:00.880 --> 00:06.800
The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know after the human brain,

00:06.800 --> 00:14.240
and yet most of us never learn how it works, or what it is. Your immune system consists of

00:14.240 --> 00:20.800
hundreds of tiny and two large organs. It has its own transport network spread throughout your body.

00:20.800 --> 00:26.560
Every day, it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army, with soldiers,

00:26.560 --> 00:31.520
captains, intelligence officers, heavy weapons, and crazy suicide bombers.

00:32.480 --> 00:39.920
It's not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is you. Your biology protecting you from

00:39.920 --> 00:44.880
the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you, and from your own perverted cells

00:44.880 --> 00:50.960
that turn into cancer. It's so manifold that it's impossible to cover in one video, so we'll make a

00:50.960 --> 00:57.200
series looking at different aspects of it. Today, what happens when your body is invaded,

00:57.200 --> 01:02.080
and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and death?

01:11.440 --> 01:17.760
It's been a normal day, when suddenly, the world explodes, and an asteroid rips the sky open.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.680
Countless alien life forms invade, ready to destroy cities and infrastructure,

01:23.680 --> 01:27.840
and eat civilians. Or, this is what your cells experience.

01:28.880 --> 01:34.720
You look at your bleeding thumb that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park. How annoying.

01:35.440 --> 01:41.840
But inside the wound, a horrible catastrophe has happened. There are dead cells and blood and dirt

01:41.840 --> 01:48.240
everywhere. Even worse, countless bacteria invade the warm caverns between your helpless cells

01:48.240 --> 01:55.200
to explore their new home, steal your resources, and poop everywhere. Immediately, the first stage

01:55.200 --> 02:02.640
of your defense kicks in. The cells that survived the impact or are hurt or dying scream in panic,

02:02.640 --> 02:06.960
releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals that awaken your immune system.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.000
The first cells to show up are macrophages. If an average cell were the size of a human,

02:14.000 --> 02:20.720
a macrophage would be the size of a black rhino. A stoic cell, in principle, but you wouldn't want

02:20.720 --> 02:28.640
to annoy it. Bacteria do annoy them. Within seconds, the large cells attack and begin

02:28.640 --> 02:34.560
killing them without mercy. They stretch out parts like the arms of an octopus and grab the bacteria

02:34.560 --> 02:41.040
to swallow them whole and digest them alive. A macrophage can eat 100 bacteria before it's

02:41.040 --> 02:47.040
exhausted. But there are too many enemies, so the macrophages call for reinforcements.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.680
In your blood, hundreds of thousands of neutrophils pick up their signals

02:51.680 --> 02:57.920
and move to the battlefield. Neutrophils are intense suicide warriors that only live to kill.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.840
They're so enthusiastic about killing that they kill themselves a few days after birth,

03:03.840 --> 03:07.600
so they don't have time to accidentally destroy your body from the inside.

03:08.640 --> 03:14.320
As soon as neutrophils arrive, they begin vomiting deadly chemicals at bacteria or devour them.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.160
They are so careless in their attacks that they are causing real damage to your own cells,

03:20.160 --> 03:27.200
but collateral damage is not their concern now. Or ever. Some neutrophils go so far to push their

03:27.200 --> 03:34.400
suicide button and explode, casting wide and toxic nets made from their own DNA filled with

03:34.400 --> 03:41.200
deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria. Sometimes they can continue fighting after that,

03:41.200 --> 03:45.440
even though they're sort of dead already. This is how much fun they have killing.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.800
While the battle rages, your blood vessels let fluid stream into the battlefield,

03:50.800 --> 03:56.400
like a dam opening up towards a valley. You notice this as inflammation. Your thumb

03:56.400 --> 04:02.320
swells up a little and gets red and warm. The fluid brings a silent killer into the battle zone,

04:02.320 --> 04:07.600
millions of complement proteins. A sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns and kills

04:07.600 --> 04:12.560
bacteria by ripping holes into them. We made a whole video explaining them in detail.

04:13.600 --> 04:19.200
We're reaching a crossroad now. If things go well, your first line of defense kills the invaders

04:19.200 --> 04:25.040
quickly. But sometimes, the enemies are too strong and would overwhelm your defenses eventually,

04:25.040 --> 04:31.200
which means certain death for you, the human. This is the hour of the dendritic cell,

04:31.200 --> 04:36.320
your immune system's intelligence officer. While your soldiers were bashing in heads,

04:36.320 --> 04:42.880
it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria into tiny parts and covering itself in it. Like

04:42.880 --> 04:49.360
a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy. The cell leaves the battlefield and enters

04:49.360 --> 04:53.760
the superhighway of your immune system that connects all your tissues with your immune

04:53.760 --> 04:59.840
headquarters, your lymph nodes. The dendritic cell coming from the battlefield is looking

04:59.840 --> 05:06.160
for a helper T-cell, which is a sort of all-purpose commander cell within your immune army. But not

05:06.160 --> 05:11.280
any helper T-cell, one that happens to have just the right weapon for the bacteria that infected

05:11.280 --> 05:17.360
your wound. So it goes around and rubs itself, still covered in bacteria parts, against every

05:17.360 --> 05:24.080
helper T-cell it meets. Most T-cells are a bit disgusted and not interested. But after a few

05:24.080 --> 05:31.680
hours, something clicks. A helper T-cell recognizes the bacteria parts. This cell is the weapon that's

05:31.680 --> 05:39.040
needed right now. The dendritic cell is overjoyed and activates the helper T-cell. Okay, wait.

05:39.680 --> 05:44.720
How come your immune system has a cell that has a weapon against the specific bacteria that

05:44.720 --> 05:50.560
infected you? Well, your immune system has a perfect weapon against every possible disease

05:50.560 --> 05:55.760
in the universe, against the Black Death, the coronavirus, or an infection that will emerge in

05:55.760 --> 06:01.840
100 years on Mars. We'll talk about this a bit more in the next video because it's very complex.

06:01.840 --> 06:07.200
So for now, just know that you have billions of unique helper T-cells that each have weapons

06:07.200 --> 06:13.600
against every possible enemy. After the right T-cell is activated, your second line of defense

06:13.600 --> 06:20.640
awakes and rises like a teenager that needs to get up on a school day, very slowly. Your heavy

06:20.640 --> 06:27.760
weapons are incredibly effective, but they're not fast. The activated helper T-cell begins to clone

06:27.760 --> 06:34.320
itself over and over again. One becomes two, two become four, until there are thousands of them.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.760
Now they split into two groups. The first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers.

06:40.400 --> 06:46.320
At the battlefield, things are getting out of hand. A tired macrophage is ready to give up.

06:46.320 --> 06:51.280
After fighting for days, it just wants to go to sleep, like many of its buddies have done already.

06:52.240 --> 06:57.760
But now the helper T-cells arrive. One of them comes to the tired macrophage and whispers

06:57.760 --> 07:03.920
something using special chemical signals. In a heartbeat, the demoralized soldier feels fresh

07:03.920 --> 07:11.520
again. But there's something else. A hot, white anger. The macrophage knows what it needs to do.

07:12.480 --> 07:19.520
Kill. Invigorated, it throws itself against the enemies once again. All over the battlefield,

07:19.520 --> 07:25.520
this begins to happen. Meanwhile, the second group of helper T-cells was working on activating

07:25.520 --> 07:32.400
another line of defense, B-cells, your antibody factories. Antibodies are protein super weapons

07:32.400 --> 07:37.840
that look like tiny crabs with two pincers to grab enemies. Just like the helper T-cells,

07:37.840 --> 07:42.320
there are B-cells in your body that are able to make just the right antibodies for every possible

07:42.320 --> 07:49.040
enemy. And the helper T-cell is looking for exactly these B-cells. After a day or two,

07:49.040 --> 07:54.800
the right B-cell is found and begins to clone itself. As soon as enough clones have been made,

07:54.800 --> 08:00.800
each B-cell begins pumping out up to 2000 antibodies per second. About a week after

08:00.800 --> 08:06.480
you injured yourself and bacteria invaded, your second line of defense finally arrives in full

08:06.480 --> 08:12.080
force. The tiny army begins to saturate the battlefield, pinching and stunning desperate

08:12.080 --> 08:18.400
bacteria. The antibodies clump them together and make them unable to move or fight, while your

08:18.400 --> 08:25.360
soldiers massacre the defenseless victims. The tide is turning fast. As the last enemies are

08:25.360 --> 08:30.160
cleaned up, your soldiers realize they are no longer needed and begin to kill themselves to

08:30.160 --> 08:38.000
save resources. But not all of them. A few helper T-cells remain and turn into memory cells. They

08:38.000 --> 08:43.440
will guard the tissue for years, making sure the same bacteria will never again gain a foothold

08:43.440 --> 08:49.840
here. Similarly, a few B-cells will stay alive and keep producing a low amount of antibodies,

08:49.840 --> 08:56.080
making you immune against this bacteria, maybe for the rest of your life. One day you wake up

08:56.080 --> 09:00.480
and notice that the wound has grown over and left nothing but a faint red mark.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.640
You were completely unaware of the drama your cells had to deal with.

09:05.520 --> 09:10.480
For you, the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance, while for millions of cells,

09:10.480 --> 09:13.440
it was a desperate fight for life and death.

09:15.600 --> 09:20.240
But this is just the beginning of the epic story that unfolds inside you every day

09:20.240 --> 09:25.760
and is told in full in Immune, a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive,

09:25.760 --> 09:30.720
written by Philip Detmer, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt. The book is a beautifully

09:30.720 --> 09:35.840
illustrated deep dive into the immune system, the most important thing you don't know enough about

09:35.840 --> 09:41.200
that will forever change how you think about your body. Written to be as simple and fun as possible,

09:41.200 --> 09:46.080
it's been an ongoing passion project for almost a decade because the immune system is just about

09:46.080 --> 09:52.640
the most amazing and fascinating topic there is. So go on a journey and get to know your own body,

09:52.640 --> 09:57.280
from mystery organs, murder universities, to the largest library in the universe.

09:57.920 --> 10:03.680
Explore how incredibly vast your immune system is and how it actually works, how it fights enemies

10:03.680 --> 10:10.240
from cancer to HIV or just the flu. Learn how you can boost it and if that's actually a good idea.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.280
The book will be out in six weeks and it would mean the world to us and Philip if you could

10:15.280 --> 10:21.360
pre-order it. Pre-ordering is super important in the world of books and in contrast to games,

10:21.360 --> 10:27.120
we can guarantee that it's actually finished and there will be no day one patch. There's a link in

10:27.120 --> 10:32.880
the description. This is the end of a decade-long personal journey and we'd love to see what you

10:32.880 --> 10:47.360
think. Thank you for watching.
