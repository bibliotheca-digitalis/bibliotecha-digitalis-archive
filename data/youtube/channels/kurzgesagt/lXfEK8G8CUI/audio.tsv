880	6800	The human immune system is the most complex biological system we know after the human brain,
6800	14240	and yet most of us never learn how it works, or what it is. Your immune system consists of
14240	20800	hundreds of tiny and two large organs. It has its own transport network spread throughout your body.
20800	26560	Every day, it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army, with soldiers,
26560	31520	captains, intelligence officers, heavy weapons, and crazy suicide bombers.
32480	39920	It's not some sort of abstract entity. Your immune system is you. Your biology protecting you from
39920	44880	the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you, and from your own perverted cells
44880	50960	that turn into cancer. It's so manifold that it's impossible to cover in one video, so we'll make a
50960	57200	series looking at different aspects of it. Today, what happens when your body is invaded,
57200	62080	and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and death?
71440	77760	It's been a normal day, when suddenly, the world explodes, and an asteroid rips the sky open.
78640	83680	Countless alien life forms invade, ready to destroy cities and infrastructure,
83680	87840	and eat civilians. Or, this is what your cells experience.
88880	94720	You look at your bleeding thumb that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park. How annoying.
95440	101840	But inside the wound, a horrible catastrophe has happened. There are dead cells and blood and dirt
101840	108240	everywhere. Even worse, countless bacteria invade the warm caverns between your helpless cells
108240	115200	to explore their new home, steal your resources, and poop everywhere. Immediately, the first stage
115200	122640	of your defense kicks in. The cells that survived the impact or are hurt or dying scream in panic,
122640	126960	releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals that awaken your immune system.
127680	134000	The first cells to show up are macrophages. If an average cell were the size of a human,
134000	140720	a macrophage would be the size of a black rhino. A stoic cell, in principle, but you wouldn't want
140720	148640	to annoy it. Bacteria do annoy them. Within seconds, the large cells attack and begin
148640	154560	killing them without mercy. They stretch out parts like the arms of an octopus and grab the bacteria
154560	161040	to swallow them whole and digest them alive. A macrophage can eat 100 bacteria before it's
161040	167040	exhausted. But there are too many enemies, so the macrophages call for reinforcements.
167680	171680	In your blood, hundreds of thousands of neutrophils pick up their signals
171680	177920	and move to the battlefield. Neutrophils are intense suicide warriors that only live to kill.
178560	183840	They're so enthusiastic about killing that they kill themselves a few days after birth,
183840	187600	so they don't have time to accidentally destroy your body from the inside.
188640	194320	As soon as neutrophils arrive, they begin vomiting deadly chemicals at bacteria or devour them.
195040	200160	They are so careless in their attacks that they are causing real damage to your own cells,
200160	207200	but collateral damage is not their concern now. Or ever. Some neutrophils go so far to push their
207200	214400	suicide button and explode, casting wide and toxic nets made from their own DNA filled with
214400	221200	deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria. Sometimes they can continue fighting after that,
221200	225440	even though they're sort of dead already. This is how much fun they have killing.
226400	230800	While the battle rages, your blood vessels let fluid stream into the battlefield,
230800	236400	like a dam opening up towards a valley. You notice this as inflammation. Your thumb
236400	242320	swells up a little and gets red and warm. The fluid brings a silent killer into the battle zone,
242320	247600	millions of complement proteins. A sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns and kills
247600	252560	bacteria by ripping holes into them. We made a whole video explaining them in detail.
253600	259200	We're reaching a crossroad now. If things go well, your first line of defense kills the invaders
259200	265040	quickly. But sometimes, the enemies are too strong and would overwhelm your defenses eventually,
265040	271200	which means certain death for you, the human. This is the hour of the dendritic cell,
271200	276320	your immune system's intelligence officer. While your soldiers were bashing in heads,
276320	282880	it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria into tiny parts and covering itself in it. Like
282880	289360	a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy. The cell leaves the battlefield and enters
289360	293760	the superhighway of your immune system that connects all your tissues with your immune
293760	299840	headquarters, your lymph nodes. The dendritic cell coming from the battlefield is looking
299840	306160	for a helper T-cell, which is a sort of all-purpose commander cell within your immune army. But not
306160	311280	any helper T-cell, one that happens to have just the right weapon for the bacteria that infected
311280	317360	your wound. So it goes around and rubs itself, still covered in bacteria parts, against every
317360	324080	helper T-cell it meets. Most T-cells are a bit disgusted and not interested. But after a few
324080	331680	hours, something clicks. A helper T-cell recognizes the bacteria parts. This cell is the weapon that's
331680	339040	needed right now. The dendritic cell is overjoyed and activates the helper T-cell. Okay, wait.
339680	344720	How come your immune system has a cell that has a weapon against the specific bacteria that
344720	350560	infected you? Well, your immune system has a perfect weapon against every possible disease
350560	355760	in the universe, against the Black Death, the coronavirus, or an infection that will emerge in
355760	361840	100 years on Mars. We'll talk about this a bit more in the next video because it's very complex.
361840	367200	So for now, just know that you have billions of unique helper T-cells that each have weapons
367200	373600	against every possible enemy. After the right T-cell is activated, your second line of defense
373600	380640	awakes and rises like a teenager that needs to get up on a school day, very slowly. Your heavy
380640	387760	weapons are incredibly effective, but they're not fast. The activated helper T-cell begins to clone
387760	394320	itself over and over again. One becomes two, two become four, until there are thousands of them.
394320	399760	Now they split into two groups. The first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers.
400400	406320	At the battlefield, things are getting out of hand. A tired macrophage is ready to give up.
406320	411280	After fighting for days, it just wants to go to sleep, like many of its buddies have done already.
412240	417760	But now the helper T-cells arrive. One of them comes to the tired macrophage and whispers
417760	423920	something using special chemical signals. In a heartbeat, the demoralized soldier feels fresh
423920	431520	again. But there's something else. A hot, white anger. The macrophage knows what it needs to do.
432480	439520	Kill. Invigorated, it throws itself against the enemies once again. All over the battlefield,
439520	445520	this begins to happen. Meanwhile, the second group of helper T-cells was working on activating
445520	452400	another line of defense, B-cells, your antibody factories. Antibodies are protein super weapons
452400	457840	that look like tiny crabs with two pincers to grab enemies. Just like the helper T-cells,
457840	462320	there are B-cells in your body that are able to make just the right antibodies for every possible
462320	469040	enemy. And the helper T-cell is looking for exactly these B-cells. After a day or two,
469040	474800	the right B-cell is found and begins to clone itself. As soon as enough clones have been made,
474800	480800	each B-cell begins pumping out up to 2000 antibodies per second. About a week after
480800	486480	you injured yourself and bacteria invaded, your second line of defense finally arrives in full
486480	492080	force. The tiny army begins to saturate the battlefield, pinching and stunning desperate
492080	498400	bacteria. The antibodies clump them together and make them unable to move or fight, while your
498400	505360	soldiers massacre the defenseless victims. The tide is turning fast. As the last enemies are
505360	510160	cleaned up, your soldiers realize they are no longer needed and begin to kill themselves to
510160	518000	save resources. But not all of them. A few helper T-cells remain and turn into memory cells. They
518000	523440	will guard the tissue for years, making sure the same bacteria will never again gain a foothold
523440	529840	here. Similarly, a few B-cells will stay alive and keep producing a low amount of antibodies,
529840	536080	making you immune against this bacteria, maybe for the rest of your life. One day you wake up
536080	540480	and notice that the wound has grown over and left nothing but a faint red mark.
541200	544640	You were completely unaware of the drama your cells had to deal with.
545520	550480	For you, the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance, while for millions of cells,
550480	553440	it was a desperate fight for life and death.
555600	560240	But this is just the beginning of the epic story that unfolds inside you every day
560240	565760	and is told in full in Immune, a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive,
565760	570720	written by Philip Detmer, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt. The book is a beautifully
570720	575840	illustrated deep dive into the immune system, the most important thing you don't know enough about
575840	581200	that will forever change how you think about your body. Written to be as simple and fun as possible,
581200	586080	it's been an ongoing passion project for almost a decade because the immune system is just about
586080	592640	the most amazing and fascinating topic there is. So go on a journey and get to know your own body,
592640	597280	from mystery organs, murder universities, to the largest library in the universe.
597920	603680	Explore how incredibly vast your immune system is and how it actually works, how it fights enemies
603680	610240	from cancer to HIV or just the flu. Learn how you can boost it and if that's actually a good idea.
611040	615280	The book will be out in six weeks and it would mean the world to us and Philip if you could
615280	621360	pre-order it. Pre-ordering is super important in the world of books and in contrast to games,
621360	627120	we can guarantee that it's actually finished and there will be no day one patch. There's a link in
627120	632880	the description. This is the end of a decade-long personal journey and we'd love to see what you
632880	647360	think. Thank you for watching.
