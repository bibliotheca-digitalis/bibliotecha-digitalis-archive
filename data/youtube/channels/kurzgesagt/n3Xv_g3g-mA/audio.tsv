800	3000	Everybody feels lonely from time to time.
3840	8040	When we have no one to sit next to at lunch, when we move to a new city,
8600	11400	or when nobody has time for us at the weekend.
12240	17280	But over the last few decades, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.
17800	23520	In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year olds say they often feel lonely.
24440	29580	In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.
30720	34160	We are living in the most connected time in human history.
34560	38480	And yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.
39840	42840	Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.
43400	47720	You can be filled with bliss by yourself and hate every second surrounded by friends.
49080	53040	Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.
53520	56160	If you feel lonely, you are lonely.
57080	64040	A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people or how to behave around others.
65200	72120	But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections.
73440	75440	Loneliness can affect everybody.
75480	80480	Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personality.
81320	85960	Nothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.
86160	94160	Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.
95000	97960	Hunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.
98600	101680	Loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.
103040	110160	Your body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago, it was a greater indicator of how likely you were to survive.
111000	116600	Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections with each other.
117360	125560	Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt and to form and sustain social bonds.
126360	129280	Being social became part of our biology.
129960	135760	You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.
136760	143440	Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.
144040	148280	Being together meant survival. Being alone meant death.
149120	151560	So it was crucial that you got along with others.
152400	157440	For your ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,
157640	161840	but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.
162680	165880	To avoid that, your body came up with social pain.
166360	170680	Pain of this kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.
171320	176040	A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behavior that would isolate you.
177080	184040	Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behavior when they got rejected and
184200	189360	thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died.
190360	196120	That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.
196880	205280	These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history until humans began building a new world for themselves.
209520	213880	The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance.
214480	217360	Western culture began to focus on the individual.
218200	225240	Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.
226040	228840	This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.
230000	232880	People left their villages and fields to enter factories.
234520	239840	Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew.
240720	245640	As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more.
246640	254040	Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind.
254720	259200	We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past.
260040	266520	In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from three in 1985 to two in 2011.
267960	274320	Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work,
275000	277760	university, romance, kids, and Netflix.
278160	284600	There's just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends.
285720	289040	Until you wake up one day and realize that you feel isolated,
290280	292680	that you yearn for close relationships.
293240	299120	But it's hard to find close connections as adults, and so loneliness can become chronic.
300120	307720	While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were
308160	310000	50,000 years ago.
310000	313720	We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.
318000	325520	Large-scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans.
326120	329760	It makes you age quicker, it makes cancer deadlier,
330440	333880	Alzheimer's advance faster, your immune systems weaker.
334880	340960	Loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.
342240	347520	The most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic, it can become self-sustaining.
349120	352520	Physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain.
352880	360520	Both feel like a threat, and so social pain leads to immediate and defensive behavior when it's inflicted on you.
361280	369480	When loneliness becomes chronic, your brain goes into self-preservation mode. It starts to see danger and hostility everywhere.
370160	372120	But that's not all.
372120	377760	Some studies found that when you're lonely, your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals,
377920	381880	while at the same time it gets worse at interpreting them correctly.
382680	385880	You pay more attention to others, but you understand them less.
386320	394400	The part of your brain that recognizes faces gets out of tune and becomes more likely to categorize neutral faces as hostile,
394440	396440	which makes it distrustful of others.
397520	401200	Loneliness makes you assume the worst about others' intentions towards you.
402200	408240	Because of this perceived hostile world, you can become more self-centered to protect yourself,
409040	413920	which can make you appear more cold, unfriendly, and socially awkward than you really are.
418920	421920	If loneliness has become a strong presence in your life,
421960	426480	the first thing you can do is to try to recognize the vicious cycle you may be trapped in.
427320	429520	It usually goes something like this.
430240	433840	An initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness,
434040	438440	which makes you focus your attention selectively on negative interactions with others.
439160	442920	This makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative,
443520	450680	which then changes your behavior. You begin to avoid social interaction, which leads to more feelings of isolation.
451560	455640	This cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time.
456880	459480	Loneliness makes you sit far away from others in class,
460080	465480	not answer the phone when friends call, decline invitations until the invitations stop.
466040	469160	Each and every one of us has a story about ourselves,
469280	474240	and if your story becomes that people exclude you, others pick up on that,
474840	478080	and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it.
478880	486520	This is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression and a mental state that prevents
486560	488720	connections even if you yearn for them.
489600	496880	The first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of.
498080	503600	Literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life. It's a universal human experience.
504400	508720	You can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically,
508800	512840	but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of its cause.
513720	520680	You can self-examine what you focus your attention on and check if you are selectively concentrating on negative things.
521320	524120	Was this interaction with a colleague really negative?
524760	527400	Or was it really neutral or even positive?
528360	530960	What was the actual content of an interaction?
531040	537560	What did the other person say and did they say something bad or did you add extra meaning to their words?
537560	543400	Maybe another person was not really reacting negatively, but just short on time.
544480	549800	Then there are your thoughts about the world. Are you assuming the worst about others' intentions?
550080	554400	Do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go?
555000	557040	Do you assume others don't want you around?
558080	562000	Are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up?
562000	566080	And if so, can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt?
566760	572800	Can you just assume that they're not against you? Can you risk being open and vulnerable again?
573680	575680	And lastly, your behavior.
576040	582520	Are you avoiding opportunities to be around others? Are you looking for excuses to decline invitations?
583240	587120	Or are you pushing others away preemptively to protect yourself?
587720	595280	Are you acting as if you're getting attacked? Are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with your situation?
596400	603760	Of course, every person and situation is unique and different, and just introspection alone might not be enough.
604120	610120	If you feel unable to solve your situation by yourself, please try to reach out and get professional help.
610400	613200	It's not a sign of weakness, but of courage.
613920	620520	However we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to create more personal happiness,
620520	624960	or as a public health crisis, it is something that deserves more attention.
625720	628720	Humans have built a world that's nothing short of amazing,
628720	637080	and yet none of the shiny things we've made is able to satisfy or substitute our fundamental biological need for connection.
637880	643400	Most animals get what they need from their physical surroundings. We get what we need from each other.
644080	647560	And we need to build our artificial human world based on that.
647560	656320	Let's try something together. Let's reach out to someone today.
656320	662360	Regardless if you feel a little bit lonely, or if you want to make someone else's day better.
662360	668160	Maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Call a family member who's become estranged.
668160	674200	Invite a work buddy for a coffee. Or just go to something you're usually too afraid to go to,
674240	678240	or too lazy to go to, like a D&D event or a sports club.
678240	681520	Everybody's different, so you know what's a good fit for you.
681520	687520	Maybe nothing will come of it, and that's okay. Don't do this with any expectations.
687520	694520	The goal is just to open up a bit. To exercise your connection muscles, so they can grow stronger over time.
694520	697520	Or to help others exercise them.
697520	702520	We want to recommend two of the books we read while researching this video.
702840	707840	Emotional First Aid by Guy Winch. A book that addresses, among other topics,
707840	711840	how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionable.
711840	718840	And Loneliness, Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John Cacioppo and William Patrick.
718840	725840	It's an entertaining and scientific exploration as to why we experience loneliness on a biological level,
725840	730840	how it's spread in society, and what science has to say about how to escape it.
730840	734160	Links for both books in the video description.
