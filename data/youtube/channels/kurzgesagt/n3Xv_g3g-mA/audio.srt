1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,000
Everybody feels lonely from time to time.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,040
When we have no one to sit next to at lunch, when we move to a new city,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,400
or when nobody has time for us at the weekend.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,280
But over the last few decades, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,520
In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year olds say they often feel lonely.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,580
In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
We are living in the most connected time in human history.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,480
And yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,720
You can be filled with bliss by yourself and hate every second surrounded by friends.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,040
Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
If you feel lonely, you are lonely.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,040
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people or how to behave around others.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,120
But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Loneliness can affect everybody.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personality.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,960
Nothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,960
Hunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,680
Loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,160
Your body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago, it was a greater indicator of how likely you were to survive.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections with each other.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,560
Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt and to form and sustain social bonds.

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,280
Being social became part of our biology.

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,760
You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,440
Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,280
Being together meant survival. Being alone meant death.

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,560
So it was crucial that you got along with others.

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
For your ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,840
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,880
To avoid that, your body came up with social pain.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,680
Pain of this kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,040
A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behavior that would isolate you.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,040
Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behavior when they got rejected and

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,360
thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,120
That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,280
These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history until humans began building a new world for themselves.

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,880
The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Western culture began to focus on the individual.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:45,240
Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.

41
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,840
This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,880
People left their villages and fields to enter factories.

43
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew.

44
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,640
As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more.

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,040
Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind.

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,200
We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past.

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,520
In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from three in 1985 to two in 2011.

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,320
Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work,

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,760
university, romance, kids, and Netflix.

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,600
There's just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends.

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,040
Until you wake up one day and realize that you feel isolated,

52
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
that you yearn for close relationships.

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,120
But it's hard to find close connections as adults, and so loneliness can become chronic.

54
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,720
While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
50,000 years ago.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,720
We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,520
Large-scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans.

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,760
It makes you age quicker, it makes cancer deadlier,

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,880
Alzheimer's advance faster, your immune systems weaker.

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,960
Loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.

61
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,520
The most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic, it can become self-sustaining.

62
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,520
Physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain.

63
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,520
Both feel like a threat, and so social pain leads to immediate and defensive behavior when it's inflicted on you.

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:09,480
When loneliness becomes chronic, your brain goes into self-preservation mode. It starts to see danger and hostility everywhere.

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,120
But that's not all.

66
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Some studies found that when you're lonely, your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals,

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,880
while at the same time it gets worse at interpreting them correctly.

68
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,880
You pay more attention to others, but you understand them less.

69
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,400
The part of your brain that recognizes faces gets out of tune and becomes more likely to categorize neutral faces as hostile,

70
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
which makes it distrustful of others.

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,200
Loneliness makes you assume the worst about others' intentions towards you.

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,240
Because of this perceived hostile world, you can become more self-centered to protect yourself,

73
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,920
which can make you appear more cold, unfriendly, and socially awkward than you really are.

74
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,920
If loneliness has become a strong presence in your life,

75
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,480
the first thing you can do is to try to recognize the vicious cycle you may be trapped in.

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,520
It usually goes something like this.

77
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
An initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness,

78
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,440
which makes you focus your attention selectively on negative interactions with others.

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,920
This makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative,

80
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,680
which then changes your behavior. You begin to avoid social interaction, which leads to more feelings of isolation.

81
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,640
This cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time.

82
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,480
Loneliness makes you sit far away from others in class,

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,480
not answer the phone when friends call, decline invitations until the invitations stop.

84
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,160
Each and every one of us has a story about ourselves,

85
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,240
and if your story becomes that people exclude you, others pick up on that,

86
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,080
and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it.

87
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,520
This is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression and a mental state that prevents

88
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
connections even if you yearn for them.

89
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,880
The first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of.

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,600
Literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life. It's a universal human experience.

91
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,720
You can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically,

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,840
but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of its cause.

93
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:40,680
You can self-examine what you focus your attention on and check if you are selectively concentrating on negative things.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Was this interaction with a colleague really negative?

95
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,400
Or was it really neutral or even positive?

96
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,960
What was the actual content of an interaction?

97
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,560
What did the other person say and did they say something bad or did you add extra meaning to their words?

98
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,400
Maybe another person was not really reacting negatively, but just short on time.

99
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,800
Then there are your thoughts about the world. Are you assuming the worst about others' intentions?

100
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go?

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,040
Do you assume others don't want you around?

102
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up?

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
And if so, can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt?

104
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,800
Can you just assume that they're not against you? Can you risk being open and vulnerable again?

105
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
And lastly, your behavior.

106
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,520
Are you avoiding opportunities to be around others? Are you looking for excuses to decline invitations?

107
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Or are you pushing others away preemptively to protect yourself?

108
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,280
Are you acting as if you're getting attacked? Are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with your situation?

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,760
Of course, every person and situation is unique and different, and just introspection alone might not be enough.

110
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,120
If you feel unable to solve your situation by yourself, please try to reach out and get professional help.

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,200
It's not a sign of weakness, but of courage.

112
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,520
However we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to create more personal happiness,

113
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,960
or as a public health crisis, it is something that deserves more attention.

114
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Humans have built a world that's nothing short of amazing,

115
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:37,080
and yet none of the shiny things we've made is able to satisfy or substitute our fundamental biological need for connection.

116
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Most animals get what they need from their physical surroundings. We get what we need from each other.

117
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,560
And we need to build our artificial human world based on that.

118
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:56,320
Let's try something together. Let's reach out to someone today.

119
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,360
Regardless if you feel a little bit lonely, or if you want to make someone else's day better.

120
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,160
Maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Call a family member who's become estranged.

121
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,200
Invite a work buddy for a coffee. Or just go to something you're usually too afraid to go to,

122
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
or too lazy to go to, like a D&D event or a sports club.

123
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,520
Everybody's different, so you know what's a good fit for you.

124
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Maybe nothing will come of it, and that's okay. Don't do this with any expectations.

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,520
The goal is just to open up a bit. To exercise your connection muscles, so they can grow stronger over time.

126
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Or to help others exercise them.

127
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,520
We want to recommend two of the books we read while researching this video.

128
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Emotional First Aid by Guy Winch. A book that addresses, among other topics,

129
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,840
how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionable.

130
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,840
And Loneliness, Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John Cacioppo and William Patrick.

131
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,840
It's an entertaining and scientific exploration as to why we experience loneliness on a biological level,

132
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,840
how it's spread in society, and what science has to say about how to escape it.

133
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,160
Links for both books in the video description.
