00:00.800 --> 00:03.000
Everybody feels lonely from time to time.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.040
When we have no one to sit next to at lunch, when we move to a new city,

00:08.600 --> 00:11.400
or when nobody has time for us at the weekend.

00:12.240 --> 00:17.280
But over the last few decades, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.520
In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year olds say they often feel lonely.

00:24.440 --> 00:29.580
In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.160
We are living in the most connected time in human history.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.480
And yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.840
Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.720
You can be filled with bliss by yourself and hate every second surrounded by friends.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.040
Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.160
If you feel lonely, you are lonely.

00:57.080 --> 01:04.040
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people or how to behave around others.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.120
But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.440
Loneliness can affect everybody.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.480
Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personality.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.960
Nothing can protect you against loneliness because it's part of your biology.

01:26.160 --> 01:34.160
Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.960
Hunger makes you pay attention to your physical needs.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.680
Loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.

01:43.040 --> 01:50.160
Your body cares about your social needs because millions of years ago, it was a greater indicator of how likely you were to survive.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.600
Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration and for forming connections with each other.

01:57.360 --> 02:05.560
Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt and to form and sustain social bonds.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.280
Being social became part of our biology.

02:09.960 --> 02:15.760
You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.

02:16.760 --> 02:23.440
Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.280
Being together meant survival. Being alone meant death.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.560
So it was crucial that you got along with others.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.440
For your ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion,

02:37.640 --> 02:41.840
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.880
To avoid that, your body came up with social pain.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.680
Pain of this kind is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.040
A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behavior that would isolate you.

02:57.080 --> 03:04.040
Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behavior when they got rejected and

03:04.200 --> 03:09.360
thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died.

03:10.360 --> 03:16.120
That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.

03:16.880 --> 03:25.280
These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history until humans began building a new world for themselves.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.880
The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.360
Western culture began to focus on the individual.

03:38.200 --> 03:45.240
Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.840
This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.880
People left their villages and fields to enter factories.

03:54.520 --> 03:59.840
Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.640
As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more.

04:06.640 --> 04:14.040
Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind.

04:14.720 --> 04:19.200
We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past.

04:20.040 --> 04:26.520
In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from three in 1985 to two in 2011.

04:27.960 --> 04:34.320
Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.760
university, romance, kids, and Netflix.

04:38.160 --> 04:44.600
There's just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.040
Until you wake up one day and realize that you feel isolated,

04:50.280 --> 04:52.680
that you yearn for close relationships.

04:53.240 --> 04:59.120
But it's hard to find close connections as adults, and so loneliness can become chronic.

05:00.120 --> 05:07.720
While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were

05:08.160 --> 05:10.000
50,000 years ago.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.720
We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.520
Large-scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.760
It makes you age quicker, it makes cancer deadlier,

05:30.440 --> 05:33.880
Alzheimer's advance faster, your immune systems weaker.

05:34.880 --> 05:40.960
Loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.

05:42.240 --> 05:47.520
The most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic, it can become self-sustaining.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.520
Physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain.

05:52.880 --> 06:00.520
Both feel like a threat, and so social pain leads to immediate and defensive behavior when it's inflicted on you.

06:01.280 --> 06:09.480
When loneliness becomes chronic, your brain goes into self-preservation mode. It starts to see danger and hostility everywhere.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.120
But that's not all.

06:12.120 --> 06:17.760
Some studies found that when you're lonely, your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals,

06:17.920 --> 06:21.880
while at the same time it gets worse at interpreting them correctly.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.880
You pay more attention to others, but you understand them less.

06:26.320 --> 06:34.400
The part of your brain that recognizes faces gets out of tune and becomes more likely to categorize neutral faces as hostile,

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
which makes it distrustful of others.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.200
Loneliness makes you assume the worst about others' intentions towards you.

06:42.200 --> 06:48.240
Because of this perceived hostile world, you can become more self-centered to protect yourself,

06:49.040 --> 06:53.920
which can make you appear more cold, unfriendly, and socially awkward than you really are.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.920
If loneliness has become a strong presence in your life,

07:01.960 --> 07:06.480
the first thing you can do is to try to recognize the vicious cycle you may be trapped in.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.520
It usually goes something like this.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.840
An initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness,

07:14.040 --> 07:18.440
which makes you focus your attention selectively on negative interactions with others.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.920
This makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative,

07:23.520 --> 07:30.680
which then changes your behavior. You begin to avoid social interaction, which leads to more feelings of isolation.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.640
This cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.480
Loneliness makes you sit far away from others in class,

07:40.080 --> 07:45.480
not answer the phone when friends call, decline invitations until the invitations stop.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.160
Each and every one of us has a story about ourselves,

07:49.280 --> 07:54.240
and if your story becomes that people exclude you, others pick up on that,

07:54.840 --> 07:58.080
and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it.

07:58.880 --> 08:06.520
This is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression and a mental state that prevents

08:06.560 --> 08:08.720
connections even if you yearn for them.

08:09.600 --> 08:16.880
The first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.600
Literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life. It's a universal human experience.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.720
You can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically,

08:28.800 --> 08:32.840
but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of its cause.

08:33.720 --> 08:40.680
You can self-examine what you focus your attention on and check if you are selectively concentrating on negative things.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.120
Was this interaction with a colleague really negative?

08:44.760 --> 08:47.400
Or was it really neutral or even positive?

08:48.360 --> 08:50.960
What was the actual content of an interaction?

08:51.040 --> 08:57.560
What did the other person say and did they say something bad or did you add extra meaning to their words?

08:57.560 --> 09:03.400
Maybe another person was not really reacting negatively, but just short on time.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.800
Then there are your thoughts about the world. Are you assuming the worst about others' intentions?

09:10.080 --> 09:14.400
Do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.040
Do you assume others don't want you around?

09:18.080 --> 09:22.000
Are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.080
And if so, can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt?

09:26.760 --> 09:32.800
Can you just assume that they're not against you? Can you risk being open and vulnerable again?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.680
And lastly, your behavior.

09:36.040 --> 09:42.520
Are you avoiding opportunities to be around others? Are you looking for excuses to decline invitations?

09:43.240 --> 09:47.120
Or are you pushing others away preemptively to protect yourself?

09:47.720 --> 09:55.280
Are you acting as if you're getting attacked? Are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with your situation?

09:56.400 --> 10:03.760
Of course, every person and situation is unique and different, and just introspection alone might not be enough.

10:04.120 --> 10:10.120
If you feel unable to solve your situation by yourself, please try to reach out and get professional help.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.200
It's not a sign of weakness, but of courage.

10:13.920 --> 10:20.520
However we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to create more personal happiness,

10:20.520 --> 10:24.960
or as a public health crisis, it is something that deserves more attention.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.720
Humans have built a world that's nothing short of amazing,

10:28.720 --> 10:37.080
and yet none of the shiny things we've made is able to satisfy or substitute our fundamental biological need for connection.

10:37.880 --> 10:43.400
Most animals get what they need from their physical surroundings. We get what we need from each other.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.560
And we need to build our artificial human world based on that.

10:47.560 --> 10:56.320
Let's try something together. Let's reach out to someone today.

10:56.320 --> 11:02.360
Regardless if you feel a little bit lonely, or if you want to make someone else's day better.

11:02.360 --> 11:08.160
Maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Call a family member who's become estranged.

11:08.160 --> 11:14.200
Invite a work buddy for a coffee. Or just go to something you're usually too afraid to go to,

11:14.240 --> 11:18.240
or too lazy to go to, like a D&D event or a sports club.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.520
Everybody's different, so you know what's a good fit for you.

11:21.520 --> 11:27.520
Maybe nothing will come of it, and that's okay. Don't do this with any expectations.

11:27.520 --> 11:34.520
The goal is just to open up a bit. To exercise your connection muscles, so they can grow stronger over time.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.520
Or to help others exercise them.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.520
We want to recommend two of the books we read while researching this video.

11:42.840 --> 11:47.840
Emotional First Aid by Guy Winch. A book that addresses, among other topics,

11:47.840 --> 11:51.840
how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and actionable.

11:51.840 --> 11:58.840
And Loneliness, Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John Cacioppo and William Patrick.

11:58.840 --> 12:05.840
It's an entertaining and scientific exploration as to why we experience loneliness on a biological level,

12:05.840 --> 12:10.840
how it's spread in society, and what science has to say about how to escape it.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.160
Links for both books in the video description.
