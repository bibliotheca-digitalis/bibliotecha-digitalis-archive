1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you're occupying?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city, on a continent, on a planet, orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But where is all of that?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The space we occupy is not like a stage under our feet.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We can't mark specific points or staple something to space-time as an anchor.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Without things, there is no position.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We are really ever only at a position in relation to something else.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Which also means that things we take for granted, like up and down, are actually relative, too.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, let's fill the universe up with things again and try to find out where you are right now, relative to everything else.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's start this video at a familiar place and then get increasingly weird.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
From your perspective, the world is seemingly flat, and you can move in three dimensions.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's what physicists call a frame of reference, the perspective you have of the universe and how you see things moving around you, where your up and down is.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Your frame of reference is correct for you, but not for the rest of the universe.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Around five kilometers from you, where the horizon begins, the ground noticeably curves away from you.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you could see through the ground, you'd see people from below or sideways.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But they don't fall down off the planet because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Down is an illusion of your reference frame.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To Earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But for humans, there is an up and down, because within our frame of reference, that just makes sense.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Which is also why we think that the planet itself has an up and down, north and south, and we made our maps accordingly.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But an observer looking at the solar system might disagree.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Our maps make sense to us because we're used to them, not because they are correct.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, so this is step one. Your position on what feels like a flat surface, but is actually a sphere.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But this sphere is always moving, never staying in one position.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Earth is orbiting a star, the Sun at the center of the solar system.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
While we usually imagine this is pretty orderly, someone looking at us from the outside would see something pretty messy.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
To see this more clearly, we'll exaggerate all these movements. This is not to scale.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse, so we spend half the year sinking a little bit closer to the Sun,

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
speeding up, and half the year rising up a bit and slowing down.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the ellipse itself changes its shape every 100,000 years too.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the ellipse itself is drifting, which at least creates a beautiful shape.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In the end, we get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly circle with wavy edges.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It gets worse as the Moon now starts to mess things up too.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
As the Moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on Earth.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Both objects orbit their common center of gravity that lies around 4,700 kilometers off to the side of Earth's core.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In practice, this means that as the Moon orbits Earth, it's jerking Earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so you're standing on the surface of a rotating planet that is jiggling around the Sun in an elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But who's to say the Earth is right?

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
From the perspective of the Sun, the plane of the solar system is arbitrary.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's defined as the plane the Earth orbits in because that is convenient for us.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In reality, the other planets are just a little bit inclined with respect to our plane.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
From their point of view, we're the ones with a slightly bent orbit.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But this isn't it. Far from it.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The solar system as a whole is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If we look at the Milky Way, we can clearly make out a galactic plane in which the solar system orbits the center every 230 million years.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But of course, it's not that simple.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
First of all, the plane of the solar system is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Nothing really is.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just like the planets in the solar system orbit the Sun on their own planes, so do all the stars orbiting the galactic center.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees towards the galactic plane,

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
speeding through space at almost a million kilometers per hour.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Someone in the center of the galaxy would see the orbits of the planets moving through space in a helix shape,

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which you can imagine as a corkscrew motion on the tilted plane of the solar system relative to the plane of the galaxy.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This orientation in space means that sometimes the planets are sort of in front of the Sun as it orbits around the galactic core.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's just look at this for a moment.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is a strange and eerie beauty about how our planets and the Sun move through space.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is still not the whole story because the mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on the solar system too.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like a drunk dolphin, we're diving down and shooting up hundreds of light years through the galactic plane ten times every orbit,

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
along arcs thousands of light years long.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We haven't mapped this motion out completely, as it takes the solar system tens of millions of years to go up and back once,

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and well, humanity is not that old.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's look at your relative position again.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
On a planet tilted towards the Sun, jiggled around by the Moon,

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the solar system tilted towards the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical shape, diving up and down through the plane.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hmm, but where is up in a galaxy?

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
At this point, the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary and pointless because of the nature of the universe at this scale.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The Milky Way is part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of greater structures like the Laniakea supercluster,

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces-Cetus supercluster complex,

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and finally a galactic filament that spans hundreds of millions of light years in all directions and orientations.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Someone looking right at us from that far away will only see the end of greatness.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All stuff appears homogeneous, the same everywhere.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just like with empty space, when everything looks the same, who's to say anyone's view is better than anyone else's?

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We've reached the end of our little exercise in cosmic humidity.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's make the journey backwards again, from the indescribably large, to the really large, to our galactic home, to our galaxy,

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to the solar system diving up and down through the Milky Way, to the jiggle of existence.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And finally, back to you right now, watching this video.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If this is all a bit much, don't feel bad.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The scale of the universe is brain-crushing,

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and trying to keep track of how everything is oriented or decide where the best up and down is, is hard.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But it doesn't really matter, because it doesn't change where you are.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're already in the best spot you possibly could be.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right here, right now.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
For all you care, nothing can stop you from being right at the center of your own little universe.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Perspective really is everything.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's true for the universe we all inhabit, but even more so within your personal universe.

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The way your life will unfold also depends on what you consider possible.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Take us at Kurzgesagt.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Our passion is to spark curiosity for science and make videos for free.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But this is not a great business model, so we began to create our own lines of science posters, calendars and fun Kurzgesagt merch,

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
pieces of Kurzgesagt that you can take home and touch.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And we're doing this with Shopify, who were also so kind as to sponsor this video,

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
which delighted us because we've been using their platform for years now.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Shopify is an e-commerce platform that allows you to start and grow your business.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And by starting a business, we really do mean from scratch.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you want to sell your handmade ceramic mugs out of your bedroom today, you can.

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But not just that, if you want to scale your one-man show to a sizable team,

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
then Shopify has the tools to support you on your journey.

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now you just have to get started.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Go to Shopify.com slash Kurzgesagt to get a free 14-day trial.

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you think that this idea doesn't apply to you and your ideas are too small,

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
we want to encourage you to think again.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The first video on this channel was a university project and Kurzgesagt itself was a creative outlet.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Eventually, we grew into a business and the team that is making videos for you today.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And all of that just because we wanted to try out something new.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is exactly the sort of thing that Shopify is determined to support and you can build your own thing with it.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
After all, whether your idea is still just a dream or might turn into a plan today is also just a matter of perspective.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Millions of businesses in over 175 countries are currently using Shopify to sell their products and we are one of them.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thanks to them for helping us get here and thanks to all of you for making our channel possible.
