00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you're occupying?

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city, on a continent, on a planet, orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
But where is all of that?

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
The space we occupy is not like a stage under our feet.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
We can't mark specific points or staple something to space-time as an anchor.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Without things, there is no position.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
We are really ever only at a position in relation to something else.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Which also means that things we take for granted, like up and down, are actually relative, too.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay, let's fill the universe up with things again and try to find out where you are right now, relative to everything else.

01:13.000 --> 01:28.000
Let's start this video at a familiar place and then get increasingly weird.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
From your perspective, the world is seemingly flat, and you can move in three dimensions.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
It's what physicists call a frame of reference, the perspective you have of the universe and how you see things moving around you, where your up and down is.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Your frame of reference is correct for you, but not for the rest of the universe.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Around five kilometers from you, where the horizon begins, the ground noticeably curves away from you.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
If you could see through the ground, you'd see people from below or sideways.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
But they don't fall down off the planet because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Down is an illusion of your reference frame.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
To Earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
But for humans, there is an up and down, because within our frame of reference, that just makes sense.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Which is also why we think that the planet itself has an up and down, north and south, and we made our maps accordingly.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
But an observer looking at the solar system might disagree.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Our maps make sense to us because we're used to them, not because they are correct.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
Okay, so this is step one. Your position on what feels like a flat surface, but is actually a sphere.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
But this sphere is always moving, never staying in one position.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Earth is orbiting a star, the Sun at the center of the solar system.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
While we usually imagine this is pretty orderly, someone looking at us from the outside would see something pretty messy.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
To see this more clearly, we'll exaggerate all these movements. This is not to scale.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse, so we spend half the year sinking a little bit closer to the Sun,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
speeding up, and half the year rising up a bit and slowing down.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
And the ellipse itself changes its shape every 100,000 years too.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the ellipse itself is drifting, which at least creates a beautiful shape.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
In the end, we get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly circle with wavy edges.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
It gets worse as the Moon now starts to mess things up too.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
As the Moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on Earth.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
Both objects orbit their common center of gravity that lies around 4,700 kilometers off to the side of Earth's core.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
In practice, this means that as the Moon orbits Earth, it's jerking Earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
Okay, so you're standing on the surface of a rotating planet that is jiggling around the Sun in an elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
But who's to say the Earth is right?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
From the perspective of the Sun, the plane of the solar system is arbitrary.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
It's defined as the plane the Earth orbits in because that is convenient for us.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
In reality, the other planets are just a little bit inclined with respect to our plane.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
From their point of view, we're the ones with a slightly bent orbit.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But this isn't it. Far from it.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
The solar system as a whole is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
If we look at the Milky Way, we can clearly make out a galactic plane in which the solar system orbits the center every 230 million years.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
But of course, it's not that simple.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
First of all, the plane of the solar system is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Nothing really is.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
Just like the planets in the solar system orbit the Sun on their own planes, so do all the stars orbiting the galactic center.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
The solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees towards the galactic plane,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
speeding through space at almost a million kilometers per hour.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Someone in the center of the galaxy would see the orbits of the planets moving through space in a helix shape,

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
which you can imagine as a corkscrew motion on the tilted plane of the solar system relative to the plane of the galaxy.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
This orientation in space means that sometimes the planets are sort of in front of the Sun as it orbits around the galactic core.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Let's just look at this for a moment.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
There is a strange and eerie beauty about how our planets and the Sun move through space.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
This is still not the whole story because the mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on the solar system too.

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
Like a drunk dolphin, we're diving down and shooting up hundreds of light years through the galactic plane ten times every orbit,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
along arcs thousands of light years long.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
We haven't mapped this motion out completely, as it takes the solar system tens of millions of years to go up and back once,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
and well, humanity is not that old.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Let's look at your relative position again.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
On a planet tilted towards the Sun, jiggled around by the Moon,

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
the solar system tilted towards the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical shape, diving up and down through the plane.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Hmm, but where is up in a galaxy?

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
At this point, the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary and pointless because of the nature of the universe at this scale.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
The Milky Way is part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of greater structures like the Laniakea supercluster,

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces-Cetus supercluster complex,

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
and finally a galactic filament that spans hundreds of millions of light years in all directions and orientations.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Someone looking right at us from that far away will only see the end of greatness.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
All stuff appears homogeneous, the same everywhere.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
Just like with empty space, when everything looks the same, who's to say anyone's view is better than anyone else's?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
We've reached the end of our little exercise in cosmic humidity.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
Let's make the journey backwards again, from the indescribably large, to the really large, to our galactic home, to our galaxy,

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
to the solar system diving up and down through the Milky Way, to the jiggle of existence.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
And finally, back to you right now, watching this video.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
If this is all a bit much, don't feel bad.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
The scale of the universe is brain-crushing,

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
and trying to keep track of how everything is oriented or decide where the best up and down is, is hard.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
But it doesn't really matter, because it doesn't change where you are.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
You're already in the best spot you possibly could be.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Right here, right now.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
For all you care, nothing can stop you from being right at the center of your own little universe.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Perspective really is everything.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
That's true for the universe we all inhabit, but even more so within your personal universe.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
The way your life will unfold also depends on what you consider possible.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Take us at Kurzgesagt.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Our passion is to spark curiosity for science and make videos for free.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
But this is not a great business model, so we began to create our own lines of science posters, calendars and fun Kurzgesagt merch,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
pieces of Kurzgesagt that you can take home and touch.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
And we're doing this with Shopify, who were also so kind as to sponsor this video,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
which delighted us because we've been using their platform for years now.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Shopify is an e-commerce platform that allows you to start and grow your business.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
And by starting a business, we really do mean from scratch.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
If you want to sell your handmade ceramic mugs out of your bedroom today, you can.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
But not just that, if you want to scale your one-man show to a sizable team,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
then Shopify has the tools to support you on your journey.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Now you just have to get started.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
Go to Shopify.com slash Kurzgesagt to get a free 14-day trial.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
If you think that this idea doesn't apply to you and your ideas are too small,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
we want to encourage you to think again.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
The first video on this channel was a university project and Kurzgesagt itself was a creative outlet.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Eventually, we grew into a business and the team that is making videos for you today.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And all of that just because we wanted to try out something new.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
This is exactly the sort of thing that Shopify is determined to support and you can build your own thing with it.

09:21.000 --> 09:29.000
After all, whether your idea is still just a dream or might turn into a plan today is also just a matter of perspective.

09:29.000 --> 09:37.000
Millions of businesses in over 175 countries are currently using Shopify to sell their products and we are one of them.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Thanks to them for helping us get here and thanks to all of you for making our channel possible.
