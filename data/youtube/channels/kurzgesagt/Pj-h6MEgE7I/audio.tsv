0	6000	Look around you. Where are you? Where is this place you're occupying?
6000	13000	Somewhere in a room, maybe in a city, on a continent, on a planet, orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.
13000	16000	But where is all of that?
16000	24000	While this may feel like a daft question, it turns out that the concept of an absolute position is something humans made up.
24000	28000	In a nutshell, the universe is a big bag of space that has things in it.
28000	35000	If someone removed all these things, the stars and planets and black holes and dust, there would just be empty space left.
35000	39000	In empty space, the concept of having a position loses all meaning.
39000	43000	Empty space is uniform, the same everywhere.
43000	47000	The space we occupy is not like a stage under our feet.
47000	52000	We can't mark specific points or staple something to space-time as an anchor.
52000	55000	Without things, there is no position.
55000	60000	We are really ever only at a position in relation to something else.
60000	66000	Which also means that things we take for granted, like up and down, are actually relative, too.
66000	73000	Okay, let's fill the universe up with things again and try to find out where you are right now, relative to everything else.
73000	88000	Let's start this video at a familiar place and then get increasingly weird.
88000	93000	From your perspective, the world is seemingly flat, and you can move in three dimensions.
93000	102000	It's what physicists call a frame of reference, the perspective you have of the universe and how you see things moving around you, where your up and down is.
102000	108000	Your frame of reference is correct for you, but not for the rest of the universe.
108000	114000	Around five kilometers from you, where the horizon begins, the ground noticeably curves away from you.
114000	119000	If you could see through the ground, you'd see people from below or sideways.
119000	124000	But they don't fall down off the planet because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.
124000	127000	Down is an illusion of your reference frame.
127000	131000	To Earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in.
131000	137000	But for humans, there is an up and down, because within our frame of reference, that just makes sense.
137000	144000	Which is also why we think that the planet itself has an up and down, north and south, and we made our maps accordingly.
144000	149000	But an observer looking at the solar system might disagree.
149000	154000	Our maps make sense to us because we're used to them, not because they are correct.
154000	161000	Okay, so this is step one. Your position on what feels like a flat surface, but is actually a sphere.
161000	165000	But this sphere is always moving, never staying in one position.
165000	169000	Earth is orbiting a star, the Sun at the center of the solar system.
169000	176000	While we usually imagine this is pretty orderly, someone looking at us from the outside would see something pretty messy.
176000	181000	To see this more clearly, we'll exaggerate all these movements. This is not to scale.
181000	187000	First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse, so we spend half the year sinking a little bit closer to the Sun,
187000	191000	speeding up, and half the year rising up a bit and slowing down.
191000	196000	And the ellipse itself changes its shape every 100,000 years too.
196000	204000	And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the ellipse itself is drifting, which at least creates a beautiful shape.
204000	209000	In the end, we get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly circle with wavy edges.
209000	213000	It gets worse as the Moon now starts to mess things up too.
213000	217000	As the Moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on Earth.
217000	224000	Both objects orbit their common center of gravity that lies around 4,700 kilometers off to the side of Earth's core.
224000	231000	In practice, this means that as the Moon orbits Earth, it's jerking Earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle.
231000	239000	Okay, so you're standing on the surface of a rotating planet that is jiggling around the Sun in an elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year.
239000	242000	But who's to say the Earth is right?
242000	246000	From the perspective of the Sun, the plane of the solar system is arbitrary.
246000	251000	It's defined as the plane the Earth orbits in because that is convenient for us.
251000	256000	In reality, the other planets are just a little bit inclined with respect to our plane.
256000	260000	From their point of view, we're the ones with a slightly bent orbit.
260000	262000	But this isn't it. Far from it.
262000	267000	The solar system as a whole is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
267000	275000	If we look at the Milky Way, we can clearly make out a galactic plane in which the solar system orbits the center every 230 million years.
275000	278000	But of course, it's not that simple.
278000	283000	First of all, the plane of the solar system is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.
283000	284000	Nothing really is.
284000	291000	Just like the planets in the solar system orbit the Sun on their own planes, so do all the stars orbiting the galactic center.
291000	296000	The solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees towards the galactic plane,
296000	300000	speeding through space at almost a million kilometers per hour.
300000	305000	Someone in the center of the galaxy would see the orbits of the planets moving through space in a helix shape,
305000	312000	which you can imagine as a corkscrew motion on the tilted plane of the solar system relative to the plane of the galaxy.
312000	319000	This orientation in space means that sometimes the planets are sort of in front of the Sun as it orbits around the galactic core.
319000	321000	Let's just look at this for a moment.
321000	326000	There is a strange and eerie beauty about how our planets and the Sun move through space.
326000	330000	Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse.
330000	337000	This is still not the whole story because the mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on the solar system too.
337000	344000	Like a drunk dolphin, we're diving down and shooting up hundreds of light years through the galactic plane ten times every orbit,
344000	347000	along arcs thousands of light years long.
347000	354000	We haven't mapped this motion out completely, as it takes the solar system tens of millions of years to go up and back once,
354000	357000	and well, humanity is not that old.
357000	360000	Let's look at your relative position again.
360000	364000	On a planet tilted towards the Sun, jiggled around by the Moon,
364000	371000	the solar system tilted towards the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical shape, diving up and down through the plane.
371000	374000	Hmm, but where is up in a galaxy?
374000	381000	At this point, the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary and pointless because of the nature of the universe at this scale.
381000	387000	The Milky Way is part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of greater structures like the Laniakea supercluster,
387000	391000	which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces-Cetus supercluster complex,
391000	398000	and finally a galactic filament that spans hundreds of millions of light years in all directions and orientations.
398000	404000	Someone looking right at us from that far away will only see the end of greatness.
404000	408000	All stuff appears homogeneous, the same everywhere.
408000	414000	Just like with empty space, when everything looks the same, who's to say anyone's view is better than anyone else's?
415000	419000	We've reached the end of our little exercise in cosmic humidity.
419000	427000	Let's make the journey backwards again, from the indescribably large, to the really large, to our galactic home, to our galaxy,
427000	432000	to the solar system diving up and down through the Milky Way, to the jiggle of existence.
432000	436000	And finally, back to you right now, watching this video.
437000	440000	If this is all a bit much, don't feel bad.
441000	443000	The scale of the universe is brain-crushing,
443000	448000	and trying to keep track of how everything is oriented or decide where the best up and down is, is hard.
448000	452000	But it doesn't really matter, because it doesn't change where you are.
452000	455000	You're already in the best spot you possibly could be.
455000	457000	Right here, right now.
457000	464000	For all you care, nothing can stop you from being right at the center of your own little universe.
466000	468000	Perspective really is everything.
468000	474000	That's true for the universe we all inhabit, but even more so within your personal universe.
474000	478000	The way your life will unfold also depends on what you consider possible.
478000	480000	Take us at Kurzgesagt.
480000	485000	Our passion is to spark curiosity for science and make videos for free.
485000	493000	But this is not a great business model, so we began to create our own lines of science posters, calendars and fun Kurzgesagt merch,
493000	497000	pieces of Kurzgesagt that you can take home and touch.
497000	502000	And we're doing this with Shopify, who were also so kind as to sponsor this video,
502000	506000	which delighted us because we've been using their platform for years now.
506000	510000	Shopify is an e-commerce platform that allows you to start and grow your business.
510000	514000	And by starting a business, we really do mean from scratch.
514000	519000	If you want to sell your handmade ceramic mugs out of your bedroom today, you can.
519000	523000	But not just that, if you want to scale your one-man show to a sizable team,
523000	526000	then Shopify has the tools to support you on your journey.
526000	528000	Now you just have to get started.
528000	534000	Go to Shopify.com slash Kurzgesagt to get a free 14-day trial.
534000	538000	If you think that this idea doesn't apply to you and your ideas are too small,
538000	541000	we want to encourage you to think again.
541000	547000	The first video on this channel was a university project and Kurzgesagt itself was a creative outlet.
547000	551000	Eventually, we grew into a business and the team that is making videos for you today.
551000	555000	And all of that just because we wanted to try out something new.
555000	561000	This is exactly the sort of thing that Shopify is determined to support and you can build your own thing with it.
561000	569000	After all, whether your idea is still just a dream or might turn into a plan today is also just a matter of perspective.
569000	577000	Millions of businesses in over 175 countries are currently using Shopify to sell their products and we are one of them.
577000	583000	Thanks to them for helping us get here and thanks to all of you for making our channel possible.
