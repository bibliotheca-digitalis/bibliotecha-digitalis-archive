00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Recently, there's been a lot of talk about measles.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,040
What does measles actually do, and should you vaccinate against it, or is this just hysteria?

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,600
Measles is a virus.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
A hull of proteins, RNA, plus some more proteins for reproduction.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It cannot reproduce by itself, it needs a host cell to do so.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
To understand measles, we have to understand the immune system.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,360
You might already have seen the visual system we developed to help here.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
Now, let's focus on the parts of the immune system relevant to measles.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,080
The measles virus enters humans through the nose, mouth, or eyes.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
The measles infection starts in the lungs.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Measles is especially good at infecting the body's first line of defense, macrophages.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,040
Powerful guard cells that protect the lungs from intruders.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,280
They enter a cell and take it over.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,040
The virus reprograms the cell and transforms it into a dangerous virus production center.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,200
Once a cell is filled with viruses, they leave the crippled cell and begin the cycle over again.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,120
But the immune system has powerful weapons against virus infections.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
Natural killer cells.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
These cells basically patrol the body and check other cells for infections.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
If they find an infected cell, they order it to commit suicide.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
This is so effective that for the first 10 days or so,

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
you will not even notice that you're infected with measles.

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
And now, the reason why measles is so powerful.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
After a period of fighting and dying,

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
macrophages alert the brain of the immune system, the dendritic cells.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,760
The job of the dendritic cells is to collect samples of intruders,

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,800
travel to the lymph nodes, and then activate the heavy weapons

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,920
that eradicate the infection very fast in a team effort.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,400
But the measles virus uses a dreadful tactic.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,160
It infects the dendritic cells and uses them as a trojan horse to enter deeper into the body.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,720
The infected cells travel to the next lymph node to alert other immune cells.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,040
Once it arrives, the measles virus spreads around the virgin T and B cells and infects them.

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,480
It attacks the very system that evolved to fight it.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
Now, things happen very fast.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
The lymph system spreads the virus everywhere,

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
and it enters the bloodstream, infecting cells while traveling.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
Measles infects organs like the spleen, the liver, the intestines, and most importantly, the lungs.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,560
The symptoms range from a very high fever, headache, sickness, bronchitis, and of course, a rash.

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
In the lungs, the immune system was doing pretty okay,

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
but now millions of viruses attack a second time and kill countless cells,

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
wiping out the defense systems.

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
In this phase, you start coughing out millions of measles viruses.

42
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,320
Measles is so contagious at this stage that if you meet someone who isn't vaccinated,

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,600
there's about a 90% chance you'll infect them.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,520
Without the protective army in the lungs,

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,240
other bacteria or viruses that would usually not stand a chance can now enter the lungs

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,240
and develop into harmful parallel infections that can cause pneumonia,

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,720
the most common way to die from measles.

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
Your body's immune system is now seriously wounded.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
Various protective systems are hurt and disrupted.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
The virus spreads everywhere, infecting the skin all over the body.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
The typical measles rash now becomes visible.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,000
And in some cases, the measles virus reaches the brain and causes a brain infection.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,400
If it does so, the chances of dying are between 20 to 40%, and there may be long-term damage.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,440
But your body is far from giving up at this stage, and it fights back aggressively.

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,960
Some dendritic cells survive long enough to activate the antivirus forces of the body.

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,440
Plasma cells in the lymph nodes start producing billions of antibodies,

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,640
tiny proteins that mark infected cells for destruction or clump the virus together.

58
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Killer T cells flood the body and kill infected cells left and right.

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,760
After two to three weeks, the body usually gets the upper hand and overwhelms the infection.

60
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,720
But the immune system is now seriously weakened and may take weeks or months to recover,

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,520
leaving the body vulnerable to other diseases.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,720
But if you make it, you are now immune.

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
The immune system remembers the virus forever.

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Measles is no joke.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Although 84% of all humans are vaccinated against measles,

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,240
122,000 people died because of the infection in 2014.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,840
Some people cannot get vaccinations, either because they're too young,

68
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,600
because of chemotherapy or HIV, or because they're allergic to the vaccine.

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
They need the rest of us to stop the disease for them.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
The measles vaccination is safe, cheap, and available.

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
There are no benefits from having measles at all.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
You don't strengthen your immune system, and it's not more natural.

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Most people who don't vaccinate only want the best for their children, which is honorable.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
But if you ask yourself,

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,320
am I putting the life of my child and other children at risk by not vaccinating against measles?

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
The sad answer is yes.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,440
Yes, you are.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Let's not play the blame game, though.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,480
Let's work together and eradicate this virus.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,960
Together, we can get rid of these dreadful monsters

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:20,800
and consign them to their rightful place, the history books.
