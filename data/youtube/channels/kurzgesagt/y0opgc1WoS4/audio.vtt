00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Recently, there's been a lot of talk about measles.

00:02.880 --> 00:09.040
What does measles actually do, and should you vaccinate against it, or is this just hysteria?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.600
Measles is a virus.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.000
A hull of proteins, RNA, plus some more proteins for reproduction.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
It cannot reproduce by itself, it needs a host cell to do so.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.080
To understand measles, we have to understand the immune system.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.360
You might already have seen the visual system we developed to help here.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.160
Now, let's focus on the parts of the immune system relevant to measles.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.080
The measles virus enters humans through the nose, mouth, or eyes.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.240
The measles infection starts in the lungs.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.680
Measles is especially good at infecting the body's first line of defense, macrophages.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.040
Powerful guard cells that protect the lungs from intruders.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.280
They enter a cell and take it over.

00:55.360 --> 01:01.040
The virus reprograms the cell and transforms it into a dangerous virus production center.

01:01.040 --> 01:07.200
Once a cell is filled with viruses, they leave the crippled cell and begin the cycle over again.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.120
But the immune system has powerful weapons against virus infections.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.720
Natural killer cells.

01:12.720 --> 01:17.360
These cells basically patrol the body and check other cells for infections.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
If they find an infected cell, they order it to commit suicide.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.720
This is so effective that for the first 10 days or so,

01:24.720 --> 01:28.080
you will not even notice that you're infected with measles.

01:28.080 --> 01:31.920
And now, the reason why measles is so powerful.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.840
After a period of fighting and dying,

01:33.840 --> 01:38.080
macrophages alert the brain of the immune system, the dendritic cells.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.760
The job of the dendritic cells is to collect samples of intruders,

01:41.760 --> 01:44.800
travel to the lymph nodes, and then activate the heavy weapons

01:44.800 --> 01:47.920
that eradicate the infection very fast in a team effort.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.400
But the measles virus uses a dreadful tactic.

01:52.400 --> 01:58.160
It infects the dendritic cells and uses them as a trojan horse to enter deeper into the body.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.720
The infected cells travel to the next lymph node to alert other immune cells.

02:02.720 --> 02:09.040
Once it arrives, the measles virus spreads around the virgin T and B cells and infects them.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.480
It attacks the very system that evolved to fight it.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.400
Now, things happen very fast.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.800
The lymph system spreads the virus everywhere,

02:16.800 --> 02:20.080
and it enters the bloodstream, infecting cells while traveling.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.200
Measles infects organs like the spleen, the liver, the intestines, and most importantly, the lungs.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.560
The symptoms range from a very high fever, headache, sickness, bronchitis, and of course, a rash.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.280
In the lungs, the immune system was doing pretty okay,

02:33.280 --> 02:37.680
but now millions of viruses attack a second time and kill countless cells,

02:37.680 --> 02:39.440
wiping out the defense systems.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.040
In this phase, you start coughing out millions of measles viruses.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.320
Measles is so contagious at this stage that if you meet someone who isn't vaccinated,

02:48.320 --> 02:51.600
there's about a 90% chance you'll infect them.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.520
Without the protective army in the lungs,

02:53.520 --> 02:58.240
other bacteria or viruses that would usually not stand a chance can now enter the lungs

02:58.240 --> 03:02.240
and develop into harmful parallel infections that can cause pneumonia,

03:02.240 --> 03:04.720
the most common way to die from measles.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.920
Your body's immune system is now seriously wounded.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.040
Various protective systems are hurt and disrupted.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.360
The virus spreads everywhere, infecting the skin all over the body.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.400
The typical measles rash now becomes visible.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.000
And in some cases, the measles virus reaches the brain and causes a brain infection.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.400
If it does so, the chances of dying are between 20 to 40%, and there may be long-term damage.

03:30.400 --> 03:35.440
But your body is far from giving up at this stage, and it fights back aggressively.

03:35.440 --> 03:40.960
Some dendritic cells survive long enough to activate the antivirus forces of the body.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.440
Plasma cells in the lymph nodes start producing billions of antibodies,

03:45.440 --> 03:50.640
tiny proteins that mark infected cells for destruction or clump the virus together.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.720
Killer T cells flood the body and kill infected cells left and right.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.760
After two to three weeks, the body usually gets the upper hand and overwhelms the infection.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.720
But the immune system is now seriously weakened and may take weeks or months to recover,

04:04.720 --> 04:07.520
leaving the body vulnerable to other diseases.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.720
But if you make it, you are now immune.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.200
The immune system remembers the virus forever.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.600
Measles is no joke.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.600
Although 84% of all humans are vaccinated against measles,

04:19.600 --> 04:24.240
122,000 people died because of the infection in 2014.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.840
Some people cannot get vaccinations, either because they're too young,

04:27.840 --> 04:31.600
because of chemotherapy or HIV, or because they're allergic to the vaccine.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.360
They need the rest of us to stop the disease for them.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.120
The measles vaccination is safe, cheap, and available.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.600
There are no benefits from having measles at all.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.680
You don't strengthen your immune system, and it's not more natural.

04:45.680 --> 04:50.000
Most people who don't vaccinate only want the best for their children, which is honorable.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.280
But if you ask yourself,

04:51.280 --> 04:56.320
am I putting the life of my child and other children at risk by not vaccinating against measles?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.160
The sad answer is yes.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.440
Yes, you are.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.840
Let's not play the blame game, though.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.480
Let's work together and eradicate this virus.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
Together, we can get rid of these dreadful monsters

05:06.960 --> 05:20.800
and consign them to their rightful place, the history books.
