0	2880	Recently, there's been a lot of talk about measles.
2880	9040	What does measles actually do, and should you vaccinate against it, or is this just hysteria?
15840	17600	Measles is a virus.
17600	22000	A hull of proteins, RNA, plus some more proteins for reproduction.
22000	26000	It cannot reproduce by itself, it needs a host cell to do so.
26080	30080	To understand measles, we have to understand the immune system.
30080	33360	You might already have seen the visual system we developed to help here.
33920	38160	Now, let's focus on the parts of the immune system relevant to measles.
38160	42080	The measles virus enters humans through the nose, mouth, or eyes.
42080	44240	The measles infection starts in the lungs.
44880	49680	Measles is especially good at infecting the body's first line of defense, macrophages.
49680	53040	Powerful guard cells that protect the lungs from intruders.
53040	55280	They enter a cell and take it over.
55360	61040	The virus reprograms the cell and transforms it into a dangerous virus production center.
61040	67200	Once a cell is filled with viruses, they leave the crippled cell and begin the cycle over again.
67200	71120	But the immune system has powerful weapons against virus infections.
71120	72720	Natural killer cells.
72720	77360	These cells basically patrol the body and check other cells for infections.
77360	81680	If they find an infected cell, they order it to commit suicide.
81680	84720	This is so effective that for the first 10 days or so,
84720	88080	you will not even notice that you're infected with measles.
88080	91920	And now, the reason why measles is so powerful.
91920	93840	After a period of fighting and dying,
93840	98080	macrophages alert the brain of the immune system, the dendritic cells.
98080	101760	The job of the dendritic cells is to collect samples of intruders,
101760	104800	travel to the lymph nodes, and then activate the heavy weapons
104800	107920	that eradicate the infection very fast in a team effort.
108720	112400	But the measles virus uses a dreadful tactic.
112400	118160	It infects the dendritic cells and uses them as a trojan horse to enter deeper into the body.
118160	122720	The infected cells travel to the next lymph node to alert other immune cells.
122720	129040	Once it arrives, the measles virus spreads around the virgin T and B cells and infects them.
129040	132480	It attacks the very system that evolved to fight it.
132480	134400	Now, things happen very fast.
134400	136800	The lymph system spreads the virus everywhere,
136800	140080	and it enters the bloodstream, infecting cells while traveling.
140080	145200	Measles infects organs like the spleen, the liver, the intestines, and most importantly, the lungs.
145200	150560	The symptoms range from a very high fever, headache, sickness, bronchitis, and of course, a rash.
150560	153280	In the lungs, the immune system was doing pretty okay,
153280	157680	but now millions of viruses attack a second time and kill countless cells,
157680	159440	wiping out the defense systems.
159440	163040	In this phase, you start coughing out millions of measles viruses.
163680	168320	Measles is so contagious at this stage that if you meet someone who isn't vaccinated,
168320	171600	there's about a 90% chance you'll infect them.
171600	173520	Without the protective army in the lungs,
173520	178240	other bacteria or viruses that would usually not stand a chance can now enter the lungs
178240	182240	and develop into harmful parallel infections that can cause pneumonia,
182240	184720	the most common way to die from measles.
184720	187920	Your body's immune system is now seriously wounded.
187920	191040	Various protective systems are hurt and disrupted.
191040	195360	The virus spreads everywhere, infecting the skin all over the body.
195360	198400	The typical measles rash now becomes visible.
198400	204000	And in some cases, the measles virus reaches the brain and causes a brain infection.
204000	210400	If it does so, the chances of dying are between 20 to 40%, and there may be long-term damage.
210400	215440	But your body is far from giving up at this stage, and it fights back aggressively.
215440	220960	Some dendritic cells survive long enough to activate the antivirus forces of the body.
220960	225440	Plasma cells in the lymph nodes start producing billions of antibodies,
225440	230640	tiny proteins that mark infected cells for destruction or clump the virus together.
230640	234720	Killer T cells flood the body and kill infected cells left and right.
234720	239760	After two to three weeks, the body usually gets the upper hand and overwhelms the infection.
239760	244720	But the immune system is now seriously weakened and may take weeks or months to recover,
244720	247520	leaving the body vulnerable to other diseases.
247520	250720	But if you make it, you are now immune.
250720	253200	The immune system remembers the virus forever.
253920	255600	Measles is no joke.
255600	259600	Although 84% of all humans are vaccinated against measles,
259600	264240	122,000 people died because of the infection in 2014.
264240	267840	Some people cannot get vaccinations, either because they're too young,
267840	271600	because of chemotherapy or HIV, or because they're allergic to the vaccine.
272240	275360	They need the rest of us to stop the disease for them.
275360	279120	The measles vaccination is safe, cheap, and available.
279120	281600	There are no benefits from having measles at all.
281600	285680	You don't strengthen your immune system, and it's not more natural.
285680	290000	Most people who don't vaccinate only want the best for their children, which is honorable.
290000	291280	But if you ask yourself,
291280	296320	am I putting the life of my child and other children at risk by not vaccinating against measles?
296320	298160	The sad answer is yes.
298720	299440	Yes, you are.
300000	301840	Let's not play the blame game, though.
301840	304480	Let's work together and eradicate this virus.
304480	306960	Together, we can get rid of these dreadful monsters
306960	320800	and consign them to their rightful place, the history books.
