0	10160	The Solar System, our home in space.
10160	13900	We live in a peaceful part of the Milky Way.
13900	18860	Our home is the Solar System, a four and a half billion year old formation that races
18860	27180	around the galactic center at 200,000 kilometers per hour and circles it once every 250 million
27180	29840	years.
29840	34220	Our star, the Sun, is at the center of the Solar System.
34220	41260	It's orbited by eight planets, trillions of asteroids and comets, and a few dwarf planets.
41260	47800	The eight planets are divided into four planets like ours, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
47800	54240	and four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
54240	57320	Mercury is the smallest and lightest of all the planets.
57320	64360	A mercury year is shorter than a mercury day, which leads to enormous fluctuations in temperature.
64360	68960	Mercury does not have an atmosphere or a moon.
68960	74120	Venus is one of the brightest objects in the Solar System and by far the hottest planet
74120	80760	with atmospheric pressure that is 92 times higher than on Earth.
80760	89320	An out of control greenhouse effect means that Venus never cools below 437 degrees Celsius.
89320	93440	Venus also doesn't have a moon.
93440	97560	Earth is our home and the only planet with temperatures that are moderate enough to allow
97560	100320	for a surplus of liquid water.
100320	106500	Furthermore, it's so far the only place where life is known to exist.
106500	110560	The Earth has one moon.
110560	114520	Venus is the second smallest planet in the Solar System and hardly massive enough to
114520	116880	keep a very thin atmosphere.
116880	121400	Its Olympus Mons is the largest mountain in the Solar System, more than three times as
121400	124440	high as Mount Everest.
124440	129440	Mars has two small moons.
129440	133280	Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System.
133280	137760	It consists largely of hydrogen and helium and is the theatre for the largest and most
137760	141260	powerful storms we know.
141260	146160	Its largest storm, the Great Red Spot, is three times as large as Earth.
146160	149880	Jupiter has 67 moons.
149880	155720	Saturn is the second largest planet and possesses the smallest density of all the planets.
155720	160440	If you had a sufficiently large bathtub, Saturn would swim in it.
160440	165580	Saturn is also known for its extended, very visible ring system.
165580	168140	It has 62 moons.
168140	172660	Uranus is the third largest planet and one of the coldest.
172660	175980	Of all the gas giants, it's also the smallest.
175980	181260	The special thing about Uranus is that its axis of rotation is tilted sideways in contrast
181260	183200	to the seven other planets.
183200	186660	It has 27 moons.
186660	191420	Neptune is the last planet in the Solar System and is similar to Uranus.
191540	198540	It's so far removed from the Sun that a Neptune year is 164 Earth years long.
198540	204680	The highest wind speed ever measured was in a storm on Neptune at just under 2,100 kilometers
204680	207820	per hour.
207820	212380	Neptune has 14 moons.
212380	218380	If we compare the sizes of the planets, the differences between them become even clearer.
218740	223220	Jupiter is the leader in terms of size and weight.
223220	229020	Small Mercury, on the other hand, is even smaller than one of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede.
229020	234820	Jupiter is so massive that alone it contains roughly 70% of the mass of all the other planets
234820	238460	and has a massive impact on its surroundings.
238460	243300	That's a blessing for Earth, since Jupiter draws most of the dangerously large asteroids
243300	247520	that could wipe out life on Earth.
247560	252360	But even Jupiter is a dwarf in comparison to our star, the Sun.
252360	255880	Calling it massive does not do justice to the Sun.
255880	261020	It makes up 99.86% of the mass in our Solar System.
261020	264440	For the most part, it consists of hydrogen and helium.
264440	269760	Only less than 2% is made up of heavy elements like oxygen or iron.
269760	276040	At its core, the Sun fuses 620 million tons of hydrogen each second and generates enough
276080	281800	energy to satisfy mankind's needs for years.
281800	284880	But not only the eight planets orbit our Sun.
284880	289220	Trillions of asteroids and comets also circle it.
289220	295280	Most of them are concentrated into two belts, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
295280	299060	and the Kuiper belt at the edge of the Solar System.
299060	303320	These belts are home to countless objects, some as large as a dust particle, others the
303320	306480	size of dwarf planets.
306480	310000	The most well-known object in the asteroid belt is Ceres.
310000	315920	The most well-known objects in the Kuiper belt are Pluto, Makemake and Haumea.
315920	321120	Usually, we describe the asteroid belt as a dense collection of bodies that constantly
321120	323120	collide.
323120	328400	But in fact, the asteroids are distributed across an area that is so indescribably large
328400	332960	that it's even difficult to see two asteroids at once.
332960	338160	Despite the billions of objects in them, the asteroid belts are fairly empty places.
338160	342060	And nonetheless, there are collisions over and over again.
342060	345240	The mass of both belts is also unimpressive.
345240	349900	The asteroid belt has a little less than 4% of our Moon's mass.
349900	357440	And the Kuiper belt is only between 1.25th and 1.10th of Earth's mass.
357440	360660	One day the Solar System will cease to exist.
360660	366800	The Sun will die and Mercury, Venus and maybe Earth too will be destroyed.
366800	372260	In 500 million years, it will become hotter and hotter until at some point it will melt
372260	375600	Earth's crust.
375600	380540	Then the Sun will grow and grow and either swallow Earth or at least turn it into a sea
380540	384700	of lava.
384700	389040	When it has burnt up all its fuel and lost most of its mass, it will shrink to a white
389040	396960	dwarf and burn gently for a few billion more years before it goes out entirely.
396960	401700	Then at the latest, life in the Solar System will no longer be possible.
401700	404280	The Milky Way will not even notice it.
404280	409200	A small part of it in one of its arms will become just a tiny bit darker.
409200	412520	And mankind will cease to exist.
412520	416720	Or leave the Solar System in search of a new home.
