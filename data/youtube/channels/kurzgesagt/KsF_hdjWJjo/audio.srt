1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
The Solar System, our home in space.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,900
We live in a peaceful part of the Milky Way.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,860
Our home is the Solar System, a four and a half billion year old formation that races

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:27,180
around the galactic center at 200,000 kilometers per hour and circles it once every 250 million

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,840
years.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,220
Our star, the Sun, is at the center of the Solar System.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:41,260
It's orbited by eight planets, trillions of asteroids and comets, and a few dwarf planets.

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,800
The eight planets are divided into four planets like ours, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,240
and four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,320
Mercury is the smallest and lightest of all the planets.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,360
A mercury year is shorter than a mercury day, which leads to enormous fluctuations in temperature.

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,960
Mercury does not have an atmosphere or a moon.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,120
Venus is one of the brightest objects in the Solar System and by far the hottest planet

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,760
with atmospheric pressure that is 92 times higher than on Earth.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:29,320
An out of control greenhouse effect means that Venus never cools below 437 degrees Celsius.

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,440
Venus also doesn't have a moon.

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,560
Earth is our home and the only planet with temperatures that are moderate enough to allow

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,320
for a surplus of liquid water.

19
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,500
Furthermore, it's so far the only place where life is known to exist.

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,560
The Earth has one moon.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,520
Venus is the second smallest planet in the Solar System and hardly massive enough to

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,880
keep a very thin atmosphere.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,400
Its Olympus Mons is the largest mountain in the Solar System, more than three times as

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,440
high as Mount Everest.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Mars has two small moons.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
It consists largely of hydrogen and helium and is the theatre for the largest and most

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,260
powerful storms we know.

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,160
Its largest storm, the Great Red Spot, is three times as large as Earth.

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Jupiter has 67 moons.

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Saturn is the second largest planet and possesses the smallest density of all the planets.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,440
If you had a sufficiently large bathtub, Saturn would swim in it.

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,580
Saturn is also known for its extended, very visible ring system.

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,140
It has 62 moons.

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,660
Uranus is the third largest planet and one of the coldest.

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,980
Of all the gas giants, it's also the smallest.

37
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,260
The special thing about Uranus is that its axis of rotation is tilted sideways in contrast

38
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,200
to the seven other planets.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,660
It has 27 moons.

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,420
Neptune is the last planet in the Solar System and is similar to Uranus.

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,540
It's so far removed from the Sun that a Neptune year is 164 Earth years long.

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,680
The highest wind speed ever measured was in a storm on Neptune at just under 2,100 kilometers

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,820
per hour.

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,380
Neptune has 14 moons.

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,380
If we compare the sizes of the planets, the differences between them become even clearer.

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,220
Jupiter is the leader in terms of size and weight.

47
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,020
Small Mercury, on the other hand, is even smaller than one of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede.

48
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,820
Jupiter is so massive that alone it contains roughly 70% of the mass of all the other planets

49
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,460
and has a massive impact on its surroundings.

50
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,300
That's a blessing for Earth, since Jupiter draws most of the dangerously large asteroids

51
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,520
that could wipe out life on Earth.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,360
But even Jupiter is a dwarf in comparison to our star, the Sun.

53
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Calling it massive does not do justice to the Sun.

54
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,020
It makes up 99.86% of the mass in our Solar System.

55
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,440
For the most part, it consists of hydrogen and helium.

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,760
Only less than 2% is made up of heavy elements like oxygen or iron.

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,040
At its core, the Sun fuses 620 million tons of hydrogen each second and generates enough

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,800
energy to satisfy mankind's needs for years.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,880
But not only the eight planets orbit our Sun.

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,220
Trillions of asteroids and comets also circle it.

61
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,280
Most of them are concentrated into two belts, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,060
and the Kuiper belt at the edge of the Solar System.

63
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,320
These belts are home to countless objects, some as large as a dust particle, others the

64
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,480
size of dwarf planets.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,000
The most well-known object in the asteroid belt is Ceres.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,920
The most well-known objects in the Kuiper belt are Pluto, Makemake and Haumea.

67
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,120
Usually, we describe the asteroid belt as a dense collection of bodies that constantly

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
collide.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,400
But in fact, the asteroids are distributed across an area that is so indescribably large

70
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,960
that it's even difficult to see two asteroids at once.

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
Despite the billions of objects in them, the asteroid belts are fairly empty places.

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,060
And nonetheless, there are collisions over and over again.

73
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,240
The mass of both belts is also unimpressive.

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,900
The asteroid belt has a little less than 4% of our Moon's mass.

75
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:57,440
And the Kuiper belt is only between 1.25th and 1.10th of Earth's mass.

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,660
One day the Solar System will cease to exist.

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,800
The Sun will die and Mercury, Venus and maybe Earth too will be destroyed.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,260
In 500 million years, it will become hotter and hotter until at some point it will melt

79
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,600
Earth's crust.

80
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,540
Then the Sun will grow and grow and either swallow Earth or at least turn it into a sea

81
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,700
of lava.

82
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,040
When it has burnt up all its fuel and lost most of its mass, it will shrink to a white

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,960
dwarf and burn gently for a few billion more years before it goes out entirely.

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,700
Then at the latest, life in the Solar System will no longer be possible.

85
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,280
The Milky Way will not even notice it.

86
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,200
A small part of it in one of its arms will become just a tiny bit darker.

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,520
And mankind will cease to exist.

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,720
Or leave the Solar System in search of a new home.
