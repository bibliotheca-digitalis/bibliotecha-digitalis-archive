00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
The Solar System, our home in space.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.900
We live in a peaceful part of the Milky Way.

00:13.900 --> 00:18.860
Our home is the Solar System, a four and a half billion year old formation that races

00:18.860 --> 00:27.180
around the galactic center at 200,000 kilometers per hour and circles it once every 250 million

00:27.180 --> 00:29.840
years.

00:29.840 --> 00:34.220
Our star, the Sun, is at the center of the Solar System.

00:34.220 --> 00:41.260
It's orbited by eight planets, trillions of asteroids and comets, and a few dwarf planets.

00:41.260 --> 00:47.800
The eight planets are divided into four planets like ours, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:47.800 --> 00:54.240
and four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.320
Mercury is the smallest and lightest of all the planets.

00:57.320 --> 01:04.360
A mercury year is shorter than a mercury day, which leads to enormous fluctuations in temperature.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.960
Mercury does not have an atmosphere or a moon.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.120
Venus is one of the brightest objects in the Solar System and by far the hottest planet

01:14.120 --> 01:20.760
with atmospheric pressure that is 92 times higher than on Earth.

01:20.760 --> 01:29.320
An out of control greenhouse effect means that Venus never cools below 437 degrees Celsius.

01:29.320 --> 01:33.440
Venus also doesn't have a moon.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.560
Earth is our home and the only planet with temperatures that are moderate enough to allow

01:37.560 --> 01:40.320
for a surplus of liquid water.

01:40.320 --> 01:46.500
Furthermore, it's so far the only place where life is known to exist.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.560
The Earth has one moon.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.520
Venus is the second smallest planet in the Solar System and hardly massive enough to

01:54.520 --> 01:56.880
keep a very thin atmosphere.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.400
Its Olympus Mons is the largest mountain in the Solar System, more than three times as

02:01.400 --> 02:04.440
high as Mount Everest.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.440
Mars has two small moons.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.280
Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in the Solar System.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.760
It consists largely of hydrogen and helium and is the theatre for the largest and most

02:17.760 --> 02:21.260
powerful storms we know.

02:21.260 --> 02:26.160
Its largest storm, the Great Red Spot, is three times as large as Earth.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.880
Jupiter has 67 moons.

02:29.880 --> 02:35.720
Saturn is the second largest planet and possesses the smallest density of all the planets.

02:35.720 --> 02:40.440
If you had a sufficiently large bathtub, Saturn would swim in it.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.580
Saturn is also known for its extended, very visible ring system.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.140
It has 62 moons.

02:48.140 --> 02:52.660
Uranus is the third largest planet and one of the coldest.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.980
Of all the gas giants, it's also the smallest.

02:55.980 --> 03:01.260
The special thing about Uranus is that its axis of rotation is tilted sideways in contrast

03:01.260 --> 03:03.200
to the seven other planets.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.660
It has 27 moons.

03:06.660 --> 03:11.420
Neptune is the last planet in the Solar System and is similar to Uranus.

03:11.540 --> 03:18.540
It's so far removed from the Sun that a Neptune year is 164 Earth years long.

03:18.540 --> 03:24.680
The highest wind speed ever measured was in a storm on Neptune at just under 2,100 kilometers

03:24.680 --> 03:27.820
per hour.

03:27.820 --> 03:32.380
Neptune has 14 moons.

03:32.380 --> 03:38.380
If we compare the sizes of the planets, the differences between them become even clearer.

03:38.740 --> 03:43.220
Jupiter is the leader in terms of size and weight.

03:43.220 --> 03:49.020
Small Mercury, on the other hand, is even smaller than one of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede.

03:49.020 --> 03:54.820
Jupiter is so massive that alone it contains roughly 70% of the mass of all the other planets

03:54.820 --> 03:58.460
and has a massive impact on its surroundings.

03:58.460 --> 04:03.300
That's a blessing for Earth, since Jupiter draws most of the dangerously large asteroids

04:03.300 --> 04:07.520
that could wipe out life on Earth.

04:07.560 --> 04:12.360
But even Jupiter is a dwarf in comparison to our star, the Sun.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.880
Calling it massive does not do justice to the Sun.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.020
It makes up 99.86% of the mass in our Solar System.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.440
For the most part, it consists of hydrogen and helium.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.760
Only less than 2% is made up of heavy elements like oxygen or iron.

04:29.760 --> 04:36.040
At its core, the Sun fuses 620 million tons of hydrogen each second and generates enough

04:36.080 --> 04:41.800
energy to satisfy mankind's needs for years.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.880
But not only the eight planets orbit our Sun.

04:44.880 --> 04:49.220
Trillions of asteroids and comets also circle it.

04:49.220 --> 04:55.280
Most of them are concentrated into two belts, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

04:55.280 --> 04:59.060
and the Kuiper belt at the edge of the Solar System.

04:59.060 --> 05:03.320
These belts are home to countless objects, some as large as a dust particle, others the

05:03.320 --> 05:06.480
size of dwarf planets.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.000
The most well-known object in the asteroid belt is Ceres.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.920
The most well-known objects in the Kuiper belt are Pluto, Makemake and Haumea.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.120
Usually, we describe the asteroid belt as a dense collection of bodies that constantly

05:21.120 --> 05:23.120
collide.

05:23.120 --> 05:28.400
But in fact, the asteroids are distributed across an area that is so indescribably large

05:28.400 --> 05:32.960
that it's even difficult to see two asteroids at once.

05:32.960 --> 05:38.160
Despite the billions of objects in them, the asteroid belts are fairly empty places.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.060
And nonetheless, there are collisions over and over again.

05:42.060 --> 05:45.240
The mass of both belts is also unimpressive.

05:45.240 --> 05:49.900
The asteroid belt has a little less than 4% of our Moon's mass.

05:49.900 --> 05:57.440
And the Kuiper belt is only between 1.25th and 1.10th of Earth's mass.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.660
One day the Solar System will cease to exist.

06:00.660 --> 06:06.800
The Sun will die and Mercury, Venus and maybe Earth too will be destroyed.

06:06.800 --> 06:12.260
In 500 million years, it will become hotter and hotter until at some point it will melt

06:12.260 --> 06:15.600
Earth's crust.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.540
Then the Sun will grow and grow and either swallow Earth or at least turn it into a sea

06:20.540 --> 06:24.700
of lava.

06:24.700 --> 06:29.040
When it has burnt up all its fuel and lost most of its mass, it will shrink to a white

06:29.040 --> 06:36.960
dwarf and burn gently for a few billion more years before it goes out entirely.

06:36.960 --> 06:41.700
Then at the latest, life in the Solar System will no longer be possible.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.280
The Milky Way will not even notice it.

06:44.280 --> 06:49.200
A small part of it in one of its arms will become just a tiny bit darker.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.520
And mankind will cease to exist.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.720
Or leave the Solar System in search of a new home.
