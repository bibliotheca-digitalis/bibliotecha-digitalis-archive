0	4400	In nearly every corner of the earth, ants wage war against each other.
4920	11200	Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor, deadly stingers, or sharp mandibles.
11200	15120	And then there's this tiny and not very impressive ant.
15280	19340	But it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built.
20000	24720	A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave millions of casualties.
25120	28000	Let's take a look at this unlikely warrior-esque.
42000	46560	This story begins in the floodplains around the Paraná River in South America.
47120	52480	It's a crowded ant megalopolis, where dozens of ant species fight for dominance,
52480	57520	including fire ants, army ants, and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant.
58080	62720	It measures only two to three millimeters in length, and with its small mandibles,
62720	66240	it's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors.
67040	72240	Their homes are equally unremarkable. Their colonies range from fairly small to very large,
72240	78400	and can be found anywhere. Under logs, in loose leaf litter, or the former colonies of other ants.
79280	84560	Here, Argentine ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors' bodies.
85360	88960	Most ant species have only one queen to produce ants,
88960	96000	while Argentine ants went all in on numbers. For every 120 workers, there's one queen,
96000	103680	laying up to 60 eggs a day. So their colonies grow fast and have millions or billions of individuals.
104480	109200	Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.
110000	115120	But this strategy has a downside. As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring,
115120	120800	mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments. Their DNA slowly changes from
120800	126240	generation to generation, and differences accumulate. So after a while, the ants that
126240	131120	left the colony will become more like distant cousins and start to compete with their mother
131120	138000	colony. In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants behave. Within their
138000	143440	colonies, they are very cooperative and well organized. But they fight vicious wars against
143440	149840	other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species. With equally strong opponents on every side,
149840	155920	the Argentine ant became extremely aggressive, fighting for every inch of ground. But it could
155920	162800	never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up. We did what humans do and transported things
162800	168800	around the world by ship. On one of them, a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways
168800	175520	from South America to Madeira and New Orleans. The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in
175520	182560	a strange world. Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims. Nobody
182560	188160	could fight them effectively. Because only a few Argentine ant queens were introduced to the
188160	194960	outside world, the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity. On top of that, the introduced
194960	201440	Argentine ants kill up to 90% of their queens every year. Fewer queens, less genetic variation.
202000	207680	So as these colonies spread across the landscape, ants that left the colony were no longer considered
207680	215120	distant cousins. As a result, the new colonies form not opposing, but cooperating parties
215120	221920	called super colonies. This is a very uncommon strategy in the ant kingdom. Only a few of the
221920	228480	16,000 ant species have evolved super colonies. A super colony was established on the west coast
228480	234800	of the USA and became a base for the tiny ants global conquest. Today, the Argentine
234880	240640	ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands. This one super
240640	246800	colony was especially successful, establishing sister locations in California, Europe, Japan,
246800	252880	New Zealand and Australia, forming one massive intercontinental mega colony of Argentine ants.
253520	258320	This makes them the largest society on earth, more numerous than even the human one.
259040	262800	But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded.
263680	270080	California is a perfect example of this. In their greed for more territory, the invading Argentine
270080	276160	ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native ant species, including several species of
276160	282640	Californian carpenter ants. Although carpenter ant workers are giants, their colonies have only
282720	288960	between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no chance against an expanding super colony of
288960	295680	billions of Argentine ants. Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims,
295680	301840	which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants. When they attack,
301840	306880	the Argentine ants wash over their victims, clinging on to their opponents in groups and
306880	311920	pulling apart their limbs. It doesn't matter how many of them die, there are always more.
312800	318320	Once the colony is overrun and exterminated, the Argentine ants feed on their victim's brood
318320	324000	and take over their home and territory. The Argentine ants numbers allow them to hunt down
324000	329520	and devour such an excessive mass of different insects that over time, some species disappear
329520	335360	from the ants territory completely. Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and
335360	341680	fauna, they consume them and move on. And if their next stop happens to be human property,
341680	347520	they will rudely make themselves at home there too. They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food,
347520	353680	and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers. Not just our homes, our gardens and fields are also
353680	359520	impacted by Argentine ants since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle. The aphids
359520	363840	feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew, which they trade with the ants for protection.
364480	370080	Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes, the aphids thrive and ultimately
370080	376240	kill the plants they live on. So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems they invade,
376240	383440	they are also a huge pest for agriculture. But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged.
384080	390080	Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires. A merciless civil war
390080	396000	has broken out. For example, the Lake Hodges super colony has been fighting against the very large
396000	402320	colony for years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line,
402320	409200	stretching over kilometers. An estimated 30 million ants die here each year. On other fronts,
409200	414960	an old acquaintance from the Paraná River has risen from the shadows. Red imported fire ants,
414960	420640	which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama. Not only are the
420640	425840	red fire ants fierce fighters and more than able to deal with the Argentine ant, they are also able
425840	432080	to form super colonies themselves. Now, the old wars from their distant home have been taken to
432080	438240	a foreign battleground. In the southeastern US, the super colonies clashed fiercely.
438240	443920	The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants. The fire ants' major workers are
443920	449280	more than twice the size as the Argentine ants and wield venom-injecting stingers. Even though
449280	454720	the Argentine ants fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them. After countless lost
454720	459920	battles, the red imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants' super colony from much of
459920	465520	the southeastern US. This is one territory lost, but the Argentine ants will fight on.
466240	471360	This amazing network of cooperating super colonies is the biggest success in their history.
472320	477200	And they'll not give it up because of a small defeat. They will stand their ground against
477200	483040	any enemy that might arise, no matter if it's on the Paraná River or on one of the large
483040	495200	battlefields across the world. These videos were developed with the support of CuriosityStream,
