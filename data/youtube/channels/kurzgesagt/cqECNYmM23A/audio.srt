1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
In nearly every corner of the earth, ants wage war against each other.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,200
Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor, deadly stingers, or sharp mandibles.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
And then there's this tiny and not very impressive ant.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,340
But it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave millions of casualties.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's take a look at this unlikely warrior-esque.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,560
This story begins in the floodplains around the Paraná River in South America.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,480
It's a crowded ant megalopolis, where dozens of ant species fight for dominance,

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,520
including fire ants, army ants, and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant.

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,720
It measures only two to three millimeters in length, and with its small mandibles,

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,240
it's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
Their homes are equally unremarkable. Their colonies range from fairly small to very large,

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,400
and can be found anywhere. Under logs, in loose leaf litter, or the former colonies of other ants.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,560
Here, Argentine ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors' bodies.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
Most ant species have only one queen to produce ants,

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,000
while Argentine ants went all in on numbers. For every 120 workers, there's one queen,

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,680
laying up to 60 eggs a day. So their colonies grow fast and have millions or billions of individuals.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,200
Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,120
But this strategy has a downside. As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring,

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,800
mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments. Their DNA slowly changes from

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,240
generation to generation, and differences accumulate. So after a while, the ants that

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
left the colony will become more like distant cousins and start to compete with their mother

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,000
colony. In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants behave. Within their

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,440
colonies, they are very cooperative and well organized. But they fight vicious wars against

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,840
other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species. With equally strong opponents on every side,

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,920
the Argentine ant became extremely aggressive, fighting for every inch of ground. But it could

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,800
never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up. We did what humans do and transported things

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,800
around the world by ship. On one of them, a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,520
from South America to Madeira and New Orleans. The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,560
a strange world. Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims. Nobody

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,160
could fight them effectively. Because only a few Argentine ant queens were introduced to the

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,960
outside world, the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity. On top of that, the introduced

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,440
Argentine ants kill up to 90% of their queens every year. Fewer queens, less genetic variation.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,680
So as these colonies spread across the landscape, ants that left the colony were no longer considered

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,120
distant cousins. As a result, the new colonies form not opposing, but cooperating parties

36
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,920
called super colonies. This is a very uncommon strategy in the ant kingdom. Only a few of the

37
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,480
16,000 ant species have evolved super colonies. A super colony was established on the west coast

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,800
of the USA and became a base for the tiny ants global conquest. Today, the Argentine

39
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,640
ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands. This one super

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,800
colony was especially successful, establishing sister locations in California, Europe, Japan,

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,880
New Zealand and Australia, forming one massive intercontinental mega colony of Argentine ants.

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,320
This makes them the largest society on earth, more numerous than even the human one.

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded.

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
California is a perfect example of this. In their greed for more territory, the invading Argentine

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,160
ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native ant species, including several species of

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,640
Californian carpenter ants. Although carpenter ant workers are giants, their colonies have only

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,960
between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no chance against an expanding super colony of

48
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,680
billions of Argentine ants. Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims,

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,840
which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants. When they attack,

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
the Argentine ants wash over their victims, clinging on to their opponents in groups and

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,920
pulling apart their limbs. It doesn't matter how many of them die, there are always more.

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,320
Once the colony is overrun and exterminated, the Argentine ants feed on their victim's brood

53
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,000
and take over their home and territory. The Argentine ants numbers allow them to hunt down

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,520
and devour such an excessive mass of different insects that over time, some species disappear

55
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,360
from the ants territory completely. Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and

56
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,680
fauna, they consume them and move on. And if their next stop happens to be human property,

57
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,520
they will rudely make themselves at home there too. They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food,

58
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,680
and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers. Not just our homes, our gardens and fields are also

59
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,520
impacted by Argentine ants since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle. The aphids

60
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew, which they trade with the ants for protection.

61
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,080
Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes, the aphids thrive and ultimately

62
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240
kill the plants they live on. So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems they invade,

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,440
they are also a huge pest for agriculture. But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged.

64
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires. A merciless civil war

65
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,000
has broken out. For example, the Lake Hodges super colony has been fighting against the very large

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,320
colony for years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line,

67
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,200
stretching over kilometers. An estimated 30 million ants die here each year. On other fronts,

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,960
an old acquaintance from the Paraná River has risen from the shadows. Red imported fire ants,

69
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,640
which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama. Not only are the

70
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,840
red fire ants fierce fighters and more than able to deal with the Argentine ant, they are also able

71
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,080
to form super colonies themselves. Now, the old wars from their distant home have been taken to

72
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,240
a foreign battleground. In the southeastern US, the super colonies clashed fiercely.

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,920
The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants. The fire ants' major workers are

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,280
more than twice the size as the Argentine ants and wield venom-injecting stingers. Even though

75
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,720
the Argentine ants fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them. After countless lost

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,920
battles, the red imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants' super colony from much of

77
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,520
the southeastern US. This is one territory lost, but the Argentine ants will fight on.

78
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360
This amazing network of cooperating super colonies is the biggest success in their history.

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,200
And they'll not give it up because of a small defeat. They will stand their ground against

80
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,040
any enemy that might arise, no matter if it's on the Paraná River or on one of the large

81
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:15,200
battlefields across the world. These videos were developed with the support of CuriosityStream,
