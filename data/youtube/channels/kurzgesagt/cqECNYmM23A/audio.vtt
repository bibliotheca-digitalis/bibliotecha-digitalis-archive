00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
In nearly every corner of the earth, ants wage war against each other.

00:04.920 --> 00:11.200
Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor, deadly stingers, or sharp mandibles.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.120
And then there's this tiny and not very impressive ant.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.340
But it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.720
A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave millions of casualties.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.000
Let's take a look at this unlikely warrior-esque.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.560
This story begins in the floodplains around the Paraná River in South America.

00:47.120 --> 00:52.480
It's a crowded ant megalopolis, where dozens of ant species fight for dominance,

00:52.480 --> 00:57.520
including fire ants, army ants, and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.720
It measures only two to three millimeters in length, and with its small mandibles,

01:02.720 --> 01:06.240
it's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors.

01:07.040 --> 01:12.240
Their homes are equally unremarkable. Their colonies range from fairly small to very large,

01:12.240 --> 01:18.400
and can be found anywhere. Under logs, in loose leaf litter, or the former colonies of other ants.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.560
Here, Argentine ants prepare their most effective weapon against their competitors' bodies.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.960
Most ant species have only one queen to produce ants,

01:28.960 --> 01:36.000
while Argentine ants went all in on numbers. For every 120 workers, there's one queen,

01:36.000 --> 01:43.680
laying up to 60 eggs a day. So their colonies grow fast and have millions or billions of individuals.

01:44.480 --> 01:49.200
Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.120
But this strategy has a downside. As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring,

01:55.120 --> 02:00.800
mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments. Their DNA slowly changes from

02:00.800 --> 02:06.240
generation to generation, and differences accumulate. So after a while, the ants that

02:06.240 --> 02:11.120
left the colony will become more like distant cousins and start to compete with their mother

02:11.120 --> 02:18.000
colony. In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants behave. Within their

02:18.000 --> 02:23.440
colonies, they are very cooperative and well organized. But they fight vicious wars against

02:23.440 --> 02:29.840
other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species. With equally strong opponents on every side,

02:29.840 --> 02:35.920
the Argentine ant became extremely aggressive, fighting for every inch of ground. But it could

02:35.920 --> 02:42.800
never dominate its neighbors until humans showed up. We did what humans do and transported things

02:42.800 --> 02:48.800
around the world by ship. On one of them, a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways

02:48.800 --> 02:55.520
from South America to Madeira and New Orleans. The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in

02:55.520 --> 03:02.560
a strange world. Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims. Nobody

03:02.560 --> 03:08.160
could fight them effectively. Because only a few Argentine ant queens were introduced to the

03:08.160 --> 03:14.960
outside world, the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity. On top of that, the introduced

03:14.960 --> 03:21.440
Argentine ants kill up to 90% of their queens every year. Fewer queens, less genetic variation.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.680
So as these colonies spread across the landscape, ants that left the colony were no longer considered

03:27.680 --> 03:35.120
distant cousins. As a result, the new colonies form not opposing, but cooperating parties

03:35.120 --> 03:41.920
called super colonies. This is a very uncommon strategy in the ant kingdom. Only a few of the

03:41.920 --> 03:48.480
16,000 ant species have evolved super colonies. A super colony was established on the west coast

03:48.480 --> 03:54.800
of the USA and became a base for the tiny ants global conquest. Today, the Argentine

03:54.880 --> 04:00.640
ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands. This one super

04:00.640 --> 04:06.800
colony was especially successful, establishing sister locations in California, Europe, Japan,

04:06.800 --> 04:12.880
New Zealand and Australia, forming one massive intercontinental mega colony of Argentine ants.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.320
This makes them the largest society on earth, more numerous than even the human one.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.800
But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded.

04:23.680 --> 04:30.080
California is a perfect example of this. In their greed for more territory, the invading Argentine

04:30.080 --> 04:36.160
ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native ant species, including several species of

04:36.160 --> 04:42.640
Californian carpenter ants. Although carpenter ant workers are giants, their colonies have only

04:42.720 --> 04:48.960
between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no chance against an expanding super colony of

04:48.960 --> 04:55.680
billions of Argentine ants. Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims,

04:55.680 --> 05:01.840
which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants. When they attack,

05:01.840 --> 05:06.880
the Argentine ants wash over their victims, clinging on to their opponents in groups and

05:06.880 --> 05:11.920
pulling apart their limbs. It doesn't matter how many of them die, there are always more.

05:12.800 --> 05:18.320
Once the colony is overrun and exterminated, the Argentine ants feed on their victim's brood

05:18.320 --> 05:24.000
and take over their home and territory. The Argentine ants numbers allow them to hunt down

05:24.000 --> 05:29.520
and devour such an excessive mass of different insects that over time, some species disappear

05:29.520 --> 05:35.360
from the ants territory completely. Argentine ants don't care about working with the local flora and

05:35.360 --> 05:41.680
fauna, they consume them and move on. And if their next stop happens to be human property,

05:41.680 --> 05:47.520
they will rudely make themselves at home there too. They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food,

05:47.520 --> 05:53.680
and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers. Not just our homes, our gardens and fields are also

05:53.680 --> 05:59.520
impacted by Argentine ants since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle. The aphids

05:59.520 --> 06:03.840
feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew, which they trade with the ants for protection.

06:04.480 --> 06:10.080
Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes, the aphids thrive and ultimately

06:10.080 --> 06:16.240
kill the plants they live on. So on top of being a major disruption for the ecosystems they invade,

06:16.240 --> 06:23.440
they are also a huge pest for agriculture. But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged.

06:24.080 --> 06:30.080
Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires. A merciless civil war

06:30.080 --> 06:36.000
has broken out. For example, the Lake Hodges super colony has been fighting against the very large

06:36.000 --> 06:42.320
colony for years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line,

06:42.320 --> 06:49.200
stretching over kilometers. An estimated 30 million ants die here each year. On other fronts,

06:49.200 --> 06:54.960
an old acquaintance from the Paraná River has risen from the shadows. Red imported fire ants,

06:54.960 --> 07:00.640
which were accidentally introduced from their old home to the coast of Alabama. Not only are the

07:00.640 --> 07:05.840
red fire ants fierce fighters and more than able to deal with the Argentine ant, they are also able

07:05.840 --> 07:12.080
to form super colonies themselves. Now, the old wars from their distant home have been taken to

07:12.080 --> 07:18.240
a foreign battleground. In the southeastern US, the super colonies clashed fiercely.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.920
The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants. The fire ants' major workers are

07:23.920 --> 07:29.280
more than twice the size as the Argentine ants and wield venom-injecting stingers. Even though

07:29.280 --> 07:34.720
the Argentine ants fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them. After countless lost

07:34.720 --> 07:39.920
battles, the red imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants' super colony from much of

07:39.920 --> 07:45.520
the southeastern US. This is one territory lost, but the Argentine ants will fight on.

07:46.240 --> 07:51.360
This amazing network of cooperating super colonies is the biggest success in their history.

07:52.320 --> 07:57.200
And they'll not give it up because of a small defeat. They will stand their ground against

07:57.200 --> 08:03.040
any enemy that might arise, no matter if it's on the Paraná River or on one of the large

08:03.040 --> 08:15.200
battlefields across the world. These videos were developed with the support of CuriosityStream,
