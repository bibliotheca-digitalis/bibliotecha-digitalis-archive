0	8600	Humans love meat. Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things.
8600	15000	Eating meat has become so trivial that many people don't consider something a proper meal if there's no animal involved.
15000	20500	Which is pretty amazing, since only a few decades ago, meat was a luxury product.
20500	24000	Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.
24000	29500	Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the most inefficient way of feeding humans.
29500	35500	If we look at it on a global scale, our meaty diet is literally eating up the planet.
35500	40500	Why is that, and what can we do about it without giving up steak?
40500	52000	Humans keep a lot of animals for food.
52000	59500	Currently, about 23 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cattle, and roughly 1 billion pigs and sheep.
59500	65500	That's a lot of mouths to feed, so we've transformed Earth into a giant feeding ground.
66000	74000	83% of its farmland is used for livestock, for example as pasture, and to farm fodder crops like corn and soy.
74000	78000	That's 26% of Earth's total land area.
78000	86500	If we include the water we need for these plants, meat and dairy production accounts for 27% of global fresh water consumption.
86500	92000	Unfortunately, meat production is like a black hole for resources.
92500	99500	Since animals are living things, most of their food is used to keep them alive while they grow their tasty parts.
99500	105500	Only a fraction of the nutrients from fodder crops end up in the meat we buy in the end.
105500	114500	Cows, for example, convert only about 4% of the proteins and 3% of the calories of the plants we feed to them into beef.
114500	119500	More than 97% of the calories are lost to us.
119500	129000	To create 1 kilogram of steak, a cow needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and uses up to 15,000 liters of water.
129000	136000	Animal products are guzzling up tons of food, but they only make up 18% of the calories humans eat.
136000	144000	According to projections, we could nourish an additional 3.5 billion people if we just ate the stuff we feed to animals.
144500	154000	To make our favorite food group even more unsustainable, about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are created by the meat industry.
154000	159000	As much as by all ships, planes, trucks and cars combined.
159000	164500	And there's another aspect to meat. It comes from actual living beings.
164500	173500	Pigs, cattle and chicken are not the ones writing the history books, but if they were, humans would appear as rampant genocidal maniacs that thrive on suffering.
174000	182000	Globally, we kill about 200 million animals every day. About 74 billion a year.
182000	192000	This means that every one and a half years, we kill more animals than people have lived in the entire 200,000 year history of humanity.
192000	198000	One could argue that we're doing them a favor. After all, they wouldn't exist without us.
198000	204000	We might eat them in the end, but we also provide food and shelter and the gift of existence to them.
204000	207500	Unfortunately, we're not very nice gods.
207500	214000	A lot of our meat comes from factory farms, huge industrial systems that house thousands of animals.
214000	220000	Engineered to be as efficient as possible, they have little regard for things like quality of life.
220000	226000	Most pigs are raised in gigantic windowless sheds and never get to see the sun.
226000	235000	Sows are kept in pens too small to turn around, where they give birth to one litter of piglets after another until it's their turn to be turned into bacon.
235000	243000	Dairy cows are forced to breed continually to ensure their milk supply, but are separated from their calves hours after birth.
243000	251000	To fasten up beef cattle for slaughter, they're put in feedlots, confined pens where they can't roam, and put on weight more quickly.
251000	261000	To make it possible to keep them so tightly together without dying of diseases, the majority of antibiotics we use are for livestock, up to 80% in the US.
261000	266000	Which helps in the short term, but also fuels antibiotic resistances.
266000	270000	But the ones that may have got the worst deal are chickens.
270000	280000	In factory farms, they're kept in such vast numbers and so close to each other that they can't form the social structures they have in nature, so they start attacking each other.
280000	283000	To stop that, we cut their beaks and claws.
283000	289000	Male chickens are deemed worthless, since they can't lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production.
289000	294000	So within minutes after birth, they're usually gassed and shredded in grinders.
294000	298000	Several hundred million baby chickens are killed this way each year.
298000	304000	Even if you had a personal score to settle with chickens, how we treat them is beyond broken.
304000	309000	So, better buy organic meat, where animals are treated nicely, right?
309000	314000	Organic farming regulations are designed to grant animals a minimum of comfort.
314000	318000	The problem is that organic is an elastic term.
318000	324000	According to EU regulations, an organic hen still might share one square meter of space with five others.
324000	328000	That's a long way off from happy farmyard chickens.
328000	332000	Farms that sincerely do their best do exist, of course.
332000	334000	But meat is still a business.
334000	337000	An organic label is a way to charge more money,
337000	341000	and countless scandals have revealed producers looking for ways to cheat the system.
341000	348000	And while organic meat might be less cruel, it needs even more resources than conventional meat production.
348000	354000	So buying organic is still preferable, but does not grant you moral absolution.
354000	360000	The truth is, if suffering were a resource, we would create billions of tons of it per year.
360000	366000	The way we treat animals will probably be one of the things future generations will look down on in disgust.
366000	370000	While all these things are true, something else is true too.
370000	373000	Steak is amazing.
373000	375000	Burgers are the best food.
375000	377000	Chicken wings taste great.
377000	381000	Meat satisfies something buried deep in our lizard brain.
381000	386000	We hardly ever see how our meat is made, we just eat it and love it.
386000	391000	It creates joy, it brings us together for family meals and barbecue parties.
391000	396000	Eating meat doesn't make you a bad person, not eating meat doesn't make you a good one.
396000	400000	Life is complicated, and so is the world we've created.
400000	408000	So, how should we deal with the fact that meat is extremely unsustainable and a sort of horrible torture?
408000	412000	For now, the easiest option is opting out more often.
412000	415000	Taking a meat-free day per week already makes a difference.
415000	423000	If you want to eat meat produced with less suffering, try to buy from trusted producers with a good track record, even if it costs more.
423000	431000	To make an impact on the environment, go for chicken and pig rather than lamb and beef as they convert their feed more efficiently into meat.
431000	436000	And if you're going to have your steak, you should eat it too.
436000	441000	An average American throws out nearly a pound of food per day, a lot of which is meat.
442000	445000	In the future, science could get us clean meat.
445000	452000	Various startups have successfully grown meat in labs and are working on doing so on a commercial scale.
452000	455000	But solutions like this are still a few years away.
455000	459000	For now, enjoy your steak, but also respect it.
459000	463000	And if you can, make it something special again.
