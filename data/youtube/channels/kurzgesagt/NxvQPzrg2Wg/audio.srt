1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Humans love meat. Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages are just the best things.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,000
Eating meat has become so trivial that many people don't consider something a proper meal if there's no animal involved.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Which is pretty amazing, since only a few decades ago, meat was a luxury product.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Today, you can get a cheeseburger for a dollar.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the most inefficient way of feeding humans.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,500
If we look at it on a global scale, our meaty diet is literally eating up the planet.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Why is that, and what can we do about it without giving up steak?

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Humans keep a lot of animals for food.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Currently, about 23 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cattle, and roughly 1 billion pigs and sheep.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
That's a lot of mouths to feed, so we've transformed Earth into a giant feeding ground.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
83% of its farmland is used for livestock, for example as pasture, and to farm fodder crops like corn and soy.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's 26% of Earth's total land area.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,500
If we include the water we need for these plants, meat and dairy production accounts for 27% of global fresh water consumption.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Unfortunately, meat production is like a black hole for resources.

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Since animals are living things, most of their food is used to keep them alive while they grow their tasty parts.

16
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Only a fraction of the nutrients from fodder crops end up in the meat we buy in the end.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Cows, for example, convert only about 4% of the proteins and 3% of the calories of the plants we feed to them into beef.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,500
More than 97% of the calories are lost to us.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:09,000
To create 1 kilogram of steak, a cow needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and uses up to 15,000 liters of water.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Animal products are guzzling up tons of food, but they only make up 18% of the calories humans eat.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
According to projections, we could nourish an additional 3.5 billion people if we just ate the stuff we feed to animals.

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:34,000
To make our favorite food group even more unsustainable, about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are created by the meat industry.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
As much as by all ships, planes, trucks and cars combined.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,500
And there's another aspect to meat. It comes from actual living beings.

25
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Pigs, cattle and chicken are not the ones writing the history books, but if they were, humans would appear as rampant genocidal maniacs that thrive on suffering.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Globally, we kill about 200 million animals every day. About 74 billion a year.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This means that every one and a half years, we kill more animals than people have lived in the entire 200,000 year history of humanity.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
One could argue that we're doing them a favor. After all, they wouldn't exist without us.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We might eat them in the end, but we also provide food and shelter and the gift of existence to them.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Unfortunately, we're not very nice gods.

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,000
A lot of our meat comes from factory farms, huge industrial systems that house thousands of animals.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Engineered to be as efficient as possible, they have little regard for things like quality of life.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Most pigs are raised in gigantic windowless sheds and never get to see the sun.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sows are kept in pens too small to turn around, where they give birth to one litter of piglets after another until it's their turn to be turned into bacon.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Dairy cows are forced to breed continually to ensure their milk supply, but are separated from their calves hours after birth.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To fasten up beef cattle for slaughter, they're put in feedlots, confined pens where they can't roam, and put on weight more quickly.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
To make it possible to keep them so tightly together without dying of diseases, the majority of antibiotics we use are for livestock, up to 80% in the US.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Which helps in the short term, but also fuels antibiotic resistances.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the ones that may have got the worst deal are chickens.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In factory farms, they're kept in such vast numbers and so close to each other that they can't form the social structures they have in nature, so they start attacking each other.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
To stop that, we cut their beaks and claws.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Male chickens are deemed worthless, since they can't lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So within minutes after birth, they're usually gassed and shredded in grinders.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Several hundred million baby chickens are killed this way each year.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Even if you had a personal score to settle with chickens, how we treat them is beyond broken.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, better buy organic meat, where animals are treated nicely, right?

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Organic farming regulations are designed to grant animals a minimum of comfort.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The problem is that organic is an elastic term.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
According to EU regulations, an organic hen still might share one square meter of space with five others.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's a long way off from happy farmyard chickens.

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Farms that sincerely do their best do exist, of course.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But meat is still a business.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
An organic label is a way to charge more money,

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and countless scandals have revealed producers looking for ways to cheat the system.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And while organic meat might be less cruel, it needs even more resources than conventional meat production.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So buying organic is still preferable, but does not grant you moral absolution.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The truth is, if suffering were a resource, we would create billions of tons of it per year.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The way we treat animals will probably be one of the things future generations will look down on in disgust.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
While all these things are true, something else is true too.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Steak is amazing.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Burgers are the best food.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Chicken wings taste great.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Meat satisfies something buried deep in our lizard brain.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We hardly ever see how our meat is made, we just eat it and love it.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It creates joy, it brings us together for family meals and barbecue parties.

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Eating meat doesn't make you a bad person, not eating meat doesn't make you a good one.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Life is complicated, and so is the world we've created.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, how should we deal with the fact that meat is extremely unsustainable and a sort of horrible torture?

69
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For now, the easiest option is opting out more often.

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Taking a meat-free day per week already makes a difference.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you want to eat meat produced with less suffering, try to buy from trusted producers with a good track record, even if it costs more.

72
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
To make an impact on the environment, go for chicken and pig rather than lamb and beef as they convert their feed more efficiently into meat.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And if you're going to have your steak, you should eat it too.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
An average American throws out nearly a pound of food per day, a lot of which is meat.

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In the future, science could get us clean meat.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Various startups have successfully grown meat in labs and are working on doing so on a commercial scale.

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But solutions like this are still a few years away.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
For now, enjoy your steak, but also respect it.

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And if you can, make it something special again.

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have something else for you that's also special and tastes even better than steak.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
