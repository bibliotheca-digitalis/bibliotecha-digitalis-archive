0	5580	There's this idea floating around that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
5580	8460	That surviving a disease leaves you better off.
8460	11680	And it seems to make sense because we've all experienced this.
11680	15920	When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult
15920	17800	situation in the future.
17800	23000	But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn't kill you makes you weaker.
23000	25120	So what happens when you get sick?
30000	36540	The machinery of war.
36540	40960	Think of yourself as a large country, with a sizable army to defend it.
40960	46440	You're surrounded by enemies that want to take your land, your energy, your resources.
46440	50680	This is a matter of life and death, so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and
50680	52760	to the presence of enemies.
52760	56800	Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment, and that it has to act
56800	57800	fast.
57800	61840	Let's start an invasion and see what happens.
61840	66240	The moment your cells notice that something is off, they release an onslaught of signal
66240	68840	proteins called cytokines.
68840	73320	They're like aerate sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells that then themselves
73320	76480	release many more cytokines, amplifying the alarm.
76480	81340	Soon, you're flooded with signals that trigger precautions and countermeasures.
81340	83980	Mobilization is underway.
83980	89500	Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body's priorities to defense.
89500	93580	The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy.
93580	98560	You feel apathetic, often anxious or down, and you lose your appetite.
98560	102400	Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest.
102400	107840	All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response.
107840	112880	You become a country under attack switching into a war economy, because properly activating
112880	116980	your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining.
116980	121300	Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks, your
121300	126380	immune system demands huge amounts of energy, amino acids, and micro-elements to build its
126380	127720	weapons.
127720	128860	Take fever.
128860	133360	It speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster while creating
133360	139260	heat that's pretty stressful for many invaders, but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain.
139260	144440	Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells to respond specifically
144440	146580	to the enemy infecting you.
146580	151620	B cells produce millions of antibodies every second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids
151620	153420	to construct.
153420	157860	Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system,
157860	160460	a minefield inside your blood.
160460	166340	Cytokines, the mobilization and information signals, also need constant refreshing.
166340	171400	Usually you acquire your resources by eating, but when you're sick, your body slows down
171400	175340	your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can't spare.
175340	180500	So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles.
180500	186160	All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive.
186160	190400	If you're young and healthy and fit, you'll make up for that quickly once you're better.
190400	195260	But if you're old or very young, weak or suffer from chronic illness, this may be way too
196220	200580	Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going.
200580	204700	If your whole system is already strained, when you get sick, just keeping your immune
204700	208900	responses going can overwhelm your capacities.
208900	212820	Your immune system is a jerk, our enemies too.
212820	216900	Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies.
216900	221000	There's a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral
221000	223340	damage caused by immune cells.
223340	226300	One of your first responders are neutrophils.
226300	229380	Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns.
229380	234560	If a neutrophil encounters enemies, it showers them with chemicals that cut them open, but
234560	239100	can also damage civilian cells, especially if the patient is already compromised, for
239100	241140	example by smoking.
241140	246300	On top of that, the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins that
246300	249020	can cause significant damage and cell death.
249020	255380	So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds, literally holes in your organs.
255380	259340	As you can imagine, it's not great to have holes and wounds in your organs, and your
259340	261540	body rushes to close them.
261540	267220	Your neutrophils and macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs,
267220	270900	and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells.
270900	275460	But others are filled with collagen, a sort of fixal organic cement that gives your gooey
275460	277940	tissue structural integrity.
277980	280860	You've seen the result on your skin as scars.
280860	283380	A scar is different from the original tissue.
283380	287700	It has no functioning cells in it, it's like a sloppily applied cement patch.
287700	290660	It can't do what the original tissue was doing.
290660	294220	A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker.
294220	297540	A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen.
297540	301180	A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter.
301180	305220	And so as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease, the
305220	308100	functionality of your organs may decrease.
308100	313660	The damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life, but can be permanent.
313660	318300	Okay, this sounds depressing, but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot
318300	322140	of this damage and train your immune system.
322140	325300	The best way to train your immune system.
325300	327660	Your immune system is unique.
327660	331780	Everyone has a slightly different immune system that's stronger against some enemies and weaker
331780	336340	against others, which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects our species from being
336340	338660	wiped out by a single infection.
338660	342980	Collectively, the immune system of the human species is a spectrum.
342980	347540	Most people respond well enough to an infection, a few are super responders, and a few don't
347540	349960	respond well and die.
349960	355580	Some people survive the Black Death are more resistant to HIV or Coronavirus, or even resistant
355580	357300	against Ebola.
357300	362860	Others are killed easily by the flu, or are highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections.
362860	366100	Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict.
366100	370220	And you also respond differently to every possible infection.
370220	375380	This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from COVID, while for some elderly people,
375380	378100	it was more like a mild flu.
378100	382760	The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong.
382760	387060	You never know what your immune system is good at until it's tested.
387060	393280	Getting sick is a gamble in life's casino with your health on the line, always.
393280	398780	But there is something you can do, hacking one of the best features of your immune system.
398780	403300	When you survive a disease, usually you have better defenses against it afterwards.
403300	406780	You gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that
406780	407780	day.
407780	412820	So you either don't get the disease again, or the next infection is much milder.
412820	417320	And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism
417320	422060	to prevent damage from disease and train your immune system.
422060	423620	Vaccines.
423620	427820	Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it
427820	429580	ever shows up for real.
429580	434780	The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection.
434780	439360	But if you can feel some side effects, why should you still do it?
439360	442580	Nature versus vaccine dojo.
442580	445780	You have two options to train your immune system.
445780	448940	Vaccine dojo and nature dojo.
448940	453340	In vaccine dojo, you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself.
453340	456700	Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise.
456700	461100	Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for a few days, but that's generally it.
461100	463660	No scars, no permanent damage.
463660	468360	We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more.
468360	473500	On the other hand, getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo.
473500	478660	In nature dojo, you train with real weapons, sharp knives and saws.
478660	482700	Things might still work out, but with way more cuts and wounds.
482700	488900	But from time to time, someone will die, be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza.
488900	491560	Nature dojo is just way more risky.
491560	495800	On top of that, the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural
495800	500080	resistance because they're engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive
500080	501080	way.
501080	505600	Of course, vaccines are not magic, and sometimes they don't protect us as well as we'd like
505600	506840	them to.
506840	511540	Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly, like the Omicron coronavirus, or because your
511540	516760	specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense.
516760	522800	Still, being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses.
522800	527900	In the end, if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century, eventually
527900	530620	we may overcome disease for good.
530620	535100	But until then, we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others.
535100	540940	Your body and your older self will be grateful to you.
540940	544540	Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together.
544540	549340	We believe the same is true for climate change, one of the main challenges of our generation.
549340	554420	We're very passionate about this topic, and we've covered it extensively in previous videos.
554420	558860	Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different levels of society, from governments and economies
558860	560780	down to the individual.
560780	565180	And there's one way you can take action now, by working with our friends from Wren, who
565180	567740	help you offset your carbon emissions.
567740	571860	By visiting Wren.co and answering a few questions, you can find out what your personal carbon
571860	573960	footprint is.
573960	578200	Your first step should be reducing your footprint, but there are limits to that.
578200	582120	Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription that
582120	586520	supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from
586520	587520	the sky.
587520	590980	We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate
590980	591980	crisis.
591980	595320	Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution, you'll get pictures and updates from the
595320	599480	project you support, so you can directly see the impact you're making.
599480	604000	We appreciate Wren's focus on transparency and impact, so you can always retrace how
604000	605760	your money is spent.
605760	609920	One project we find especially interesting is refrigerant destruction.
609920	613260	Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant.
613260	617640	These gases, once released into the atmosphere, cause global warming thousands of times faster
617640	618640	than CO2.
618640	623440	Wren's project permanently destroys containers filled with these gases, proving with high
623440	627560	certainty that they'll never leak and contribute to global warming.
627560	632000	Sign up through Wren.co slash Kurzgesagt to start helping the planet.
632000	635880	As climate change is close to our hearts, we will personally pay for the first month
635880	640560	of subscription for the first 200 people to sign up.
