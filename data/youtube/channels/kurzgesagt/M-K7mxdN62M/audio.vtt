00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
There's this idea floating around that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

00:05.580 --> 00:08.460
That surviving a disease leaves you better off.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.680
And it seems to make sense because we've all experienced this.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.920
When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult

00:15.920 --> 00:17.800
situation in the future.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.000
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn't kill you makes you weaker.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.120
So what happens when you get sick?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.540
The machinery of war.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.960
Think of yourself as a large country, with a sizable army to defend it.

00:40.960 --> 00:46.440
You're surrounded by enemies that want to take your land, your energy, your resources.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.680
This is a matter of life and death, so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and

00:50.680 --> 00:52.760
to the presence of enemies.

00:52.760 --> 00:56.800
Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment, and that it has to act

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
fast.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.840
Let's start an invasion and see what happens.

01:01.840 --> 01:06.240
The moment your cells notice that something is off, they release an onslaught of signal

01:06.240 --> 01:08.840
proteins called cytokines.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.320
They're like aerate sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells that then themselves

01:13.320 --> 01:16.480
release many more cytokines, amplifying the alarm.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.340
Soon, you're flooded with signals that trigger precautions and countermeasures.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.980
Mobilization is underway.

01:23.980 --> 01:29.500
Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body's priorities to defense.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.580
The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy.

01:33.580 --> 01:38.560
You feel apathetic, often anxious or down, and you lose your appetite.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.400
Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.840
All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response.

01:47.840 --> 01:52.880
You become a country under attack switching into a war economy, because properly activating

01:52.880 --> 01:56.980
your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining.

01:56.980 --> 02:01.300
Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks, your

02:01.300 --> 02:06.380
immune system demands huge amounts of energy, amino acids, and micro-elements to build its

02:06.380 --> 02:07.720
weapons.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.860
Take fever.

02:08.860 --> 02:13.360
It speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster while creating

02:13.360 --> 02:19.260
heat that's pretty stressful for many invaders, but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain.

02:19.260 --> 02:24.440
Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells to respond specifically

02:24.440 --> 02:26.580
to the enemy infecting you.

02:26.580 --> 02:31.620
B cells produce millions of antibodies every second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids

02:31.620 --> 02:33.420
to construct.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.860
Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system,

02:37.860 --> 02:40.460
a minefield inside your blood.

02:40.460 --> 02:46.340
Cytokines, the mobilization and information signals, also need constant refreshing.

02:46.340 --> 02:51.400
Usually you acquire your resources by eating, but when you're sick, your body slows down

02:51.400 --> 02:55.340
your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can't spare.

02:55.340 --> 03:00.500
So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles.

03:00.500 --> 03:06.160
All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.400
If you're young and healthy and fit, you'll make up for that quickly once you're better.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.260
But if you're old or very young, weak or suffer from chronic illness, this may be way too

03:16.220 --> 03:20.580
Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going.

03:20.580 --> 03:24.700
If your whole system is already strained, when you get sick, just keeping your immune

03:24.700 --> 03:28.900
responses going can overwhelm your capacities.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.820
Your immune system is a jerk, our enemies too.

03:32.820 --> 03:36.900
Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.000
There's a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral

03:41.000 --> 03:43.340
damage caused by immune cells.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.300
One of your first responders are neutrophils.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.380
Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns.

03:49.380 --> 03:54.560
If a neutrophil encounters enemies, it showers them with chemicals that cut them open, but

03:54.560 --> 03:59.100
can also damage civilian cells, especially if the patient is already compromised, for

03:59.100 --> 04:01.140
example by smoking.

04:01.140 --> 04:06.300
On top of that, the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins that

04:06.300 --> 04:09.020
can cause significant damage and cell death.

04:09.020 --> 04:15.380
So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds, literally holes in your organs.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.340
As you can imagine, it's not great to have holes and wounds in your organs, and your

04:19.340 --> 04:21.540
body rushes to close them.

04:21.540 --> 04:27.220
Your neutrophils and macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs,

04:27.220 --> 04:30.900
and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.460
But others are filled with collagen, a sort of fixal organic cement that gives your gooey

04:35.460 --> 04:37.940
tissue structural integrity.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.860
You've seen the result on your skin as scars.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.380
A scar is different from the original tissue.

04:43.380 --> 04:47.700
It has no functioning cells in it, it's like a sloppily applied cement patch.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.660
It can't do what the original tissue was doing.

04:50.660 --> 04:54.220
A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker.

04:54.220 --> 04:57.540
A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen.

04:57.540 --> 05:01.180
A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter.

05:01.180 --> 05:05.220
And so as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease, the

05:05.220 --> 05:08.100
functionality of your organs may decrease.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.660
The damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life, but can be permanent.

05:13.660 --> 05:18.300
Okay, this sounds depressing, but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot

05:18.300 --> 05:22.140
of this damage and train your immune system.

05:22.140 --> 05:25.300
The best way to train your immune system.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.660
Your immune system is unique.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.780
Everyone has a slightly different immune system that's stronger against some enemies and weaker

05:31.780 --> 05:36.340
against others, which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects our species from being

05:36.340 --> 05:38.660
wiped out by a single infection.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.980
Collectively, the immune system of the human species is a spectrum.

05:42.980 --> 05:47.540
Most people respond well enough to an infection, a few are super responders, and a few don't

05:47.540 --> 05:49.960
respond well and die.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.580
Some people survive the Black Death are more resistant to HIV or Coronavirus, or even resistant

05:55.580 --> 05:57.300
against Ebola.

05:57.300 --> 06:02.860
Others are killed easily by the flu, or are highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.100
Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict.

06:06.100 --> 06:10.220
And you also respond differently to every possible infection.

06:10.220 --> 06:15.380
This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from COVID, while for some elderly people,

06:15.380 --> 06:18.100
it was more like a mild flu.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.760
The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong.

06:22.760 --> 06:27.060
You never know what your immune system is good at until it's tested.

06:27.060 --> 06:33.280
Getting sick is a gamble in life's casino with your health on the line, always.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.780
But there is something you can do, hacking one of the best features of your immune system.

06:38.780 --> 06:43.300
When you survive a disease, usually you have better defenses against it afterwards.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.780
You gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that

06:46.780 --> 06:47.780
day.

06:47.780 --> 06:52.820
So you either don't get the disease again, or the next infection is much milder.

06:52.820 --> 06:57.320
And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism

06:57.320 --> 07:02.060
to prevent damage from disease and train your immune system.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.620
Vaccines.

07:03.620 --> 07:07.820
Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it

07:07.820 --> 07:09.580
ever shows up for real.

07:09.580 --> 07:14.780
The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection.

07:14.780 --> 07:19.360
But if you can feel some side effects, why should you still do it?

07:19.360 --> 07:22.580
Nature versus vaccine dojo.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.780
You have two options to train your immune system.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.940
Vaccine dojo and nature dojo.

07:28.940 --> 07:33.340
In vaccine dojo, you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself.

07:33.340 --> 07:36.700
Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise.

07:36.700 --> 07:41.100
Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for a few days, but that's generally it.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.660
No scars, no permanent damage.

07:43.660 --> 07:48.360
We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more.

07:48.360 --> 07:53.500
On the other hand, getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo.

07:53.500 --> 07:58.660
In nature dojo, you train with real weapons, sharp knives and saws.

07:58.660 --> 08:02.700
Things might still work out, but with way more cuts and wounds.

08:02.700 --> 08:08.900
But from time to time, someone will die, be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.560
Nature dojo is just way more risky.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.800
On top of that, the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural

08:15.800 --> 08:20.080
resistance because they're engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
way.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.600
Of course, vaccines are not magic, and sometimes they don't protect us as well as we'd like

08:25.600 --> 08:26.840
them to.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.540
Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly, like the Omicron coronavirus, or because your

08:31.540 --> 08:36.760
specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense.

08:36.760 --> 08:42.800
Still, being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.900
In the end, if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century, eventually

08:47.900 --> 08:50.620
we may overcome disease for good.

08:50.620 --> 08:55.100
But until then, we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others.

08:55.100 --> 09:00.940
Your body and your older self will be grateful to you.

09:00.940 --> 09:04.540
Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together.

09:04.540 --> 09:09.340
We believe the same is true for climate change, one of the main challenges of our generation.

09:09.340 --> 09:14.420
We're very passionate about this topic, and we've covered it extensively in previous videos.

09:14.420 --> 09:18.860
Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different levels of society, from governments and economies

09:18.860 --> 09:20.780
down to the individual.

09:20.780 --> 09:25.180
And there's one way you can take action now, by working with our friends from Wren, who

09:25.180 --> 09:27.740
help you offset your carbon emissions.

09:27.740 --> 09:31.860
By visiting Wren.co and answering a few questions, you can find out what your personal carbon

09:31.860 --> 09:33.960
footprint is.

09:33.960 --> 09:38.200
Your first step should be reducing your footprint, but there are limits to that.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.120
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription that

09:42.120 --> 09:46.520
supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from

09:46.520 --> 09:47.520
the sky.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.980
We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate

09:50.980 --> 09:51.980
crisis.

09:51.980 --> 09:55.320
Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution, you'll get pictures and updates from the

09:55.320 --> 09:59.480
project you support, so you can directly see the impact you're making.

09:59.480 --> 10:04.000
We appreciate Wren's focus on transparency and impact, so you can always retrace how

10:04.000 --> 10:05.760
your money is spent.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.920
One project we find especially interesting is refrigerant destruction.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.260
Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant.

10:13.260 --> 10:17.640
These gases, once released into the atmosphere, cause global warming thousands of times faster

10:17.640 --> 10:18.640
than CO2.

10:18.640 --> 10:23.440
Wren's project permanently destroys containers filled with these gases, proving with high

10:23.440 --> 10:27.560
certainty that they'll never leak and contribute to global warming.

10:27.560 --> 10:32.000
Sign up through Wren.co slash Kurzgesagt to start helping the planet.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.880
As climate change is close to our hearts, we will personally pay for the first month

10:35.880 --> 10:40.560
of subscription for the first 200 people to sign up.
