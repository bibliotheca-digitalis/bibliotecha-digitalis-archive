1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
There's this idea floating around that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,460
That surviving a disease leaves you better off.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,680
And it seems to make sense because we've all experienced this.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,920
When you go through hardship, often you come out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,800
situation in the future.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,000
But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn't kill you makes you weaker.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
So what happens when you get sick?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,540
The machinery of war.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,960
Think of yourself as a large country, with a sizable army to defend it.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,440
You're surrounded by enemies that want to take your land, your energy, your resources.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,680
This is a matter of life and death, so your body evolved to be sensitive to damage and

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,760
to the presence of enemies.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,800
Because this means that an invasion might happen at any moment, and that it has to act

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
fast.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Let's start an invasion and see what happens.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
The moment your cells notice that something is off, they release an onslaught of signal

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,840
proteins called cytokines.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,320
They're like aerate sirens that activate all sorts of immune cells that then themselves

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,480
release many more cytokines, amplifying the alarm.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,340
Soon, you're flooded with signals that trigger precautions and countermeasures.

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,980
Mobilization is underway.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,500
Your brain activates sickness behavior and reorganizes your body's priorities to defense.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,580
The first thing you notice is that your energy level drops and you get sleepy.

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,560
You feel apathetic, often anxious or down, and you lose your appetite.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and you seek out rest.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,840
All of this serves to save your energy and reroute it into your immune response.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
You become a country under attack switching into a war economy, because properly activating

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,980
your immune system is intensely disruptive and draining.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,300
Just like war is expensive for a country as industry switches to building tanks, your

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,380
immune system demands huge amounts of energy, amino acids, and micro-elements to build its

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,720
weapons.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,860
Take fever.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,360
It speeds up your metabolism and makes your cells work harder and faster while creating

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,260
heat that's pretty stressful for many invaders, but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain.

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,440
Then your immune system begins to clone millions of specialized immune cells to respond specifically

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,580
to the enemy infecting you.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,620
B cells produce millions of antibodies every second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,420
to construct.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,860
Billions or even trillions of proteins need to be made to refresh the complement system,

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,460
a minefield inside your blood.

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:46,340
Cytokines, the mobilization and information signals, also need constant refreshing.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,400
Usually you acquire your resources by eating, but when you're sick, your body slows down

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,340
your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can't spare.

44
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,500
So it reaches for the easiest source of amino acids and starts breaking down your muscles.

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,160
All that muscle that you worked so hard for is sacrificed to keep you alive.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,400
If you're young and healthy and fit, you'll make up for that quickly once you're better.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,260
But if you're old or very young, weak or suffer from chronic illness, this may be way too

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,580
Your body is literally consuming itself to keep the defense going.

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,700
If your whole system is already strained, when you get sick, just keeping your immune

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,900
responses going can overwhelm your capacities.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,820
Your immune system is a jerk, our enemies too.

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,900
Your immune system is as dangerous to you as it is to enemies.

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,000
There's a very fragile balance between the damage caused by an infection and the collateral

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,340
damage caused by immune cells.

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,300
One of your first responders are neutrophils.

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,380
Imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns.

57
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,560
If a neutrophil encounters enemies, it showers them with chemicals that cut them open, but

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,100
can also damage civilian cells, especially if the patient is already compromised, for

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,140
example by smoking.

60
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,300
On top of that, the microorganisms that invade you often release chemicals and toxins that

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,020
can cause significant damage and cell death.

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,380
So a serious infection often causes many tiny wounds, literally holes in your organs.

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,340
As you can imagine, it's not great to have holes and wounds in your organs, and your

64
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,540
body rushes to close them.

65
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,220
Your neutrophils and macrophages help by releasing chemicals that signal the body to start repairs,

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,900
and most of the damage is quickly filled up with regrowing cells.

67
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,460
But others are filled with collagen, a sort of fixal organic cement that gives your gooey

68
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,940
tissue structural integrity.

69
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,860
You've seen the result on your skin as scars.

70
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,380
A scar is different from the original tissue.

71
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,700
It has no functioning cells in it, it's like a sloppily applied cement patch.

72
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,660
It can't do what the original tissue was doing.

73
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,220
A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny bit weaker.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,540
A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen.

75
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,180
A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter.

76
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,220
And so as you go through life and survive serious disease after serious disease, the

77
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,100
functionality of your organs may decrease.

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,660
The damage is usually small enough not to affect your quality of life, but can be permanent.

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,300
Okay, this sounds depressing, but there is actually something you can do to avoid a lot

80
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,140
of this damage and train your immune system.

81
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,300
The best way to train your immune system.

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,660
Your immune system is unique.

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,780
Everyone has a slightly different immune system that's stronger against some enemies and weaker

84
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,340
against others, which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects our species from being

85
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,660
wiped out by a single infection.

86
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,980
Collectively, the immune system of the human species is a spectrum.

87
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,540
Most people respond well enough to an infection, a few are super responders, and a few don't

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,960
respond well and die.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,580
Some people survive the Black Death are more resistant to HIV or Coronavirus, or even resistant

90
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,300
against Ebola.

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,860
Others are killed easily by the flu, or are highly vulnerable to certain bacterial infections.

92
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,100
Where you are on this spectrum is impossible to predict.

93
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,220
And you also respond differently to every possible infection.

94
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,380
This is why seemingly very healthy young people died from COVID, while for some elderly people,

95
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,100
it was more like a mild flu.

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,760
The idea that you can weather all sorts of diseases if you never get a cold is wrong.

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,060
You never know what your immune system is good at until it's tested.

98
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,280
Getting sick is a gamble in life's casino with your health on the line, always.

99
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,780
But there is something you can do, hacking one of the best features of your immune system.

100
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,300
When you survive a disease, usually you have better defenses against it afterwards.

101
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,780
You gain memory cells that are very good at killing the specific enemy you fought that

102
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
day.

103
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,820
So you either don't get the disease again, or the next infection is much milder.

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,320
And you can use an incredible achievement of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism

105
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,060
to prevent damage from disease and train your immune system.

106
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,620
Vaccines.

107
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,820
Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease and train your defenses to be ready if it

108
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,580
ever shows up for real.

109
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,780
The goal is to create the same memory cells that you would get after surviving an infection.

110
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,360
But if you can feel some side effects, why should you still do it?

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,580
Nature versus vaccine dojo.

112
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,780
You have two options to train your immune system.

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,940
Vaccine dojo and nature dojo.

114
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,340
In vaccine dojo, you train with paper weapons and learn to defend yourself.

115
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,700
Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise.

116
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,100
Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for a few days, but that's generally it.

117
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,660
No scars, no permanent damage.

118
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,360
We discussed vaccine side effects in detail in another video if you want to learn more.

119
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,500
On the other hand, getting a disease to become immune means going to a nature dojo.

120
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,660
In nature dojo, you train with real weapons, sharp knives and saws.

121
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,700
Things might still work out, but with way more cuts and wounds.

122
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,900
But from time to time, someone will die, be it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza.

123
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,560
Nature dojo is just way more risky.

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,800
On top of that, the immunity you get from a vaccine is often better than the natural

125
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,080
resistance because they're engineered to engage your immune system in a more productive

126
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
way.

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,600
Of course, vaccines are not magic, and sometimes they don't protect us as well as we'd like

128
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,840
them to.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,540
Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly, like the Omicron coronavirus, or because your

130
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,760
specific immune system does not respond well to the vaccine and builds less of a defense.

131
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,800
Still, being vaccinated is one of the best tools to train your natural defenses.

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,900
In the end, if we look at the stunning progress humanity has made in the last century, eventually

133
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,620
we may overcome disease for good.

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,100
But until then, we can do our best to take care of ourselves and others.

135
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,940
Your body and your older self will be grateful to you.

136
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,540
Diseases are not the only problem humanity can address if we work together.

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,340
We believe the same is true for climate change, one of the main challenges of our generation.

138
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,420
We're very passionate about this topic, and we've covered it extensively in previous videos.

139
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,860
Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different levels of society, from governments and economies

140
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,780
down to the individual.

141
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,180
And there's one way you can take action now, by working with our friends from Wren, who

142
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,740
help you offset your carbon emissions.

143
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,860
By visiting Wren.co and answering a few questions, you can find out what your personal carbon

144
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,960
footprint is.

145
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Your first step should be reducing your footprint, but there are limits to that.

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,120
Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon footprint with a monthly subscription that

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,520
supports projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
the sky.

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,980
We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that can make a real difference in the climate

150
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
crisis.

151
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,320
Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution, you'll get pictures and updates from the

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,480
project you support, so you can directly see the impact you're making.

153
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,000
We appreciate Wren's focus on transparency and impact, so you can always retrace how

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
your money is spent.

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,920
One project we find especially interesting is refrigerant destruction.

156
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,260
Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant.

157
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,640
These gases, once released into the atmosphere, cause global warming thousands of times faster

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
than CO2.

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,440
Wren's project permanently destroys containers filled with these gases, proving with high

160
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,560
certainty that they'll never leak and contribute to global warming.

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,000
Sign up through Wren.co slash Kurzgesagt to start helping the planet.
