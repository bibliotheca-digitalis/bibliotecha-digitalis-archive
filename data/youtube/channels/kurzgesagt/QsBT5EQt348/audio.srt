1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Never before in history have there been so many people on Earth as right now.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our numbers have skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1800 to 2.3 billion in 1940,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
3.7 billion in 1970 and 7.4 billion in 2016.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The world population increased fourfold in the last century,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so what can we expect for the next century?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And what does population growth mean for our future?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Will there be mass migration,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
overcrowded slums in megacities covering continents,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
diseases and pollution,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
chaos and violence over energy,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
water and food,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and a human species focused only on sustaining itself?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Will population growth destroy our way of life,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In the 1960s, population growth reached an unprecedented rate,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
which led to apocalyptic prophecies.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The poor would procreate endlessly and overrun the developed world.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The legend of overpopulation was born.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
are not permanent features of some cultures or countries,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but rather part of a four-step process the whole world is going through,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the demographic transition.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Most developed countries have already made the transition,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
while other countries are doing it right now.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go back to the 18th century when the entire world, including Europe,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
was in the first stage of the demographic transition.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
By today's standards, Europe was worse off than a developing region,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets and poor medicine.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so the population hardly grew.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Women had between four and six children,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but only two of them would reach adulthood.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and brought the greatest change in human living conditions

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
since the agricultural revolution.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
People went from being peasants to workers.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Manufactured goods were mass-produced and became widely available.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication and medicine.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
but also raised standards of living and healthcare for the poor working population.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The second transition stage started.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine meant people stopped dying all the time,

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
especially so at a very young age.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The result was a population explosion, doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The main reason families used to have lots of children

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
was that only a few of them were likely to survive.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now that had changed, so the third stage of the transition was set in motion,

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
fewer babies were conceived and population growth slowed down.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Eventually a balance emerged.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Fewer people were dying and fewer children were born,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
so the death rate and birth rate became stable.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births and population growth came to an end.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
are having kids themselves now, leading to a noticeable spike in overall population.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The average today is 2.5, it was 5 40 years ago.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So as this generation gets older and fertility declines further,

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the rate of population growth will keep on slowing.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is true for every country.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In the West we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world,

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just look at Bangladesh.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In 1971 the average woman had seven kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of five.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In 2015 the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is the rule, not an exception.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're not special, we just had a head start.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than six children to less than three.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Others are catching up fast.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Bangladesh took just 20.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Iran managed it in 10 years.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and the more support they get, the faster they catch up.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop are so important.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No matter what your motivation is,

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
or you just want fewer refugees coming to your country,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the simple truth is that it's beneficial to you personally

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And we are getting there.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So the future of global population growth is actually not an apocalyptic prophecy at all.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a promise.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Population growth will come to an end.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And as the development level of the world rises,

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the number of people with a higher education will increase tenfold.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Countries who used to be in need will help advance development instead.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This video was a collaboration with Max Roser and Our World in Data,

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
where he explores the progress of humanity through research and data visualization.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Make sure to check it out.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In 2016, we were able to make more and better content than ever before

100
