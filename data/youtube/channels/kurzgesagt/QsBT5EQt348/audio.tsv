0	6000	Never before in history have there been so many people on Earth as right now.
6000	13000	Our numbers have skyrocketed from 1 billion in 1800 to 2.3 billion in 1940,
13000	20000	3.7 billion in 1970 and 7.4 billion in 2016.
20000	24000	The world population increased fourfold in the last century,
24000	27000	so what can we expect for the next century?
27000	31000	And what does population growth mean for our future?
31000	33000	Will there be mass migration,
33000	36000	overcrowded slums in megacities covering continents,
36000	38000	diseases and pollution,
38000	40000	chaos and violence over energy,
40000	42000	water and food,
42000	46000	and a human species focused only on sustaining itself?
46000	49000	Will population growth destroy our way of life,
49000	53000	or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic?
57000	67000	In the 1960s, population growth reached an unprecedented rate,
67000	70000	which led to apocalyptic prophecies.
70000	76000	The poor would procreate endlessly and overrun the developed world.
76000	79000	The legend of overpopulation was born.
79000	83000	But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion
83000	86000	are not permanent features of some cultures or countries,
86000	90000	but rather part of a four-step process the whole world is going through,
90000	92000	the demographic transition.
92000	95000	Most developed countries have already made the transition,
95000	98000	while other countries are doing it right now.
98000	102000	Let's go back to the 18th century when the entire world, including Europe,
102000	105000	was in the first stage of the demographic transition.
105000	109000	By today's standards, Europe was worse off than a developing region,
109000	114000	suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets and poor medicine.
114000	118000	A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast,
118000	120000	so the population hardly grew.
120000	123000	Women had between four and six children,
123000	126000	but only two of them would reach adulthood.
126000	129000	Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK
129000	132000	and brought the greatest change in human living conditions
132000	134000	since the agricultural revolution.
134000	138000	People went from being peasants to workers.
138000	142000	Manufactured goods were mass-produced and became widely available.
142000	148000	The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication and medicine.
148000	154000	The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation.
154000	158000	Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class,
158000	162000	but also raised standards of living and healthcare for the poor working population.
162000	165000	The second transition stage started.
165000	170000	Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine meant people stopped dying all the time,
170000	173000	especially so at a very young age.
173000	180000	The result was a population explosion, doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850.
180000	183000	The main reason families used to have lots of children
183000	186000	was that only a few of them were likely to survive.
186000	190000	Now that had changed, so the third stage of the transition was set in motion,
190000	195000	fewer babies were conceived and population growth slowed down.
195000	197000	Eventually a balance emerged.
197000	200000	Fewer people were dying and fewer children were born,
200000	203000	so the death rate and birth rate became stable.
203000	207000	Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition.
207000	213000	This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages.
213000	217000	First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions.
217000	222000	Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion.
222000	228000	Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births and population growth came to an end.
228000	233000	But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast?
233000	237000	Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s
237000	242000	are having kids themselves now, leading to a noticeable spike in overall population.
242000	245000	But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents.
245000	250000	The average today is 2.5, it was 5 40 years ago.
250000	255000	So as this generation gets older and fertility declines further,
255000	258000	the rate of population growth will keep on slowing.
258000	260000	This is true for every country.
260000	264000	In the West we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world,
264000	268000	but actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage.
268000	270000	Just look at Bangladesh.
270000	276000	In 1971 the average woman had seven kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of five.
276000	283000	In 2015 the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average.
283000	286000	This is the rule, not an exception.
286000	288000	We're not special, we just had a head start.
288000	295000	It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than six children to less than three.
295000	297000	Others are catching up fast.
297000	300000	Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years.
300000	302000	Bangladesh took just 20.
302000	305000	Iran managed it in 10 years.
305000	308000	All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch
308000	311000	and the more support they get, the faster they catch up.
311000	317000	This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop are so important.
317000	319000	No matter what your motivation is,
319000	322000	whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth
322000	325000	or you just want fewer refugees coming to your country,
325000	328000	the simple truth is that it's beneficial to you personally
328000	332000	if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life.
332000	334000	And we are getting there.
334000	340000	The percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today.
340000	345000	So the future of global population growth is actually not an apocalyptic prophecy at all.
345000	346000	It's a promise.
346000	349000	Population growth will come to an end.
349000	354000	The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all.
354000	357000	And as the development level of the world rises,
357000	362000	the number of people with a higher education will increase tenfold.
362000	367000	Countries who used to be in need will help advance development instead.
367000	372000	More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.
