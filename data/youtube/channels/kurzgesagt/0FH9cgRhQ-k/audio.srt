1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,040
planets or stars, they have no physical size limit and can literally grow

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,040
endlessly. Although in reality, specific things need to happen to create

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,560
different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,040
things in the universe. So how do black holes grow? And how large is the largest

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,480
of them all?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,840
This video will not discuss how black holes work or how they form, since we've

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,880
looked at that in detail in our black hole and neutron star series. You can

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,040
check them out afterwards. For now, we're interested in finding the largest thing

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:54,200
in the universe. Let's start really, really small. Primordial black holes. The

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,080
smallest kind of black holes may or may not exist. If they do, they're probably

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,240
the oldest objects in the universe, older even than atoms. They would have formed

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,520
just after the Big Bang, when the universe was so dense with violent energy

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,120
that any tiny pocket that was just slightly more dense than its neighbors

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,880
could produce a black hole. The smallest primordial black hole that could still

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,240
be around would be a trillion kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain. And yet

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,960
they would be no bigger than a proton. A primordial black hole with the mass of

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,240
Earth would barely be larger than a coin. This makes them very hard to find,

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,520
so we haven't actually observed any yet. If they exist, they may even be the

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,680
mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together. Let's move on to the

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,120
kinds of black holes that we know for sure are out there. Stellar black holes.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,960
To make a black hole, we need to compress enough matter so that it collapses into

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,800
itself. After that, the more mass we throw at it, the larger it becomes. In today's

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,620
universe, only the most violent cosmic events can create the necessary

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,720
conditions, such as the merger of neutron stars or when the core of a very massive

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,680
star collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to work with here, we'll use the

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,800
mass of our Sun, about 2 million trillion trillion kilograms. The smallest known

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,320
black hole has 2.7 times the mass of the Sun, which works out as a sphere

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,480
around 16 kilometers in diameter, large enough to cover Paris. Another

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,760
lightweight black hole is the companion to the V723 Mon red giant star. This star

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,080
is 24 times larger than our Sun, 30 million kilometers in diameter, and yet

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,320
it's thrown around by a tiny black hole just 17.2 kilometers wide. This tiny

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,600
thing bullying the star is so much smaller that we can barely even show

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,160
them in comparison. One of the largest known stellar black holes is M33 X7. It

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,040
currently spends its time eating a 70 solar mass blue giant bit by bit. As all

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,080
that stolen matter circles towards the black hole, like water going down a drain,

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
friction heats it up to temperatures high enough to shine 500,000 times

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,160
brighter than our Sun. And yet, X7 is only 15.65 solar masses and 92

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,160
kilometers wide, just big enough to cast a shadow on Corsica. To grow much larger,

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,640
black holes have to either devour a lot of stars, or better, merge with one

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,920
another. The instruments that make it possible to detect these mergers are

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,940
very new, so we're currently discovering a lot of exciting things, like two

43
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,600
massive black holes that we detected in a galaxy 17 billion light-years away. As

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,160
they spun around each other violently, they released more energy in the form of

45
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,120
gravitational waves than the combined light from all the stars in the Milky

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,640
Way in 4,400 years. The new black hole they formed is about the size of Germany

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:05,720
and is 142 solar masses. And here, we hit a curious gap in scale. There are lots of

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,080
black holes up to 150 solar masses, and then there's nothing for a long time,

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,840
until we suddenly hit black holes that are millions of times more massive, which

50
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,160
is a bit confusing, because we had this idea that black holes are consistently

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,040
growing and growing. But for the most massive black holes, this process is not

52
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,600
fast enough to explain their existence today. The universe is simply not old

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,240
enough for these supermassive black holes to have formed by eating stars and

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
merging with each other. Something else must have happened. To explain how we got

55
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,160
the largest black holes in the universe, we might need the largest stars that

56
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,520
ever existed, quasi-stars. To get a sense of scale, we can compare them to the

57
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,920
largest stars that exist today. Our Sun is like a grain of sand next to them. We

58
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,880
don't know if quasi-stars actually existed, but they're an interesting

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
concept when it comes to supercharging black hole development. The idea is that

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,640
the matter in the early universe was so dense that quasi-stars could grow to

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,300
thousands of times the mass of our Sun. The cause of these stars might have been

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,780
crushed by their own weight so much to actually collapse into black holes while

63
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,100
the star was still forming. In contrast to stars today that would destroy

64
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,220
themselves in the process, inside quasi-stars a deadly balance could

65
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,900
emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive star together, feeding the black hole and

66
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,980
heating the material falling in to such a degree that the radiation pressure kept

67
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,380
the star stable. And so these quickly growing black holes might have been able

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,780
to consume the quasi-star for millions of years and grow far bigger than any

69
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,740
modern stellar black hole. Black holes several thousand times the mass of the

70
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,900
Sun and wider than the entire Earth. These black holes might have become the

71
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,180
seeds for supermassive black holes. So now we arrive at the kings of our

72
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,900
universe, the largest single bodies in existence. The centers of most galaxies

73
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,540
contain a supermassive black hole and they are monstrous. In the Milky Way we

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,500
have Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole with about 4 million solar

75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
masses that is calm and collected and just does its thing. We know it sits

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,260
there because we can see a number of stars being thrown around by a seemingly

77
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,700
empty spot. And despite its incredible mass its radius is still only 17 times

78
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,140
our Sun. Smaller than most giant stars but millions of times more massive.

79
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,940
Because supermassive black holes are so massive and located at the center of

80
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,500
galaxies many people imagine them as being a bit like the Sun in the solar

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,020
system. An anchor that glues everything else together and forces it into an

82
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,820
orbit. But this is a misconception. While the Sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass

83
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,460
in the solar system supermassive black holes usually only have 0.001% of the

84
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,620
mass of their galaxy. The billions of stars in galaxies are not gravitationally

85
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,420
bound to them. Instead it's the gravitational effect of dark matter

86
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,300
which holds them together. Many supermassive black holes aren't gentle

87
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,180
giants especially when they're feeding on the clouds of mass in their galaxy.

88
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,660
The one at the center of the BL Lacerte galaxy is devouring so much

89
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,700
material that it produces jets of plasma accelerated to nearly the speed

90
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,700
of light. If Earth were orbiting this huge body it would seem 115 times larger

91
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,780
than our Sun in the sky and we'd be burnt to a crisp in seconds by its

92
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,220
glowing hot accretion disk. At this point black holes become so large that stars

93
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,260
seem ridiculously tiny compared to them. The galaxy Cygnus A has a supermassive

94
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,740
black hole with 2.5 billion solar masses and 14.7 billion kilometers wide which

95
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,420
would mean that if it took the place of our Sun it would swallow all the planets

96
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,820
and stretch halfway to the edge of our solar system. It's devouring so much mass

97
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,180
and material that it turns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel spewing gas

98
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,940
out making tremendous radio lobes towering over the galaxy half a million

99
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,540
light years in diameter. That's two and a half milky ways wide. Another pretty

100
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,500
large supermassive black hole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It has 6.5

101
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,060
billion solar masses and was the first black hole we got an actual photo of or

102
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:40,620
rather of the glowing gas around the edge of a menacing shadow. This sphere of

103
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,880
darkness is so large that it covers our entire solar system and yet there is a

104
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:56,400
scale even above these kinds of objects. Ultramassive black holes. Now we reach

105
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,520
the most massive black holes perhaps the largest single bodies that will ever

106
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,360
exist. These black holes have eaten so much that they've grown to tens of

107
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,120
billions of solar masses their gravity the engine for a quasar an accretion

108
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,200
disk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies full of stars. So massive that

109
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,940
they deserve a title of their own. Ultramassive black holes. The

110
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,920
ultramassive black hole at the center of galaxy oj 287 is 18 billion solar

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,160
masses. It's so big that it has a supermassive black hole nearly 40 times

112
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,920
larger than Sagittarius a star orbiting it. This thing defies imagination and is

113
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,760
really hard to compare to anything. It can comfortably fit three solar systems

114
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,080
side-by-side inside of it. Let's end this insane competition and get to the king

115
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,800
of kings. Ton 618 a black hole that we can observe consuming galaxies worth of

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,600
matter is shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion stars visible from

117
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,880
18 billion light-years away. It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses. A

118
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,160
black hole so large that it would take light a week to reach the singularity

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,360
after crossing the event horizon. About 11 solar systems could sit inside of it

120
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,120
side-by-side. It may very well be the largest single body in the universe but

121
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,520
in reality it's probably even larger. Since ton 618 is so far away we only see

122
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,480
what it looked like 10 billion years ago. In any case black holes are scary and

123
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,960
mysterious and gigantic. They'll be here after everything else dies and growing

124
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,680
larger and larger. Okay now let's do the trip again from the smallest possible

125
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,080
black hole all the way up to the largest.

126
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:30,360
let's try something new today we can call it behind the lies a short

127
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,080
behind-the-scenes bit about the necessary inaccuracies in this video

128
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,040
because it's not really actually possible to rank black holes like

129
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,880
trading cards how so well while we've catalogued millions of stars we really

130
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,400
only have good data on a couple of dozen black holes that's because black hole

131
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,400
gazing wasn't really a thing until 50 years ago and technically still isn't

132
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,240
because we can't see black holes we can only derive their properties from

133
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,760
studying their gravitational effects on the matter around them like the orbit of

134
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,960
stars that come close to them this effect depends on the mass of the black

135
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,520
hole which we can approximate at the most basic level with Kepler's laws but

136
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,480
this comes with huge uncertainties and error bars then we have to convert mass

137
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,040
to size next which brings new uncertainties for example we calculated

138
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,220
the radius from the mass using the Schwarzschild equation which for the

139
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,080
sake of simplicity assumes black holes are perfectly round and don't spin the

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,520
kind of black hole that doesn't really exist the reality is that physics on

141
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,360
these scales is a bit fuzzy so some of the black holes we talked about here

142
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,200
may be way smaller or way bigger we just don't know for sure we shim it around

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,080
this problem by comparing different sources with different kinds of values

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,440
and using different mass calculations to arrive at a standardized list that

145
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,400
allowed us to be as accurate as humanly possible you can look at all of this in

146
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,040
our source doc as a result this script was written with the tears of experts we

147
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,040
drove crazy with our obsession for the best values they could live with in this

148
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,840
process tons of stuff got cut and didn't make it into the final video but luckily

149
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,040
we found a way to not waste all of it we've created a lot of black hole merch

150
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,960
spanning the whole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious this way we get

151
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,000
to explore a topic from different angles and you get to continue having fun with

152
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,560
black holes after this video ends
