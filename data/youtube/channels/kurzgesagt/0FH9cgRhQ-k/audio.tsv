0	5440	The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like
5440	10040	planets or stars, they have no physical size limit and can literally grow
10040	14040	endlessly. Although in reality, specific things need to happen to create
14040	18560	different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single
18560	25040	things in the universe. So how do black holes grow? And how large is the largest
25040	27480	of them all?
30000	38840	This video will not discuss how black holes work or how they form, since we've
38840	42880	looked at that in detail in our black hole and neutron star series. You can
42880	47040	check them out afterwards. For now, we're interested in finding the largest thing
47040	54200	in the universe. Let's start really, really small. Primordial black holes. The
54200	59080	smallest kind of black holes may or may not exist. If they do, they're probably
59120	64240	the oldest objects in the universe, older even than atoms. They would have formed
64240	68520	just after the Big Bang, when the universe was so dense with violent energy
68520	72120	that any tiny pocket that was just slightly more dense than its neighbors
72120	76880	could produce a black hole. The smallest primordial black hole that could still
76880	82240	be around would be a trillion kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain. And yet
82240	86960	they would be no bigger than a proton. A primordial black hole with the mass of
86960	91240	Earth would barely be larger than a coin. This makes them very hard to find,
91240	96520	so we haven't actually observed any yet. If they exist, they may even be the
96520	101680	mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together. Let's move on to the
101680	108120	kinds of black holes that we know for sure are out there. Stellar black holes.
108120	112960	To make a black hole, we need to compress enough matter so that it collapses into
113080	118800	itself. After that, the more mass we throw at it, the larger it becomes. In today's
118800	122620	universe, only the most violent cosmic events can create the necessary
122620	126720	conditions, such as the merger of neutron stars or when the core of a very massive
126720	131680	star collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to work with here, we'll use the
131680	137800	mass of our Sun, about 2 million trillion trillion kilograms. The smallest known
137800	142320	black hole has 2.7 times the mass of the Sun, which works out as a sphere
142320	147480	around 16 kilometers in diameter, large enough to cover Paris. Another
147480	153760	lightweight black hole is the companion to the V723 Mon red giant star. This star
153760	159080	is 24 times larger than our Sun, 30 million kilometers in diameter, and yet
159080	165320	it's thrown around by a tiny black hole just 17.2 kilometers wide. This tiny
165320	169600	thing bullying the star is so much smaller that we can barely even show
169600	176160	them in comparison. One of the largest known stellar black holes is M33 X7. It
176160	182040	currently spends its time eating a 70 solar mass blue giant bit by bit. As all
182040	186080	that stolen matter circles towards the black hole, like water going down a drain,
186080	190480	friction heats it up to temperatures high enough to shine 500,000 times
190480	198160	brighter than our Sun. And yet, X7 is only 15.65 solar masses and 92
198160	204160	kilometers wide, just big enough to cast a shadow on Corsica. To grow much larger,
204160	208640	black holes have to either devour a lot of stars, or better, merge with one
208640	212920	another. The instruments that make it possible to detect these mergers are
212920	217940	very new, so we're currently discovering a lot of exciting things, like two
217940	222600	massive black holes that we detected in a galaxy 17 billion light-years away. As
222600	227160	they spun around each other violently, they released more energy in the form of
227160	231120	gravitational waves than the combined light from all the stars in the Milky
231120	237640	Way in 4,400 years. The new black hole they formed is about the size of Germany
237640	245720	and is 142 solar masses. And here, we hit a curious gap in scale. There are lots of
245720	251080	black holes up to 150 solar masses, and then there's nothing for a long time,
251080	256840	until we suddenly hit black holes that are millions of times more massive, which
256840	261160	is a bit confusing, because we had this idea that black holes are consistently
261160	266040	growing and growing. But for the most massive black holes, this process is not
266040	270600	fast enough to explain their existence today. The universe is simply not old
270600	274240	enough for these supermassive black holes to have formed by eating stars and
274240	278960	merging with each other. Something else must have happened. To explain how we got
278960	283160	the largest black holes in the universe, we might need the largest stars that
283160	288520	ever existed, quasi-stars. To get a sense of scale, we can compare them to the
288520	294920	largest stars that exist today. Our Sun is like a grain of sand next to them. We
294920	298880	don't know if quasi-stars actually existed, but they're an interesting
298880	303440	concept when it comes to supercharging black hole development. The idea is that
303440	307640	the matter in the early universe was so dense that quasi-stars could grow to
307640	312300	thousands of times the mass of our Sun. The cause of these stars might have been
312300	316780	crushed by their own weight so much to actually collapse into black holes while
316780	321100	the star was still forming. In contrast to stars today that would destroy
321100	325220	themselves in the process, inside quasi-stars a deadly balance could
325220	329900	emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive star together, feeding the black hole and
329900	333980	heating the material falling in to such a degree that the radiation pressure kept
333980	338380	the star stable. And so these quickly growing black holes might have been able
338460	342780	to consume the quasi-star for millions of years and grow far bigger than any
342780	347740	modern stellar black hole. Black holes several thousand times the mass of the
347740	352900	Sun and wider than the entire Earth. These black holes might have become the
352900	359180	seeds for supermassive black holes. So now we arrive at the kings of our
359180	364900	universe, the largest single bodies in existence. The centers of most galaxies
364900	370540	contain a supermassive black hole and they are monstrous. In the Milky Way we
370540	375500	have Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole with about 4 million solar
375500	380500	masses that is calm and collected and just does its thing. We know it sits
380500	384260	there because we can see a number of stars being thrown around by a seemingly
384260	390700	empty spot. And despite its incredible mass its radius is still only 17 times
390780	397140	our Sun. Smaller than most giant stars but millions of times more massive.
397140	401940	Because supermassive black holes are so massive and located at the center of
401940	405500	galaxies many people imagine them as being a bit like the Sun in the solar
405500	410020	system. An anchor that glues everything else together and forces it into an
410020	416820	orbit. But this is a misconception. While the Sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass
416820	423460	in the solar system supermassive black holes usually only have 0.001% of the
423460	428620	mass of their galaxy. The billions of stars in galaxies are not gravitationally
428620	432420	bound to them. Instead it's the gravitational effect of dark matter
432420	437300	which holds them together. Many supermassive black holes aren't gentle
437300	441180	giants especially when they're feeding on the clouds of mass in their galaxy.
441180	445660	The one at the center of the BL Lacerte galaxy is devouring so much
445660	449700	material that it produces jets of plasma accelerated to nearly the speed
449700	455700	of light. If Earth were orbiting this huge body it would seem 115 times larger
455700	459780	than our Sun in the sky and we'd be burnt to a crisp in seconds by its
459780	465220	glowing hot accretion disk. At this point black holes become so large that stars
465220	471260	seem ridiculously tiny compared to them. The galaxy Cygnus A has a supermassive
471420	477740	black hole with 2.5 billion solar masses and 14.7 billion kilometers wide which
477740	481420	would mean that if it took the place of our Sun it would swallow all the planets
481420	486820	and stretch halfway to the edge of our solar system. It's devouring so much mass
486820	492180	and material that it turns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel spewing gas
492180	496940	out making tremendous radio lobes towering over the galaxy half a million
496940	503540	light years in diameter. That's two and a half milky ways wide. Another pretty
503540	509500	large supermassive black hole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It has 6.5
509500	514060	billion solar masses and was the first black hole we got an actual photo of or
514060	520620	rather of the glowing gas around the edge of a menacing shadow. This sphere of
520620	526880	darkness is so large that it covers our entire solar system and yet there is a
526880	536400	scale even above these kinds of objects. Ultramassive black holes. Now we reach
536400	540520	the most massive black holes perhaps the largest single bodies that will ever
540520	545360	exist. These black holes have eaten so much that they've grown to tens of
545360	550120	billions of solar masses their gravity the engine for a quasar an accretion
550120	555200	disk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies full of stars. So massive that
555200	559940	they deserve a title of their own. Ultramassive black holes. The
559940	565920	ultramassive black hole at the center of galaxy oj 287 is 18 billion solar
565920	571160	masses. It's so big that it has a supermassive black hole nearly 40 times
571160	576920	larger than Sagittarius a star orbiting it. This thing defies imagination and is
576920	581760	really hard to compare to anything. It can comfortably fit three solar systems
581800	588080	side-by-side inside of it. Let's end this insane competition and get to the king
588080	593800	of kings. Ton 618 a black hole that we can observe consuming galaxies worth of
593800	598600	matter is shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion stars visible from
598600	604880	18 billion light-years away. It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses. A
604880	609160	black hole so large that it would take light a week to reach the singularity
609400	614360	after crossing the event horizon. About 11 solar systems could sit inside of it
614360	620120	side-by-side. It may very well be the largest single body in the universe but
620120	626520	in reality it's probably even larger. Since ton 618 is so far away we only see
626520	632480	what it looked like 10 billion years ago. In any case black holes are scary and
632480	638960	mysterious and gigantic. They'll be here after everything else dies and growing
638960	645680	larger and larger. Okay now let's do the trip again from the smallest possible
645680	650080	black hole all the way up to the largest.
668960	690360	let's try something new today we can call it behind the lies a short
690360	694080	behind-the-scenes bit about the necessary inaccuracies in this video
694080	698040	because it's not really actually possible to rank black holes like
698040	703880	trading cards how so well while we've catalogued millions of stars we really
703880	708400	only have good data on a couple of dozen black holes that's because black hole
708400	712400	gazing wasn't really a thing until 50 years ago and technically still isn't
712400	716240	because we can't see black holes we can only derive their properties from
716240	719760	studying their gravitational effects on the matter around them like the orbit of
719760	723960	stars that come close to them this effect depends on the mass of the black
723960	728520	hole which we can approximate at the most basic level with Kepler's laws but
728520	733480	this comes with huge uncertainties and error bars then we have to convert mass
733480	738040	to size next which brings new uncertainties for example we calculated
738040	741220	the radius from the mass using the Schwarzschild equation which for the
741220	746080	sake of simplicity assumes black holes are perfectly round and don't spin the
746080	750520	kind of black hole that doesn't really exist the reality is that physics on
750520	755360	these scales is a bit fuzzy so some of the black holes we talked about here
755360	760200	may be way smaller or way bigger we just don't know for sure we shim it around
760200	764080	this problem by comparing different sources with different kinds of values
764080	768440	and using different mass calculations to arrive at a standardized list that
768440	772400	allowed us to be as accurate as humanly possible you can look at all of this in
772400	777040	our source doc as a result this script was written with the tears of experts we
777040	782040	drove crazy with our obsession for the best values they could live with in this
782040	786840	process tons of stuff got cut and didn't make it into the final video but luckily
786840	792040	we found a way to not waste all of it we've created a lot of black hole merch
792040	796960	spanning the whole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious this way we get
796960	801000	to explore a topic from different angles and you get to continue having fun with
801000	803560	black holes after this video ends
