1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Mechanisms of evolution. What is evolution? Evolution is the development of life on Earth.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,080
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,840
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,600
It shows us how primitive protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a dachshund

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,080
and a Great Dane together. How is it possible for ancestors to have descendants that look so

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,040
very different to them? In answering this question, we want to focus on animals,

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,160
excluding other forms of life such as fungi and plants. The first question to ask is therefore,

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,760
how can one animal develop into a whole new species of animal? Ah, but just a quick question.

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:16,520
What exactly is a species? A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,960
with one another, with those offspring also being capable of reproducing in turn. To understand this

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,920
answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points. The uniqueness of living

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,200
creatures, guaranteed through the excess production of offspring and heredity, and as a second key

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:44,760
point, selection. Let's begin with uniqueness. Every creature that exists is unique and this

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,240
is essential for evolution. The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,480
appearance. However, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics. They may

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,760
be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger, or bolder than their fellow animals. So what is the reason for

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,720
these differences? Let's take a closer look at a creature. Every creature is made up of cells.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,960
These cells have a nucleus. The nucleus contains the chromosomes and the chromosomes hold the DNA.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,240
DNA consists of different genes and it's these genes that are life's information carriers. They

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,040
contain instructions and orders for the cells and determine the characteristics and traits that

22
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:42,440
living creatures have and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature. It's slightly

23
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,280
different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:58,360
But how is the enormous range of DNA created? One key factor is the excess production of

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,720
offspring. In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,200
than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying an early

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,360
death as a result. Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,240
live is able to support. This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species.

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,880
The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,640
And this is what nature wants, as many little differences as possible.

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,280
The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,360
By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring.

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Two very interesting factors come into play in this process. Recombination and mutation.

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,440
Recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures.

35
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,440
When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice.

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,640
The first time they do this separately, when they generate the gametes, that is, sperm and egg cells.

37
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,440
The gametes take half of the genes and shuffle them.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,200
The second recombination occurs when a male inseminates a female.

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,120
The parents each provide 50% of their DNA. In other words,

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,920
50% of their unique traits and characteristics.

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
These are then recombined or mixed, and the result is new offspring.

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,360
These offspring have a random mix of the DNA and therefore the traits and characteristics

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,760
of their parents. This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further.

44
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,960
But mutations are also important for evolution. Mutations are random changes in DNA.

45
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,400
These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA,

46
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,200
triggered by toxins or other chemical substances, or by radiation.

47
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,320
A mutation exists when a part of the DNA is altered.

48
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,000
These changes are often negative and may result in illnesses such as cancer.

49
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,280
However, they may also have neutral or positive effects,

50
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,360
such as the blue eye color in humans, which is one such random mutation.

51
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,160
In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamete, that is a sperm or egg cell,

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,120
because only the DNA in the gametes is passed on to the offspring.

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,040
This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays,

54
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
whilst other parts of the body are not at risk.

55
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,280
In summary then, in the heredity process,

56
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,960
creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA.

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,800
Recombination and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings

58
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,480
and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents.

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,840
There's a key word here, random. All of these processes are based on chance.

60
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,680
Random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of traits

61
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,760
and characteristics, which in turn mix these randomly and pass them on.

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,760
But how can so much be down to chance when all living creatures are so perfectly adapted to

63
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,720
their environment? For example, the stick insect, the hummingbird, and the frogfish.

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,400
The answer is provided by the second key point, selection.

65
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection.

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,720
As we have learned, each individual is somewhat different to its fellows,

67
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,640
and there is extensive variation within a species.

68
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,720
Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures.

69
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,080
These so-called selection factors include predators, parasites, animals of the same species,

70
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,120
toxins, changes in habitat, or the climate.

71
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,360
Selection is a process that each individual is subjected to.

72
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,760
Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics.

73
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,200
This mix helps them to survive in their environment, or not, as the case may be.

74
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,840
Anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment.

75
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,800
Those with the right mix survive and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics.

76
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:53,000
This is why diversity is so important. This is why creatures make so much effort to produce

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,200
offspring that are as different as possible. They increase the likelihood that at least one

78
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,040
of their offspring passes nature's selection process. They maximize their chances of survival.

79
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,280
A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote island.

80
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,760
They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science and are known as Darwin finches,

81
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,920
after their discoverer, Charles Darwin. And this is the story of those finches.

82
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,160
A few hundred years ago, a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos Islands

83
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,800
in the middle of the Pacific, probably by a big storm.

84
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
The finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to them,

85
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,080
a real finch paradise, an abundance of food, and no predators.

86
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,880
They reproduced rapidly and numerously. The islands were soon heaving with finches.

87
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,520
This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce.

88
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,480
The finch paradise was threatened with famine, and finch friends became competitors.

89
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,640
This is when selection intervened. Their individuality and small differences,

90
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,400
in this case their slightly different beaks, meant that some of the birds were able to

91
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,080
avoid competing with their fellow finches. The beaks of some of the finches were more

92
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,200
suitable for digging for worms. Other finches were able to use their

93
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,040
beaks better for cracking seeds. The finches consequently sought out ecological niches.

94
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,400
In these niches, they were safe from excessive competition.

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,880
They soon began to mate primarily with other finches that used the same niche.

96
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,520
Over the course of many generations, these characteristics were enhanced,

97
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,640
enabling the finches to exploit their niches successfully.

98
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,240
The differences between the worm diggers and the seed crackers became so large that they

99
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,040
were no longer able to mate with one another. Different species emerged as a result.

100
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,160
Today, there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos Islands,

101
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,520
all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches.

102
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,640
This is how new species are created by evolution. Through the interaction of unique individuals,

103
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,960
the excess production of offspring, recombination and mutation in heredity,

104
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,040
and finally, through selection. Why is this so important?

105
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,800
It tells us where the variety of life comes from and why living creatures are so perfectly adapted

106
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,280
to their habitats. But it also affects us personally. Every person is the result of

107
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,440
three and a half billion years of evolution. And that includes you. Your ancestors fought

108
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,040
and adapted in order to survive. This survival was an extremely uncertain thing.

109
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,200
If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct,

110
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,840
then you can consider yourself part of a success story.

111
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:59,640
The dinosaurs have disappeared, but you are alive, watching this video.

112
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,400
Because you're incredibly special, just like all the other creatures that exist today.

113
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:19,400
Irreproducible and unique in the universe.

114
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:47,560
Thanks for watching!
