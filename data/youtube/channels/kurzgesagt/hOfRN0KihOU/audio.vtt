00:00.000 --> 00:12.480
Mechanisms of evolution. What is evolution? Evolution is the development of life on Earth.

00:12.480 --> 00:19.080
This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.840
Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.600
It shows us how primitive protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.

00:30.600 --> 00:39.600
Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a dachshund

00:39.600 --> 00:47.080
and a Great Dane together. How is it possible for ancestors to have descendants that look so

00:47.080 --> 00:53.040
very different to them? In answering this question, we want to focus on animals,

00:53.040 --> 01:00.160
excluding other forms of life such as fungi and plants. The first question to ask is therefore,

01:00.160 --> 01:06.760
how can one animal develop into a whole new species of animal? Ah, but just a quick question.

01:06.760 --> 01:16.520
What exactly is a species? A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring

01:16.520 --> 01:22.960
with one another, with those offspring also being capable of reproducing in turn. To understand this

01:22.960 --> 01:28.920
answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points. The uniqueness of living

01:28.920 --> 01:35.200
creatures, guaranteed through the excess production of offspring and heredity, and as a second key

01:35.200 --> 01:44.760
point, selection. Let's begin with uniqueness. Every creature that exists is unique and this

01:44.760 --> 01:50.240
is essential for evolution. The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in

01:50.240 --> 01:56.480
appearance. However, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics. They may

01:56.480 --> 02:03.760
be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger, or bolder than their fellow animals. So what is the reason for

02:03.760 --> 02:10.720
these differences? Let's take a closer look at a creature. Every creature is made up of cells.

02:10.720 --> 02:19.960
These cells have a nucleus. The nucleus contains the chromosomes and the chromosomes hold the DNA.

02:20.640 --> 02:29.240
DNA consists of different genes and it's these genes that are life's information carriers. They

02:29.240 --> 02:34.040
contain instructions and orders for the cells and determine the characteristics and traits that

02:34.040 --> 02:42.440
living creatures have and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature. It's slightly

02:42.440 --> 02:48.280
different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics.

02:48.280 --> 02:58.360
But how is the enormous range of DNA created? One key factor is the excess production of

02:58.360 --> 03:03.720
offspring. In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring

03:03.720 --> 03:08.200
than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying an early

03:08.200 --> 03:12.360
death as a result. Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they

03:12.360 --> 03:17.240
live is able to support. This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.880
The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.640
And this is what nature wants, as many little differences as possible.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.280
The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.360
By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring.

03:42.520 --> 03:49.000
Two very interesting factors come into play in this process. Recombination and mutation.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.440
Recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.440
When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.640
The first time they do this separately, when they generate the gametes, that is, sperm and egg cells.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.440
The gametes take half of the genes and shuffle them.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.200
The second recombination occurs when a male inseminates a female.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.120
The parents each provide 50% of their DNA. In other words,

04:24.120 --> 04:26.920
50% of their unique traits and characteristics.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.600
These are then recombined or mixed, and the result is new offspring.

04:33.400 --> 04:38.360
These offspring have a random mix of the DNA and therefore the traits and characteristics

04:38.360 --> 04:44.760
of their parents. This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further.

04:47.560 --> 04:53.960
But mutations are also important for evolution. Mutations are random changes in DNA.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.400
These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA,

05:00.280 --> 05:04.200
triggered by toxins or other chemical substances, or by radiation.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.320
A mutation exists when a part of the DNA is altered.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.000
These changes are often negative and may result in illnesses such as cancer.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.280
However, they may also have neutral or positive effects,

05:20.280 --> 05:24.360
such as the blue eye color in humans, which is one such random mutation.

05:24.360 --> 05:31.160
In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamete, that is a sperm or egg cell,

05:32.600 --> 05:36.120
because only the DNA in the gametes is passed on to the offspring.

05:37.800 --> 05:42.040
This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays,

05:42.040 --> 05:44.280
whilst other parts of the body are not at risk.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.280
In summary then, in the heredity process,

05:48.280 --> 05:51.960
creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA.

05:51.960 --> 05:59.800
Recombination and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings

05:59.800 --> 06:03.480
and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents.

06:06.360 --> 06:12.840
There's a key word here, random. All of these processes are based on chance.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.680
Random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of traits

06:18.680 --> 06:22.760
and characteristics, which in turn mix these randomly and pass them on.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.760
But how can so much be down to chance when all living creatures are so perfectly adapted to

06:30.760 --> 06:37.720
their environment? For example, the stick insect, the hummingbird, and the frogfish.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.400
The answer is provided by the second key point, selection.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.960
Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection.

06:48.680 --> 06:53.720
As we have learned, each individual is somewhat different to its fellows,

06:54.840 --> 06:57.640
and there is extensive variation within a species.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.720
Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures.

07:03.720 --> 07:11.080
These so-called selection factors include predators, parasites, animals of the same species,

07:11.080 --> 07:14.120
toxins, changes in habitat, or the climate.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.360
Selection is a process that each individual is subjected to.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.760
Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics.

07:24.680 --> 07:30.200
This mix helps them to survive in their environment, or not, as the case may be.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.840
Anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.800
Those with the right mix survive and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics.

07:44.280 --> 07:53.000
This is why diversity is so important. This is why creatures make so much effort to produce

07:53.000 --> 07:58.200
offspring that are as different as possible. They increase the likelihood that at least one

07:58.200 --> 08:04.040
of their offspring passes nature's selection process. They maximize their chances of survival.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.280
A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote island.

08:10.280 --> 08:16.760
They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science and are known as Darwin finches,

08:16.760 --> 08:22.920
after their discoverer, Charles Darwin. And this is the story of those finches.

08:22.920 --> 08:27.160
A few hundred years ago, a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos Islands

08:27.160 --> 08:29.800
in the middle of the Pacific, probably by a big storm.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.760
The finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to them,

08:36.840 --> 08:41.080
a real finch paradise, an abundance of food, and no predators.

08:42.600 --> 08:47.880
They reproduced rapidly and numerously. The islands were soon heaving with finches.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.520
This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.480
The finch paradise was threatened with famine, and finch friends became competitors.

08:56.680 --> 09:01.640
This is when selection intervened. Their individuality and small differences,

09:01.640 --> 09:05.400
in this case their slightly different beaks, meant that some of the birds were able to

09:05.400 --> 09:13.080
avoid competing with their fellow finches. The beaks of some of the finches were more

09:13.080 --> 09:18.200
suitable for digging for worms. Other finches were able to use their

09:18.200 --> 09:24.040
beaks better for cracking seeds. The finches consequently sought out ecological niches.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.400
In these niches, they were safe from excessive competition.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.880
They soon began to mate primarily with other finches that used the same niche.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.520
Over the course of many generations, these characteristics were enhanced,

09:36.520 --> 09:39.640
enabling the finches to exploit their niches successfully.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.240
The differences between the worm diggers and the seed crackers became so large that they

09:45.240 --> 09:50.040
were no longer able to mate with one another. Different species emerged as a result.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.160
Today, there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos Islands,

09:57.160 --> 10:00.520
all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches.

10:01.320 --> 10:07.640
This is how new species are created by evolution. Through the interaction of unique individuals,

10:07.640 --> 10:13.960
the excess production of offspring, recombination and mutation in heredity,

10:13.960 --> 10:20.040
and finally, through selection. Why is this so important?

10:20.040 --> 10:25.800
It tells us where the variety of life comes from and why living creatures are so perfectly adapted

10:25.800 --> 10:32.280
to their habitats. But it also affects us personally. Every person is the result of

10:32.280 --> 10:38.440
three and a half billion years of evolution. And that includes you. Your ancestors fought

10:38.440 --> 10:44.040
and adapted in order to survive. This survival was an extremely uncertain thing.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.200
If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.840
then you can consider yourself part of a success story.

10:52.840 --> 10:59.640
The dinosaurs have disappeared, but you are alive, watching this video.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.400
Because you're incredibly special, just like all the other creatures that exist today.

11:06.200 --> 11:19.400
Irreproducible and unique in the universe.

11:22.840 --> 11:47.560
Thanks for watching!
