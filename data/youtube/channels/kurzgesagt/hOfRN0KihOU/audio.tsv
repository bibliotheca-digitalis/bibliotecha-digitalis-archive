0	12480	Mechanisms of evolution. What is evolution? Evolution is the development of life on Earth.
12480	19080	This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day.
19080	24840	Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop.
24840	30600	It shows us how primitive protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today.
30600	39600	Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a dachshund
39600	47080	and a Great Dane together. How is it possible for ancestors to have descendants that look so
47080	53040	very different to them? In answering this question, we want to focus on animals,
53040	60160	excluding other forms of life such as fungi and plants. The first question to ask is therefore,
60160	66760	how can one animal develop into a whole new species of animal? Ah, but just a quick question.
66760	76520	What exactly is a species? A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring
76520	82960	with one another, with those offspring also being capable of reproducing in turn. To understand this
82960	88920	answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points. The uniqueness of living
88920	95200	creatures, guaranteed through the excess production of offspring and heredity, and as a second key
95200	104760	point, selection. Let's begin with uniqueness. Every creature that exists is unique and this
104760	110240	is essential for evolution. The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in
110240	116480	appearance. However, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics. They may
116480	123760	be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger, or bolder than their fellow animals. So what is the reason for
123760	130720	these differences? Let's take a closer look at a creature. Every creature is made up of cells.
130720	139960	These cells have a nucleus. The nucleus contains the chromosomes and the chromosomes hold the DNA.
140640	149240	DNA consists of different genes and it's these genes that are life's information carriers. They
149240	154040	contain instructions and orders for the cells and determine the characteristics and traits that
154040	162440	living creatures have and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature. It's slightly
162440	168280	different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics.
168280	178360	But how is the enormous range of DNA created? One key factor is the excess production of
178360	183720	offspring. In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring
183720	188200	than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying an early
188200	192360	death as a result. Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they
192360	197240	live is able to support. This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species.
198040	201880	The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur.
203000	207640	And this is what nature wants, as many little differences as possible.
210040	214280	The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself.
216360	220360	By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring.
222520	229000	Two very interesting factors come into play in this process. Recombination and mutation.
231080	234440	Recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures.
236040	240440	When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice.
242040	247640	The first time they do this separately, when they generate the gametes, that is, sperm and egg cells.
247640	252440	The gametes take half of the genes and shuffle them.
254520	258200	The second recombination occurs when a male inseminates a female.
260280	264120	The parents each provide 50% of their DNA. In other words,
264120	266920	50% of their unique traits and characteristics.
268600	272600	These are then recombined or mixed, and the result is new offspring.
273400	278360	These offspring have a random mix of the DNA and therefore the traits and characteristics
278360	284760	of their parents. This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further.
287560	293960	But mutations are also important for evolution. Mutations are random changes in DNA.
295320	299400	These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA,
300280	304200	triggered by toxins or other chemical substances, or by radiation.
306040	309320	A mutation exists when a part of the DNA is altered.
310840	315000	These changes are often negative and may result in illnesses such as cancer.
316920	320280	However, they may also have neutral or positive effects,
320280	324360	such as the blue eye color in humans, which is one such random mutation.
324360	331160	In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamete, that is a sperm or egg cell,
332600	336120	because only the DNA in the gametes is passed on to the offspring.
337800	342040	This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays,
342040	344280	whilst other parts of the body are not at risk.
345320	348280	In summary then, in the heredity process,
348280	351960	creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA.
351960	359800	Recombination and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings
359800	363480	and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents.
366360	372840	There's a key word here, random. All of these processes are based on chance.
373720	378680	Random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of traits
378680	382760	and characteristics, which in turn mix these randomly and pass them on.
385800	390760	But how can so much be down to chance when all living creatures are so perfectly adapted to
390760	397720	their environment? For example, the stick insect, the hummingbird, and the frogfish.
400120	403400	The answer is provided by the second key point, selection.
404520	407960	Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection.
408680	413720	As we have learned, each individual is somewhat different to its fellows,
414840	417640	and there is extensive variation within a species.
420360	423720	Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures.
423720	431080	These so-called selection factors include predators, parasites, animals of the same species,
431080	434120	toxins, changes in habitat, or the climate.
434120	438360	Selection is a process that each individual is subjected to.
439640	442760	Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics.
444680	450200	This mix helps them to survive in their environment, or not, as the case may be.
451560	454840	Anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment.
459160	463800	Those with the right mix survive and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics.
464280	473000	This is why diversity is so important. This is why creatures make so much effort to produce
473000	478200	offspring that are as different as possible. They increase the likelihood that at least one
478200	484040	of their offspring passes nature's selection process. They maximize their chances of survival.
486120	490280	A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote island.
490280	496760	They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science and are known as Darwin finches,
496760	502920	after their discoverer, Charles Darwin. And this is the story of those finches.
502920	507160	A few hundred years ago, a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos Islands
507160	509800	in the middle of the Pacific, probably by a big storm.
512760	516760	The finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to them,
516840	521080	a real finch paradise, an abundance of food, and no predators.
522600	527880	They reproduced rapidly and numerously. The islands were soon heaving with finches.
527880	530520	This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce.
531080	535480	The finch paradise was threatened with famine, and finch friends became competitors.
536680	541640	This is when selection intervened. Their individuality and small differences,
541640	545400	in this case their slightly different beaks, meant that some of the birds were able to
545400	553080	avoid competing with their fellow finches. The beaks of some of the finches were more
553080	558200	suitable for digging for worms. Other finches were able to use their
558200	564040	beaks better for cracking seeds. The finches consequently sought out ecological niches.
564600	567400	In these niches, they were safe from excessive competition.
568200	571880	They soon began to mate primarily with other finches that used the same niche.
572440	576520	Over the course of many generations, these characteristics were enhanced,
576520	579640	enabling the finches to exploit their niches successfully.
580840	585240	The differences between the worm diggers and the seed crackers became so large that they
585240	590040	were no longer able to mate with one another. Different species emerged as a result.
592920	597160	Today, there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos Islands,
597160	600520	all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches.
601320	607640	This is how new species are created by evolution. Through the interaction of unique individuals,
607640	613960	the excess production of offspring, recombination and mutation in heredity,
613960	620040	and finally, through selection. Why is this so important?
620040	625800	It tells us where the variety of life comes from and why living creatures are so perfectly adapted
625800	632280	to their habitats. But it also affects us personally. Every person is the result of
632280	638440	three and a half billion years of evolution. And that includes you. Your ancestors fought
638440	644040	and adapted in order to survive. This survival was an extremely uncertain thing.
645640	650200	If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct,
650200	652840	then you can consider yourself part of a success story.
652840	659640	The dinosaurs have disappeared, but you are alive, watching this video.
660760	665400	Because you're incredibly special, just like all the other creatures that exist today.
666200	679400	Irreproducible and unique in the universe.
682840	707560	Thanks for watching!
