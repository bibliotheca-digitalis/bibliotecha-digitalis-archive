00:00.960 --> 00:04.020
Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.

00:04.200 --> 00:11.260
There's a visceral joy in blowing things up and a horrifying fascination with things like fireballs, shock waves, and radiation.

00:11.660 --> 00:14.620
And while it does help put our destructive power in perspective,

00:14.620 --> 00:18.720
it's not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.

00:19.060 --> 00:26.440
This isn't about city stacks of TNT or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.260
So we've partnered with the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement to explore

00:31.260 --> 00:38.780
what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today. Not nuclear war, just one explosion.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.860
We begin our story in the middle of downtown in a major city.

00:53.180 --> 00:58.000
People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.640
Right here, a nuclear weapon is detonated and time freezes.

01:03.220 --> 01:06.900
The first phase of the explosion happens within less than a second.

01:06.900 --> 01:13.700
In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than two kilometers across.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.100
Within this ball, everyone is just gone.

01:17.820 --> 01:23.540
Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan, a sizzle, and then there's nothing.

01:24.340 --> 01:30.380
Most buildings, cars, trees, tacky sculptures, and people all evaporated.

01:31.420 --> 01:36.260
First, the flash, an intense tsunami of light, washes over the city in an instant.

01:37.540 --> 01:43.420
If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion, it renders you blind for a few hours.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.020
The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse,

01:47.260 --> 01:53.300
so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometers from the detonation site.

01:53.980 --> 02:00.720
What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometers that is able to burn starts burning.

02:01.300 --> 02:05.180
Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin.

02:05.620 --> 02:11.860
If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment you're on your way to work, the next moment you're on fire.

02:13.540 --> 02:17.060
Now the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds.

02:18.580 --> 02:24.020
Most people will now first notice that something is wrong, but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.860
The flash is followed by the shockwave.

02:27.260 --> 02:34.780
The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super compressed air around it that's now expanding explosively.

02:35.300 --> 02:40.460
Faster than the speed of sound, creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.460
Human infrastructure is no match for its power.

02:44.220 --> 02:48.940
Most major buildings within a kilometer of the fireball are just ground up down to their base.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.580
Only steel-reinforced concrete is able to partially resist the pressure.

02:53.700 --> 03:01.060
In the surrounding parks, where retirees feed the ducks, trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.100
If you're outside, you get tossed away like a grain of dust in a tornado.

03:05.860 --> 03:09.620
The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards, but still about

03:10.340 --> 03:18.100
175 square kilometers of houses collapse like they're made of cards, trapping tens of thousands of people who didn't have any time to react.

03:18.940 --> 03:22.580
Gas stations explode and fires spread throughout the rubble.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.220
A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash

03:26.540 --> 03:32.260
rises kilometers into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city.

03:32.940 --> 03:39.420
This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city, destroying more buildings and providing an abundance of oxygen.

03:40.020 --> 03:47.100
It depends on the city what happens next. If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble,

03:47.260 --> 03:53.300
everybody trapped in it, and people trying to flee the devastation. Up to 21 kilometers from the explosion,

03:53.500 --> 03:57.500
people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud,

03:57.660 --> 04:03.780
unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them, about to shatter their windows and create a blizzard of sharp glass.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.820
The third phase begins in the coming hours and days.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.580
We're used to the idea that help will come no matter the disaster.

04:11.860 --> 04:17.260
This time is different. A nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once.

04:17.980 --> 04:21.820
There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries,

04:21.940 --> 04:29.260
nacerations, broken bones, serious burns. In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries.

04:32.140 --> 04:36.700
Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash,

04:36.860 --> 04:42.260
deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris.

04:42.700 --> 04:47.020
They're terrified, confused and don't know what's happened to them or why.

04:47.900 --> 04:55.820
Most likely many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings and most medical professionals are either dead or injured along with everyone else.

04:56.340 --> 05:03.900
The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet.

05:04.460 --> 05:11.980
Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather, an awful black rain can begin with radioactive ash and dust

05:12.220 --> 05:15.420
descending on the city covering everything and everyone.

05:15.980 --> 05:20.620
The invisible, malicious, silent horror of radiation takes its turn.

05:21.260 --> 05:29.820
Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die.

05:30.380 --> 05:34.040
There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days.

05:35.260 --> 05:43.020
Civilization doesn't operate when there is a total breakdown of infrastructure. Roads are blocked, train tracks walked, runways cluttered with rubble.

05:43.660 --> 05:49.100
No water, no electricity, no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from.

05:49.980 --> 05:58.700
Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close.

05:59.420 --> 06:02.060
After a nuclear attack, you're on your own.

06:03.180 --> 06:10.940
So bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot contaminated with radioactive fallout carrying what little they may have left.

06:11.500 --> 06:17.900
They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water, and medical treatment fast.

06:18.540 --> 06:23.900
And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears.

06:24.460 --> 06:33.420
The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries.

06:34.060 --> 06:40.080
In the weeks, months, and years to come, many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia.

06:40.940 --> 06:48.220
The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion.

06:48.700 --> 06:52.220
There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack.

06:52.940 --> 07:00.620
This is not a hurricane, wildfire, or earthquake, or nuclear accident. It is all of these things at once, but worse.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.980
No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it.

07:04.940 --> 07:12.540
The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons.

07:13.260 --> 07:18.220
Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades.

07:18.860 --> 07:25.020
Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons, but it's bad when anyone else gets them.

07:25.580 --> 07:30.300
That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.860
But does this make you feel safe?

07:33.420 --> 07:39.200
It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep, or a simple misunderstanding,

07:39.820 --> 07:43.200
to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.220
Exploding stuff in videos is fun.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.740
Exploding things in real life, not so much.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.540
There is a solution though.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.940
Eliminating all nuclear weapons and vowing never to build them again.

07:57.420 --> 08:03.980
In 2017, almost two-thirds of all the world's countries supported by hundreds of civil society organizations

08:04.060 --> 08:09.500
and the international red cross and red crescent movement agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.

08:10.300 --> 08:15.420
It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem.

08:16.060 --> 08:20.140
They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.820
No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on,

08:26.220 --> 08:28.780
we need to demand that they disappear forever.

08:29.500 --> 08:36.060
This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too.

08:36.860 --> 08:43.040
