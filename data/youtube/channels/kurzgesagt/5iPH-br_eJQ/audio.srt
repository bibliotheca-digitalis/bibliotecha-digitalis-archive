1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,020
Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,260
There's a visceral joy in blowing things up and a horrifying fascination with things like fireballs, shock waves, and radiation.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,620
And while it does help put our destructive power in perspective,

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,720
it's not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:26,440
This isn't about city stacks of TNT or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,260
So we've partnered with the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement to explore

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,780
what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today. Not nuclear war, just one explosion.

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,860
We begin our story in the middle of downtown in a major city.

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,000
People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives.

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,640
Right here, a nuclear weapon is detonated and time freezes.

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,900
The first phase of the explosion happens within less than a second.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,700
In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than two kilometers across.

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,100
Within this ball, everyone is just gone.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,540
Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan, a sizzle, and then there's nothing.

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,380
Most buildings, cars, trees, tacky sculptures, and people all evaporated.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,260
First, the flash, an intense tsunami of light, washes over the city in an instant.

17
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,420
If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion, it renders you blind for a few hours.

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,020
The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse,

19
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,300
so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometers from the detonation site.

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:00,720
What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometers that is able to burn starts burning.

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,180
Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin.

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,860
If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment you're on your way to work, the next moment you're on fire.

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Now the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds.

24
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,020
Most people will now first notice that something is wrong, but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands.

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,860
The flash is followed by the shockwave.

26
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,780
The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super compressed air around it that's now expanding explosively.

27
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,460
Faster than the speed of sound, creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes.

28
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,460
Human infrastructure is no match for its power.

29
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,940
Most major buildings within a kilometer of the fireball are just ground up down to their base.

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,580
Only steel-reinforced concrete is able to partially resist the pressure.

31
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,060
In the surrounding parks, where retirees feed the ducks, trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks.

32
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,100
If you're outside, you get tossed away like a grain of dust in a tornado.

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,620
The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards, but still about

34
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:18,100
175 square kilometers of houses collapse like they're made of cards, trapping tens of thousands of people who didn't have any time to react.

35
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,580
Gas stations explode and fires spread throughout the rubble.

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,220
A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,260
rises kilometers into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city.

38
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,420
This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city, destroying more buildings and providing an abundance of oxygen.

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:47,100
It depends on the city what happens next. If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble,

40
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,300
everybody trapped in it, and people trying to flee the devastation. Up to 21 kilometers from the explosion,

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud,

42
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,780
unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them, about to shatter their windows and create a blizzard of sharp glass.

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,820
The third phase begins in the coming hours and days.

44
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,580
We're used to the idea that help will come no matter the disaster.

45
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,260
This time is different. A nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once.

46
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,820
There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries,

47
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,260
nacerations, broken bones, serious burns. In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries.

48
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,700
Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash,

49
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,260
deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris.

50
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,020
They're terrified, confused and don't know what's happened to them or why.

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,820
Most likely many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings and most medical professionals are either dead or injured along with everyone else.

52
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:03,900
The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet.

53
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:11,980
Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather, an awful black rain can begin with radioactive ash and dust

54
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,420
descending on the city covering everything and everyone.

55
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,620
The invisible, malicious, silent horror of radiation takes its turn.

56
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:29,820
Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die.

57
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,040
There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days.

58
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:43,020
Civilization doesn't operate when there is a total breakdown of infrastructure. Roads are blocked, train tracks walked, runways cluttered with rubble.

59
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,100
No water, no electricity, no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from.

60
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:58,700
Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close.

61
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,060
After a nuclear attack, you're on your own.

62
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,940
So bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot contaminated with radioactive fallout carrying what little they may have left.

63
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,900
They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water, and medical treatment fast.

64
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,900
And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears.

65
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:33,420
The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries.

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,080
In the weeks, months, and years to come, many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia.

67
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,220
The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion.

68
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,220
There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack.

69
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,620
This is not a hurricane, wildfire, or earthquake, or nuclear accident. It is all of these things at once, but worse.

70
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,980
No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it.

71
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:12,540
The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons.

72
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,220
Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades.

73
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,020
Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons, but it's bad when anyone else gets them.

74
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,300
That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe.

75
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
But does this make you feel safe?

76
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,200
It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep, or a simple misunderstanding,

77
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,200
to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.

78
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,220
Exploding stuff in videos is fun.

79
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,740
Exploding things in real life, not so much.

80
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
There is a solution though.

81
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,940
Eliminating all nuclear weapons and vowing never to build them again.

82
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,980
In 2017, almost two-thirds of all the world's countries supported by hundreds of civil society organizations

83
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,500
and the international red cross and red crescent movement agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.

84
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,420
It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem.

85
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,140
They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us.

86
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,820
No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on,

87
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,780
we need to demand that they disappear forever.

88
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,060
This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too.

89
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,040
