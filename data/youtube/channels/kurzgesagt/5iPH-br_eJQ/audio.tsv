960	4020	Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun.
4200	11260	There's a visceral joy in blowing things up and a horrifying fascination with things like fireballs, shock waves, and radiation.
11660	14620	And while it does help put our destructive power in perspective,
14620	18720	it's not the best way of understanding the real impact of a nuclear explosion.
19060	26440	This isn't about city stacks of TNT or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you.
27100	31260	So we've partnered with the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement to explore
31260	38780	what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today. Not nuclear war, just one explosion.
49060	52860	We begin our story in the middle of downtown in a major city.
53180	58000	People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives.
58580	62640	Right here, a nuclear weapon is detonated and time freezes.
63220	66900	The first phase of the explosion happens within less than a second.
66900	73700	In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than two kilometers across.
74580	77100	Within this ball, everyone is just gone.
77820	83540	Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan, a sizzle, and then there's nothing.
84340	90380	Most buildings, cars, trees, tacky sculptures, and people all evaporated.
91420	96260	First, the flash, an intense tsunami of light, washes over the city in an instant.
97540	103420	If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion, it renders you blind for a few hours.
104020	107020	The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse,
107260	113300	so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometers from the detonation site.
113980	120720	What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometers that is able to burn starts burning.
121300	125180	Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin.
125620	131860	If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment you're on your way to work, the next moment you're on fire.
133540	137060	Now the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds.
138580	144020	Most people will now first notice that something is wrong, but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands.
144620	146860	The flash is followed by the shockwave.
147260	154780	The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super compressed air around it that's now expanding explosively.
155300	160460	Faster than the speed of sound, creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes.
160940	163460	Human infrastructure is no match for its power.
164220	168940	Most major buildings within a kilometer of the fireball are just ground up down to their base.
169580	173580	Only steel-reinforced concrete is able to partially resist the pressure.
173700	181060	In the surrounding parks, where retirees feed the ducks, trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks.
181060	185100	If you're outside, you get tossed away like a grain of dust in a tornado.
185860	189620	The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards, but still about
190340	198100	175 square kilometers of houses collapse like they're made of cards, trapping tens of thousands of people who didn't have any time to react.
198940	202580	Gas stations explode and fires spread throughout the rubble.
202900	206220	A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash
206540	212260	rises kilometers into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city.
212940	219420	This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city, destroying more buildings and providing an abundance of oxygen.
220020	227100	It depends on the city what happens next. If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble,
227260	233300	everybody trapped in it, and people trying to flee the devastation. Up to 21 kilometers from the explosion,
233500	237500	people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud,
237660	243780	unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them, about to shatter their windows and create a blizzard of sharp glass.
244980	247820	The third phase begins in the coming hours and days.
248100	251580	We're used to the idea that help will come no matter the disaster.
251860	257260	This time is different. A nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once.
257980	261820	There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries,
261940	269260	nacerations, broken bones, serious burns. In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries.
272140	276700	Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash,
276860	282260	deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris.
282700	287020	They're terrified, confused and don't know what's happened to them or why.
287900	295820	Most likely many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings and most medical professionals are either dead or injured along with everyone else.
296340	303900	The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet.
304460	311980	Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather, an awful black rain can begin with radioactive ash and dust
312220	315420	descending on the city covering everything and everyone.
315980	320620	The invisible, malicious, silent horror of radiation takes its turn.
321260	329820	Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die.
330380	334040	There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days.
335260	343020	Civilization doesn't operate when there is a total breakdown of infrastructure. Roads are blocked, train tracks walked, runways cluttered with rubble.
343660	349100	No water, no electricity, no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from.
349980	358700	Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close.
359420	362060	After a nuclear attack, you're on your own.
363180	370940	So bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot contaminated with radioactive fallout carrying what little they may have left.
371500	377900	They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water, and medical treatment fast.
378540	383900	And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears.
384460	393420	The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries.
394060	400080	In the weeks, months, and years to come, many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia.
400940	408220	The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion.
408700	412220	There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack.
412940	420620	This is not a hurricane, wildfire, or earthquake, or nuclear accident. It is all of these things at once, but worse.
421500	423980	No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it.
424940	432540	The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons.
433260	438220	Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades.
438860	445020	Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons, but it's bad when anyone else gets them.
445580	450300	That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe.
450860	452860	But does this make you feel safe?
453420	459200	It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep, or a simple misunderstanding,
459820	463200	to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.
463980	466220	Exploding stuff in videos is fun.
466840	469740	Exploding things in real life, not so much.
470540	472540	There is a solution though.
473080	476940	Eliminating all nuclear weapons and vowing never to build them again.
477420	483980	In 2017, almost two-thirds of all the world's countries supported by hundreds of civil society organizations
484060	489500	and the international red cross and red crescent movement agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.
490300	495420	It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem.
496060	500140	They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us.
501100	505820	No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on,
506220	508780	we need to demand that they disappear forever.
509500	516060	This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too.
