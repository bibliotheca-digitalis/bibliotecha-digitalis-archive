0	5600	The observable universe is a big place that's been around for more than 13
5600	11960	billion years. Up to 2 trillion galaxies made up of something like 20,000 billion
11960	18320	billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the Milky Way alone, scientists assume
18320	22960	there are some 40 billion Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their
22960	28360	stars. When we look at these numbers, it's hard to imagine that there is nobody
28400	33660	else out there. It would change our perception of ourselves forever if we
33660	39120	found others. Just knowing that this vast place is not dead would shift our
39120	44360	perspective outwards and could help us get over our irrelevant quarrels. But
44360	49000	before looking for our new best friends or worst enemies, we have a problem to
49000	53400	solve. What are we actually looking for?
59320	64840	In a universe that big and old, we have to assume that civilizations start
64840	68760	millions of years apart from each other and develop in different directions and
68760	73920	speeds. So not only are we looking over distances of dozens to hundreds of
73920	78360	thousands of light-years, we're looking for a civilization ranging from cavemen
78360	83440	to super advanced. So we need a conceptual framework to enable us to
83440	88260	think better thoughts that make us able to search better. Are there universal
88260	93820	rules that intelligent species follow? Currently, our civilization sample size
93820	98780	is only one, so we may make incorrect assumptions based solely on ourselves.
98780	104260	Still, better than nothing. We know that humans started out with nothing but
104260	108740	minds and hands that could build tools. We know that humans are curious,
108740	114540	competitive, greedy for resources, and expansionist. The more of these qualities
114580	118660	our ancestors had, the more successful they were in the civilization building
118660	123940	game. Being one with nature is nice, but it's not the path to irrigation systems
123940	129380	or gunpowder or cities. So it's reasonable to assume that aliens are able
129380	135000	to take over their home planet also have these qualities. And if aliens have to
135000	138900	follow the same laws of physics, then there is a measurable metric for
139420	145300	Human progress can be measured very precisely by how much energy we
145300	150420	extracted from our environment and how we made it usable to do things. We started
150420	155140	with muscles until we learned to control fire. Then we made machines that used
155140	159700	kinetic energy from water and wind. As our machines got better and our
159700	164020	knowledge of materials expanded, we began to harness the concentrated energy from
164020	168460	dead plants we dug up from the ground. As our energy consumption grew
168460	174020	exponentially, so did the abilities of our civilization. Between 1800 and 2015,
174020	180060	population size had increased sevenfold, while humanity was consuming 25 times
180060	184860	more energy. It's likely that this process will continue into the far
184860	190420	future. Based on these facts, scientist Nikolai Kardashev developed a method of
190420	195020	categorizing civilizations from cave dwellers to gods ruling over galaxies.
195020	201300	The Kardashev scale, a method of ranking civilizations by their energy use. The
201300	205980	scale has been refined and expanded on over the decades, but in general it puts
205980	211620	civilizations into four different categories. A type 1 civilization is able
211620	216580	to use the available energy of their home planet. A type 2 civilization is
216580	221860	able to use the available energy of their star and planetary system. A type
221860	227200	3 civilization is able to use the available energy of their galaxy. A type
227200	232260	4 civilization is able to use the available energy of multiple galaxies.
232260	237700	These levels differ by orders of magnitude. It's like comparing an ant
237700	243660	colony to a human metropolitan area. To ants, we are so complex and powerful we
243660	248660	might as well be gods. So to make the scale more useful, we need subcategories.
248660	253580	On the lower end of the spectrum, there are type 0 to type 1 civilizations.
253580	257640	Anything from hunter-gatherers to something we could achieve in the next
257640	263300	few hundred years. These might actually be abundant in the Milky Way, but a
263300	267340	civilization that is not actively transmitting radio signals into space
267340	272100	might be as close as our nearest stellar neighbor, the Alpha Centauri system, and
272100	277160	we would have no way of realizing they exist. But even if they transmitted
277160	282340	radio signals like we do, it might not be very helpful. On an interstellar scale,
282340	288660	humanity is practically invisible. Our signals may extend over an impressive
288660	294680	200 light-years, but this is only a tiny fraction of the Milky Way. And even if
294680	299140	someone were listening, after a few light-years our signals decay into noise,
299180	304740	impossible to identify as the source of an intelligent species. Today, humanity
304740	310620	ranks at about level 0.75. We have altered our planet. We've created huge
310620	315220	structures, mined and stripped mountains, removed rainforests and drain swamps.
315220	319540	We've created rivers and lakes and changed the composition and temperature
319540	325260	of the atmosphere. If progress continues and we don't make Earth uninhabitable, we
325260	330580	will become a full Type 1 civilization in the next few hundred years. Any
330580	334580	civilization that becomes a Type 1 is bound to look outside because it's
334580	339380	likely that it's still curious, competitive, greedy and expansionist. The
339380	343040	next reasonable step towards transitioning to Type 2 is trying to
343040	348380	alter and mine other planets and bodies. This might start with outposts in space,
348380	352280	transition to infrastructure and industries near the home planet, move on
352280	355840	to colonies and end with terraforming other planets by changing their
355840	361040	atmosphere, their rotation or position. As a civilization expands and uses more
361040	365640	and more stuff and space, its energy consumption scales with them. So at some
365640	369900	point, they may embark on the largest project a lower Type 2 civilization can
369900	375960	take on, harnessing the energy of their star by building a Dyson swarm. Once this
375960	380320	megastructure is finished, energy has become practically unlimited for molding
380320	385360	the home system however they see fit. If they are still curious, competitive,
385360	389840	greedy and expansionist and now have complete control over their home system,
389840	394040	stellar infrastructure in place and the energy output of a star, the next
394040	399360	frontier moves to other stars light years away. For a Type 2 civilization,
399360	402880	the distance to other stars might feel like the distance between Earth and
402880	407160	Pluto does to us today. Technically within reach but only with immense
407160	412480	investments in terms of time, ingenuity and resources. This begins their
412480	417760	transition towards Type 3. This step is so far beyond us that it becomes hard to
417760	421680	imagine what exactly these challenges will look like and how they'll be solved.
421680	426440	Will they be able to find a solution to the vast distances and travel times of
426440	431120	hundreds or thousands of years? Will they be able to communicate and keep a shared
431120	436440	culture and biology between colonies light years apart? Or will they split
436440	442120	into separate Type 2 civilizations? Maybe even different species? Are there
442120	447960	deadly challenges between the stars? So the closer a species gets to Type 3, the
447960	451840	harder it becomes to fathom what it might actually look like. They might
451840	457000	discover new physics, may understand and control dark matter and energy or be
457000	461960	able to travel faster than light. We might be unable to grasp their motives,
461960	468080	technology and actions. Humans are the ants trying to understand the galactic
468080	473280	metropolitan area. A high Type 2 civilization might already consider
473280	479200	humanity too primitive to even talk to. A Type 3 civilization might feel about us
479200	483480	like we feel about the bacteria living on the anthill. Maybe they wouldn't even
483480	488920	consider us conscious or our survival relevant. We could only pray that they're
488920	495040	nice gods. But the scale doesn't necessarily end here. Some scientists
495040	499680	suggest there might be Type 4 and Type 5 civilizations whose influence stretches
499680	503960	over galaxy clusters or super clusters, structures comprising thousands of
503960	509280	galaxies and trillions of stars. Ultimately there might be a Type Omega
509280	514880	civilization, able to manipulate the entire universe and possibly others. Type
514880	520480	Omega civilizations might be the actual creators of our universe for reasons
520480	525600	beyond our comprehension. Maybe they were just bored. As flawed as this
525600	529240	classification may be, this thought experiment is already telling us
529240	534000	interesting things. If our ideas about the nature of species that form
534000	538480	interstellar civilizations is sort of correct, then we can be pretty sure that
538480	543600	there are no civilizations of Type 3 and beyond near the Milky Way. Their
543600	547920	influence would in all likelihood be so all-encompassing and their technology so
547920	552520	far above our own that we couldn't miss them. The galaxies should flash with
552520	557240	their activity in thousands of star systems. We should be able to see or
557240	561240	detect their artifacts or movements between different parts of their empire.
561240	567000	Even if a Type 3 civilization did exist in the past and died a mysterious death,
567000	571880	we should be able to detect some of the remnants of their empire. But when
571880	576440	scientists looked, they didn't find remnants of harvested stars, decaying
576440	582240	megastructures, or scars of great interstellar wars. So they're very likely
582240	587480	not out there and never were. In a sense, this is very sad but also very
587480	594160	reassuring. It leaves the galaxy to us and others similar to us. So the most
594160	598280	promising civilizations to look for may be somewhere in the spectrum from Type
598280	604040	1.5 to Type 2.5. They wouldn't be too advanced to understand them and their
604040	608520	motives. They may have finished their first megastructures and they might be
608520	612520	in the process of moving stuff between stars and transmitting enormous amounts
612520	618280	of information into space by accident or on purpose. They would probably also look
618280	623640	to the stars and look for others. Then again, maybe we've got it all wrong. Maybe
623800	629320	progress to Type 2 does not mean expanding outwards and humanity is still
629320	634920	too immature to imagine otherwise. For now, all we really know is that we
634920	642600	haven't seen anybody yet, but we've only just started looking. Until we finally
642600	646600	find friendly super aliens and can ask them to explain the rules of the
646600	650920	universe to us, most of us have to make do with learning stuff ourselves. Whether
650920	653800	you're going back to school leaving home for the first time or if you're
