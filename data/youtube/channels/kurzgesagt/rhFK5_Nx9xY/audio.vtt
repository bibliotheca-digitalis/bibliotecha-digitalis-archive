00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
The observable universe is a big place that's been around for more than 13

00:05.600 --> 00:11.960
billion years. Up to 2 trillion galaxies made up of something like 20,000 billion

00:11.960 --> 00:18.320
billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the Milky Way alone, scientists assume

00:18.320 --> 00:22.960
there are some 40 billion Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their

00:22.960 --> 00:28.360
stars. When we look at these numbers, it's hard to imagine that there is nobody

00:28.400 --> 00:33.660
else out there. It would change our perception of ourselves forever if we

00:33.660 --> 00:39.120
found others. Just knowing that this vast place is not dead would shift our

00:39.120 --> 00:44.360
perspective outwards and could help us get over our irrelevant quarrels. But

00:44.360 --> 00:49.000
before looking for our new best friends or worst enemies, we have a problem to

00:49.000 --> 00:53.400
solve. What are we actually looking for?

00:59.320 --> 01:04.840
In a universe that big and old, we have to assume that civilizations start

01:04.840 --> 01:08.760
millions of years apart from each other and develop in different directions and

01:08.760 --> 01:13.920
speeds. So not only are we looking over distances of dozens to hundreds of

01:13.920 --> 01:18.360
thousands of light-years, we're looking for a civilization ranging from cavemen

01:18.360 --> 01:23.440
to super advanced. So we need a conceptual framework to enable us to

01:23.440 --> 01:28.260
think better thoughts that make us able to search better. Are there universal

01:28.260 --> 01:33.820
rules that intelligent species follow? Currently, our civilization sample size

01:33.820 --> 01:38.780
is only one, so we may make incorrect assumptions based solely on ourselves.

01:38.780 --> 01:44.260
Still, better than nothing. We know that humans started out with nothing but

01:44.260 --> 01:48.740
minds and hands that could build tools. We know that humans are curious,

01:48.740 --> 01:54.540
competitive, greedy for resources, and expansionist. The more of these qualities

01:54.580 --> 01:58.660
our ancestors had, the more successful they were in the civilization building

01:58.660 --> 02:03.940
game. Being one with nature is nice, but it's not the path to irrigation systems

02:03.940 --> 02:09.380
or gunpowder or cities. So it's reasonable to assume that aliens are able

02:09.380 --> 02:15.000
to take over their home planet also have these qualities. And if aliens have to

02:15.000 --> 02:18.900
follow the same laws of physics, then there is a measurable metric for

02:19.420 --> 02:25.300
Human progress can be measured very precisely by how much energy we

02:25.300 --> 02:30.420
extracted from our environment and how we made it usable to do things. We started

02:30.420 --> 02:35.140
with muscles until we learned to control fire. Then we made machines that used

02:35.140 --> 02:39.700
kinetic energy from water and wind. As our machines got better and our

02:39.700 --> 02:44.020
knowledge of materials expanded, we began to harness the concentrated energy from

02:44.020 --> 02:48.460
dead plants we dug up from the ground. As our energy consumption grew

02:48.460 --> 02:54.020
exponentially, so did the abilities of our civilization. Between 1800 and 2015,

02:54.020 --> 03:00.060
population size had increased sevenfold, while humanity was consuming 25 times

03:00.060 --> 03:04.860
more energy. It's likely that this process will continue into the far

03:04.860 --> 03:10.420
future. Based on these facts, scientist Nikolai Kardashev developed a method of

03:10.420 --> 03:15.020
categorizing civilizations from cave dwellers to gods ruling over galaxies.

03:15.020 --> 03:21.300
The Kardashev scale, a method of ranking civilizations by their energy use. The

03:21.300 --> 03:25.980
scale has been refined and expanded on over the decades, but in general it puts

03:25.980 --> 03:31.620
civilizations into four different categories. A type 1 civilization is able

03:31.620 --> 03:36.580
to use the available energy of their home planet. A type 2 civilization is

03:36.580 --> 03:41.860
able to use the available energy of their star and planetary system. A type

03:41.860 --> 03:47.200
3 civilization is able to use the available energy of their galaxy. A type

03:47.200 --> 03:52.260
4 civilization is able to use the available energy of multiple galaxies.

03:52.260 --> 03:57.700
These levels differ by orders of magnitude. It's like comparing an ant

03:57.700 --> 04:03.660
colony to a human metropolitan area. To ants, we are so complex and powerful we

04:03.660 --> 04:08.660
might as well be gods. So to make the scale more useful, we need subcategories.

04:08.660 --> 04:13.580
On the lower end of the spectrum, there are type 0 to type 1 civilizations.

04:13.580 --> 04:17.640
Anything from hunter-gatherers to something we could achieve in the next

04:17.640 --> 04:23.300
few hundred years. These might actually be abundant in the Milky Way, but a

04:23.300 --> 04:27.340
civilization that is not actively transmitting radio signals into space

04:27.340 --> 04:32.100
might be as close as our nearest stellar neighbor, the Alpha Centauri system, and

04:32.100 --> 04:37.160
we would have no way of realizing they exist. But even if they transmitted

04:37.160 --> 04:42.340
radio signals like we do, it might not be very helpful. On an interstellar scale,

04:42.340 --> 04:48.660
humanity is practically invisible. Our signals may extend over an impressive

04:48.660 --> 04:54.680
200 light-years, but this is only a tiny fraction of the Milky Way. And even if

04:54.680 --> 04:59.140
someone were listening, after a few light-years our signals decay into noise,

04:59.180 --> 05:04.740
impossible to identify as the source of an intelligent species. Today, humanity

05:04.740 --> 05:10.620
ranks at about level 0.75. We have altered our planet. We've created huge

05:10.620 --> 05:15.220
structures, mined and stripped mountains, removed rainforests and drain swamps.

05:15.220 --> 05:19.540
We've created rivers and lakes and changed the composition and temperature

05:19.540 --> 05:25.260
of the atmosphere. If progress continues and we don't make Earth uninhabitable, we

05:25.260 --> 05:30.580
will become a full Type 1 civilization in the next few hundred years. Any

05:30.580 --> 05:34.580
civilization that becomes a Type 1 is bound to look outside because it's

05:34.580 --> 05:39.380
likely that it's still curious, competitive, greedy and expansionist. The

05:39.380 --> 05:43.040
next reasonable step towards transitioning to Type 2 is trying to

05:43.040 --> 05:48.380
alter and mine other planets and bodies. This might start with outposts in space,

05:48.380 --> 05:52.280
transition to infrastructure and industries near the home planet, move on

05:52.280 --> 05:55.840
to colonies and end with terraforming other planets by changing their

05:55.840 --> 06:01.040
atmosphere, their rotation or position. As a civilization expands and uses more

06:01.040 --> 06:05.640
and more stuff and space, its energy consumption scales with them. So at some

06:05.640 --> 06:09.900
point, they may embark on the largest project a lower Type 2 civilization can

06:09.900 --> 06:15.960
take on, harnessing the energy of their star by building a Dyson swarm. Once this

06:15.960 --> 06:20.320
megastructure is finished, energy has become practically unlimited for molding

06:20.320 --> 06:25.360
the home system however they see fit. If they are still curious, competitive,

06:25.360 --> 06:29.840
greedy and expansionist and now have complete control over their home system,

06:29.840 --> 06:34.040
stellar infrastructure in place and the energy output of a star, the next

06:34.040 --> 06:39.360
frontier moves to other stars light years away. For a Type 2 civilization,

06:39.360 --> 06:42.880
the distance to other stars might feel like the distance between Earth and

06:42.880 --> 06:47.160
Pluto does to us today. Technically within reach but only with immense

06:47.160 --> 06:52.480
investments in terms of time, ingenuity and resources. This begins their

06:52.480 --> 06:57.760
transition towards Type 3. This step is so far beyond us that it becomes hard to

06:57.760 --> 07:01.680
imagine what exactly these challenges will look like and how they'll be solved.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.440
Will they be able to find a solution to the vast distances and travel times of

07:06.440 --> 07:11.120
hundreds or thousands of years? Will they be able to communicate and keep a shared

07:11.120 --> 07:16.440
culture and biology between colonies light years apart? Or will they split

07:16.440 --> 07:22.120
into separate Type 2 civilizations? Maybe even different species? Are there

07:22.120 --> 07:27.960
deadly challenges between the stars? So the closer a species gets to Type 3, the

07:27.960 --> 07:31.840
harder it becomes to fathom what it might actually look like. They might

07:31.840 --> 07:37.000
discover new physics, may understand and control dark matter and energy or be

07:37.000 --> 07:41.960
able to travel faster than light. We might be unable to grasp their motives,

07:41.960 --> 07:48.080
technology and actions. Humans are the ants trying to understand the galactic

07:48.080 --> 07:53.280
metropolitan area. A high Type 2 civilization might already consider

07:53.280 --> 07:59.200
humanity too primitive to even talk to. A Type 3 civilization might feel about us

07:59.200 --> 08:03.480
like we feel about the bacteria living on the anthill. Maybe they wouldn't even

08:03.480 --> 08:08.920
consider us conscious or our survival relevant. We could only pray that they're

08:08.920 --> 08:15.040
nice gods. But the scale doesn't necessarily end here. Some scientists

08:15.040 --> 08:19.680
suggest there might be Type 4 and Type 5 civilizations whose influence stretches

08:19.680 --> 08:23.960
over galaxy clusters or super clusters, structures comprising thousands of

08:23.960 --> 08:29.280
galaxies and trillions of stars. Ultimately there might be a Type Omega

08:29.280 --> 08:34.880
civilization, able to manipulate the entire universe and possibly others. Type

08:34.880 --> 08:40.480
Omega civilizations might be the actual creators of our universe for reasons

08:40.480 --> 08:45.600
beyond our comprehension. Maybe they were just bored. As flawed as this

08:45.600 --> 08:49.240
classification may be, this thought experiment is already telling us

08:49.240 --> 08:54.000
interesting things. If our ideas about the nature of species that form

08:54.000 --> 08:58.480
interstellar civilizations is sort of correct, then we can be pretty sure that

08:58.480 --> 09:03.600
there are no civilizations of Type 3 and beyond near the Milky Way. Their

09:03.600 --> 09:07.920
influence would in all likelihood be so all-encompassing and their technology so

09:07.920 --> 09:12.520
far above our own that we couldn't miss them. The galaxies should flash with

09:12.520 --> 09:17.240
their activity in thousands of star systems. We should be able to see or

09:17.240 --> 09:21.240
detect their artifacts or movements between different parts of their empire.

09:21.240 --> 09:27.000
Even if a Type 3 civilization did exist in the past and died a mysterious death,

09:27.000 --> 09:31.880
we should be able to detect some of the remnants of their empire. But when

09:31.880 --> 09:36.440
scientists looked, they didn't find remnants of harvested stars, decaying

09:36.440 --> 09:42.240
megastructures, or scars of great interstellar wars. So they're very likely

09:42.240 --> 09:47.480
not out there and never were. In a sense, this is very sad but also very

09:47.480 --> 09:54.160
reassuring. It leaves the galaxy to us and others similar to us. So the most

09:54.160 --> 09:58.280
promising civilizations to look for may be somewhere in the spectrum from Type

09:58.280 --> 10:04.040
1.5 to Type 2.5. They wouldn't be too advanced to understand them and their

10:04.040 --> 10:08.520
motives. They may have finished their first megastructures and they might be

10:08.520 --> 10:12.520
in the process of moving stuff between stars and transmitting enormous amounts

10:12.520 --> 10:18.280
of information into space by accident or on purpose. They would probably also look

10:18.280 --> 10:23.640
to the stars and look for others. Then again, maybe we've got it all wrong. Maybe

10:23.800 --> 10:29.320
progress to Type 2 does not mean expanding outwards and humanity is still

10:29.320 --> 10:34.920
too immature to imagine otherwise. For now, all we really know is that we

10:34.920 --> 10:42.600
haven't seen anybody yet, but we've only just started looking. Until we finally

10:42.600 --> 10:46.600
find friendly super aliens and can ask them to explain the rules of the

10:46.600 --> 10:50.920
universe to us, most of us have to make do with learning stuff ourselves. Whether

10:50.920 --> 10:53.800
you're going back to school leaving home for the first time or if you're

10:53.800 --> 10:57.320
just entering a new phase in your life, our shop is stocked and ready for all

10:57.320 --> 11:02.440
your back-to-school needs. Notebooks and notepads to organize your work. Stickers

11:02.440 --> 11:06.800
and mugs to make things look nice. Lots and lots of posters to turn your dorm or

11:06.800 --> 11:11.960
room into an inspiring oasis of knowledge. We have new shirts and, for the

11:11.960 --> 11:17.040
first time, a Kurzgesagt earth sweater. All of these products are designed and

11:17.040 --> 11:21.960
produced with love by the Kurzgesagt merch burbs. Our merch is the easiest way

11:21.960 --> 11:26.080
to support what we do and keep our videos free for everyone. Thank you for

11:26.080 --> 11:28.280
watching.
