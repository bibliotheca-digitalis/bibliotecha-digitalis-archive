0	5000	Planet Earth is the home of every life form known to us in the universe.
5000	11000	Its age is about a third of the age of the universe and, admit it, it is a thing of beauty.
11000	18000	A slightly squashed sphere with a heavy metal core and a lighter surface crust wrapped in a thin sliver of sweet air to breathe,
18000	26000	with vast oceans, fertile plains, magnificent mountains, freshwater rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers,
26000	30000	orbiting a star which warms us and gives us energy.
30000	35000	But how did our home come into existence and what's it made of?
42000	49000	4.6 billion years ago, Earth was created from the remnants of dead stars that collected in a giant dirty gas cloud.
49000	54000	The gas cloud became denser in its center and formed an accretion disk.
54000	62000	Small particles started clumping together and building larger and larger objects until they formed the objects we call planets today.
62000	67000	This process took 10 to 20 million years and is still not very well understood.
67000	74000	At about this time when the solar system was young and chaotic, a giant object about as big as Mars collided with our home.
74000	80000	The impact was violent and if the object had been more massive, it might have destroyed Earth.
80000	88000	Material from Earth was smashed out into orbit and formed the Moon, which is the biggest satellite in relation to its planet in the solar system.
88000	96000	At this time, Earth was a hot hell, constantly being hit by asteroids, with seas of lava and a toxic atmosphere.
96000	101000	But something was about to change drastically. Earth cooled down.
101000	108000	Water from the inside of the Earth wandered to the surface and rained down on Earth, only to vaporize again and become clouds.
108000	112000	Millions of asteroids brought more and more water to our planet.
112000	117000	All the water on Earth has about this volume compared to Earth.
117000	122000	Today, the surface of Earth is 71% water and 29% land.
122000	128000	97.5% is saline water, while only 2.5% is freshwater.
128000	137000	The freshwater is 69% ice and snow, 30% are groundwaters, and only about 1% make up the remaining groundwaters.
137000	140000	But even this small part is mostly frozen.
140000	147000	Only a tiny part of our water is actually lakes and rivers, and an even tinier part is bound in living things.
147000	152000	So, gradually the Earth cooled down and the surface formed a thin crust.
152000	159000	But inside the Earth, hot rock continued to swirl about, moving the crust from below and breaking it apart.
159000	163000	This process is called plate tectonics and is happening right now.
163000	166000	We'll make a whole video about it in the future.
166000	171000	For now, let's just say that the crust of Earth consists of separate giant plates that move around.
171000	175000	As they meet, they crumble and create mighty mountains.
175000	180000	Or violently plunge back down deeper into Earth, creating deep trenches.
180000	185000	That's the way the highest place on Earth was formed, Mount Everest, and the deepest, the Mariana Trench.
185000	190000	From our perspective, Earth's mountains and trenches are mighty indeed.
190000	195000	But when you look at the Earth in cross-section, you can see how tiny they actually are.
195000	202000	The part we stand on is the crust, which is about 50 km thick, though it can vary between 5 and 70 km.
202000	207000	By the way, the deepest hole ever drilled by man is 12.262 km deep.
207000	209000	After the crust comes the mantle.
209000	214000	It's a silicate rocky shell and about 2,900 km thick.
214000	217000	The mantle consists of the upper mantle and the lower mantle.
217000	220000	The upper mantle has different regions too.
220000	224000	Its upper part, which is viscous and carries the crust, is called the lithosphere.
224000	230000	After that, there comes the asthenosphere, which consists of less mobile, mostly solid material.
230000	234000	The lower mantle reaches deep down to the outer core of Earth.
234000	240000	Earth's outer core is a liquid layer of iron and nickel about 2,266 km thick.
240000	246000	Temperatures vary from 4,000°C to 5,700°C.
246000	249000	And in the center is the inner core.
249000	255000	It's mostly solid, a ball made of an iron-nickel alloy with a radius of about 1,200 km.
255000	260000	70% the size of the Moon and about the temperature of the surface of the Sun.
260000	265000	It is slowly growing at an estimated rate of about 1 mm per year.
265000	267000	Now for some perspective.
267000	273000	This small layer of crystallized milk products of former molten mantle is where we live.
273000	276000	Then there's Earth's magnetic field.
276000	281000	It's an invisible phenomenon that diverts high energy particles coming from the Sun and other sources,
281000	286000	allowing for a stable environment with comparatively little radiation impact on Earth.
286000	288000	But why is it there?
288000	291000	Actually, we don't really know a terrible lot about that.
291000	294000	We know it has something to do with the core of the Earth.
294000	299000	Inside this metal sphere, large electrical currents flow in complicated patterns.
299000	305000	They cause a magnetic field that sort of stabilizes itself according to the laws of electrodynamics.
305000	308000	This entire system is called the dynamo.
308000	312000	But don't let us fool you into thinking we have it all figured out.
312000	318000	Speaking of breathtaking information, what about the airy stuff that surrounds us?
318000	324000	By volume, dry air consists mostly of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon,
324000	328000	a variable amount of water vapor and small amounts of other gases.
328000	334000	Humans are very dependent on the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, where the weather is.
334000	337000	It's 12 kilometers thick on average.
337000	343000	Above that is the stratosphere, which is where the ozone layer protects us from the Sun's most aggressive type of light.
343000	350000	Above that is the mesosphere, the coolest place on Earth, with an average temperature around minus 85 degrees Celsius.
350000	354000	At about 80 kilometers up, the thermosphere starts.
354000	360000	The transition to space is a fluent one without clear borders, but humans decided that space starts here.
360000	366000	At about 100 kilometers, Earth stops and space begins, though the atmosphere extends a bit further.
366000	372000	In this region we find the ionosphere, the aurora borealis and the ISS.
372000	378000	And the outermost layer is the exosphere, stretching up to 10,000 kilometers.
378000	382000	It merges fluently with outer space, where there's no atmosphere at all.
382000	389000	The atoms and molecules in this area are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with each other.
389000	395000	Okay, humans in their present form have only been around for 200,000 years.
395000	400000	That's 0.004% of Earth's history. Not long, really.
400000	405000	And here we are now, living in a thin, moist layer on a small, wet rock.
405000	408000	We call this rock Earth.
408000	415000	It is the product of the universe's deepest workings, the result of a constant process of creation and destruction,
415000	422000	happening all over the universe all the time, helped by chance, the laws of the universe and random events.
422000	425000	We are really lucky.
