1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Planet Earth is the home of every life form known to us in the universe.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Its age is about a third of the age of the universe and, admit it, it is a thing of beauty.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A slightly squashed sphere with a heavy metal core and a lighter surface crust wrapped in a thin sliver of sweet air to breathe,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with vast oceans, fertile plains, magnificent mountains, freshwater rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
orbiting a star which warms us and gives us energy.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But how did our home come into existence and what's it made of?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
4.6 billion years ago, Earth was created from the remnants of dead stars that collected in a giant dirty gas cloud.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The gas cloud became denser in its center and formed an accretion disk.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Small particles started clumping together and building larger and larger objects until they formed the objects we call planets today.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This process took 10 to 20 million years and is still not very well understood.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At about this time when the solar system was young and chaotic, a giant object about as big as Mars collided with our home.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The impact was violent and if the object had been more massive, it might have destroyed Earth.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Material from Earth was smashed out into orbit and formed the Moon, which is the biggest satellite in relation to its planet in the solar system.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At this time, Earth was a hot hell, constantly being hit by asteroids, with seas of lava and a toxic atmosphere.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But something was about to change drastically. Earth cooled down.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Water from the inside of the Earth wandered to the surface and rained down on Earth, only to vaporize again and become clouds.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Millions of asteroids brought more and more water to our planet.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All the water on Earth has about this volume compared to Earth.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Today, the surface of Earth is 71% water and 29% land.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
97.5% is saline water, while only 2.5% is freshwater.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The freshwater is 69% ice and snow, 30% are groundwaters, and only about 1% make up the remaining groundwaters.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But even this small part is mostly frozen.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Only a tiny part of our water is actually lakes and rivers, and an even tinier part is bound in living things.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, gradually the Earth cooled down and the surface formed a thin crust.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But inside the Earth, hot rock continued to swirl about, moving the crust from below and breaking it apart.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This process is called plate tectonics and is happening right now.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We'll make a whole video about it in the future.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For now, let's just say that the crust of Earth consists of separate giant plates that move around.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As they meet, they crumble and create mighty mountains.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or violently plunge back down deeper into Earth, creating deep trenches.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's the way the highest place on Earth was formed, Mount Everest, and the deepest, the Mariana Trench.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
From our perspective, Earth's mountains and trenches are mighty indeed.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But when you look at the Earth in cross-section, you can see how tiny they actually are.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The part we stand on is the crust, which is about 50 km thick, though it can vary between 5 and 70 km.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
By the way, the deepest hole ever drilled by man is 12.262 km deep.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
After the crust comes the mantle.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a silicate rocky shell and about 2,900 km thick.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The mantle consists of the upper mantle and the lower mantle.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The upper mantle has different regions too.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Its upper part, which is viscous and carries the crust, is called the lithosphere.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
After that, there comes the asthenosphere, which consists of less mobile, mostly solid material.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The lower mantle reaches deep down to the outer core of Earth.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Earth's outer core is a liquid layer of iron and nickel about 2,266 km thick.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Temperatures vary from 4,000°C to 5,700°C.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And in the center is the inner core.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's mostly solid, a ball made of an iron-nickel alloy with a radius of about 1,200 km.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
70% the size of the Moon and about the temperature of the surface of the Sun.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It is slowly growing at an estimated rate of about 1 mm per year.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now for some perspective.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This small layer of crystallized milk products of former molten mantle is where we live.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then there's Earth's magnetic field.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's an invisible phenomenon that diverts high energy particles coming from the Sun and other sources,

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
allowing for a stable environment with comparatively little radiation impact on Earth.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But why is it there?

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Actually, we don't really know a terrible lot about that.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We know it has something to do with the core of the Earth.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Inside this metal sphere, large electrical currents flow in complicated patterns.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They cause a magnetic field that sort of stabilizes itself according to the laws of electrodynamics.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This entire system is called the dynamo.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But don't let us fool you into thinking we have it all figured out.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Speaking of breathtaking information, what about the airy stuff that surrounds us?

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
By volume, dry air consists mostly of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon,

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
a variable amount of water vapor and small amounts of other gases.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Humans are very dependent on the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, where the weather is.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's 12 kilometers thick on average.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Above that is the stratosphere, which is where the ozone layer protects us from the Sun's most aggressive type of light.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Above that is the mesosphere, the coolest place on Earth, with an average temperature around minus 85 degrees Celsius.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
At about 80 kilometers up, the thermosphere starts.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The transition to space is a fluent one without clear borders, but humans decided that space starts here.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
At about 100 kilometers, Earth stops and space begins, though the atmosphere extends a bit further.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In this region we find the ionosphere, the aurora borealis and the ISS.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And the outermost layer is the exosphere, stretching up to 10,000 kilometers.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It merges fluently with outer space, where there's no atmosphere at all.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The atoms and molecules in this area are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with each other.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, humans in their present form have only been around for 200,000 years.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's 0.004% of Earth's history. Not long, really.

77
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And here we are now, living in a thin, moist layer on a small, wet rock.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We call this rock Earth.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is the product of the universe's deepest workings, the result of a constant process of creation and destruction,

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
happening all over the universe all the time, helped by chance, the laws of the universe and random events.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We are really lucky.
