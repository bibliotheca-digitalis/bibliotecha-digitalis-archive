0	4000	Electricity is all around us all the time.
4000	10000	It makes our lives easier, safer, more fun, and most of us never think about it.
10000	14000	But is there such a thing as too much electricity?
14000	20000	Could the thing that is the foundation of the modern world slowly be killing us?
20000	35000	Before we dive deeper, let's try to understand what electricity is and how it affects us.
35000	39000	Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.
39000	46000	This movement generates electric and magnetic fields that spread out through space and carry energy.
46000	50000	We call this phenomenon electromagnetic radiation.
50000	56000	Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous, but to radiate just means giving off.
56000	61000	Like when the radiator in your house gives off heat in the form of infrared radiation.
61000	66000	Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum correspond to different types of radiation,
66000	70000	and many of them are perfectly harmless.
70000	72000	Some of them can be dangerous though.
72000	77000	Radiation with very short wavelengths like UV light, x-rays, and gamma rays
77000	83000	are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms which can cause burns and genetic damage.
83000	88000	This is what many people have in mind when they hear the term radiation.
88000	96000	The rest of the spectrum covers a large range of longer waves from visible light, infrared, microwaves to radio waves.
97000	101000	This is the kind of radiation that's emitted by all sorts of human technology.
101000	107000	Mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, electric power lines, and household appliances.
107000	110000	This radiation doesn't disrupt molecules in our body.
110000	117000	However, some kinds of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves and can also make the hair on your body vibrate,
117000	121000	which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling above certain threshold values.
121000	124000	Other kinds are useful for making dinner.
124000	128000	Microwaves push the water molecules in your food around, which warms it up.
128000	130000	This happens to us all the time.
130000	138000	For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach is your skin heating up from exposure to electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.
138000	146000	We are surrounded by natural and generally harmless sources of electromagnetic radiation all the time, and always have been.
146000	152000	But since the industrial revolution, we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.
152000	161000	The question of whether this is actually dangerous first got public attention when a 1979 study linked leukemia to living near power lines.
161000	164000	This particular study was quickly discredited, though.
164000	169000	The connection could not be explained, and no direct causal link was confirmed.
169000	173000	But once this had been proposed, the idea persisted,
173000	179000	and the thousands of studies about possible dangers illustrate that it's still seen as a very real threat.
179000	185000	A lot of people claim to be sensitive to the radiation coming from our appliances and cell phones.
185000	191000	They report symptoms like headaches, nausea, skin reactions, burning eyes, or exhaustion.
191000	195000	But those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.
195000	198000	A few studies have found much more unsettling results,
198000	206000	like possible connections between the side of the brain which people use when they're on their phones and the appearance of brain tumors.
206000	211000	The question that science is trying to answer is not so much about the acute effects of irradiation.
211000	219000	We know, for example, that X-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells, but that the same doesn't happen with radio waves.
219000	231000	The question is rather, is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation we are constantly surrounded by harmful in the long run as a result of some as-yet unknown mechanism?
231000	234000	Answering this question was much harder than we first thought.
234000	240000	There are thousands of primary sources, reports, and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.
240000	245000	So we read a lot for this video. You can take a look at our research in the video description.
245000	252000	What we found is that this debate is a good example of how science should be communicated and how it shouldn't.
252000	258000	Many of the much cited studies that spread panic about electromagnetic radiation are highly controversial.
259000	264000	For example, a series of population studies based on surveys and self-reporting.
264000	271000	What this means is, for example, asking brain tumor patients how much they think they used their phone in the last few years.
271000	278000	The problem is that people are unreliable. We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.
278000	286000	On top of this, studies or media reports may be cherry-picking the findings that best suit their opinion or make for the most exciting headline.
286000	291000	For example, a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation.
291000	298000	The results seemed to show a connection, but for some reason only in male rats, and none at all in mice.
298000	304000	But it was reported as if this study did prove that mobile phone radiation causes cancer.
304000	310000	Unfortunately, this is the case for studies with both positive and negative findings on the issue.
310000	317000	Another aspect is that the WHO did officially classify radiofrequency fields as possibly carcinogenic.
317000	326000	But what this actually means is that there are some hints that they might cause cancer, but we can't prove it and that we will keep an eye out.
326000	330000	So, if we zoom out a bit, what's the big picture?
330000	339000	On the whole, there was no consistent evidence in human studies that electromagnetic radiation below exposure value limits causes health problems.
339000	344000	There are some statistical associations, but they're mostly weak and inconsistent.
344000	350000	If there were any definite cause-effect relations, we would know by now because of all the data we have.
350000	358000	So, based on the current state of science, should you worry about the radiation from your laptop or cell phone or TV?
358000	361000	The answer is no, you shouldn't.
361000	364000	But what about the people that say it is harming them?
364000	369000	Research showed they could be experiencing what's known as the nocebo effect.
369000	377000	If you have a headache and happen to start feeling better right when you switch off your laptop, you might see a connection between those two things.
377000	384000	Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone that weak radiation might harm you could be the very thing harming you.
384000	392000	It's easy to belittle these people. Most of them feel they're not being taken seriously, which makes the situation even worse for them.
392000	403000	They should get support, but it's important to be aware that, so far, we have no robust evidence that electricity below safety limits has any negative effect on humans.
403000	411000	In the attention economy we live in, talking about unproven dangers can make us neglect things that we know for sure are bad for us.
412000	413000	Just one example.
413000	422000	Outdoor air pollution is linked to 4.2 million premature deaths each year and is definitely something we could have a real impact on today.
422000	428000	Still, to make people feel safe and just to make sure, there are several long-term studies ongoing already.
428000	437000	For example, the COSMOS study that will look at the possible health impacts of cell phone use by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.
437000	444000	But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies, there are a lot more pressing problems to focus on.
