1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,480
When we think about alien civilizations, we tend to look into the vastness of space,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,800
to faraway planets. But, there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,920
giving too little thought to. Time. Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,080
other civilizations existed on Earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out,

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,600
and that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet?

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,320
What does science have to say about this, and what are the implications for us?

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,760
Life on Earth has existed for 4 billion years. Mostly as single-celled organisms,

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,560
until some 540 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion heralded the age of animals,

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,240
a huge time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would we look for them, and what could we

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,240
hope to find? Sadly, we have only one civilization to look at ourselves. Anatomically modern humans

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
emerged around 300,000 years ago, and probably lived in small groups of hunter-gatherers,

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,200
slowly spreading around the world. Progress was slow, and our lifestyle didn't change much,

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,040
although there may have been local bursts of complexity. Until about 10,000 years ago,

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,560
when the agricultural revolution changed our lifestyle forever, enabling massive population

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,080
growth and technological progress. Rather than just animals with culture and tools that would

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,440
have been invisible from space, we changed the face of the planet, cleared forests, and constructed

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,880
cities and temples for our gods, at breathtaking speeds and scales. Until about 300 years ago,

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,600
we became an industrial species, and yet again our numbers grew exponentially, as did our impact on

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,880
the planet. We could say that our 300,000-year-long history has three phases. We were hunter-gatherers

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:17,120
for 97%, farmers for 2.9%, and industrialists for 0.1% of our history. And yet, we are super new on

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Earth. On geological timescales, even the sturdiest things lose their durability. The oldest large-scale

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,440
surface is the Negev Desert, a meager 1.8 million years old. Everything older has been crushed to

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
dust or turned over, and it's either below the ground or covered by ice or ocean. Our age, the

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Anthropocene, will be a layer only a few centimeters thick in a few million years. If there were aliens

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,800
before us and they too went through these three phases, what would remain of them? What can we

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,600
learn about indigenous aliens by looking at ourselves? Hunter-gatherer aliens. We actually know

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,040
that in the last few million years there were hunter-gatherer aliens. Our ancestors, like Homo

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,080
erectus, and cousins like the Neanderthals or Denisovans, and probably many more that we haven't

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,800
found yet, are lost to time forever. They left fragments of their bodies, of weapons and tools,

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,400
and even art. Considering how long they existed and how little remains of them, although they

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
lived not that far from our present, it's easy to think there have been others. Intelligent animals

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,040
like us that could talk and use tools and fire that had culture and art. For the last two million

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,560
years, most hominins lived as hunter-gatherers. So if these aliens never moved up higher on the

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
tech tree, hundreds of different species and cultures could have existed without leaving any

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,880
traces. Their artifacts lost to biological and then geological processes. At worst, they would

36
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,320
leave absolutely nothing to be found after thousands of years. But what about fossils?

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,920
We talked about how unlikely the process of fossilization is in more detail in our dinosaur

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,000
video. But in a nutshell, per 100,000 years of Earth's history, we only get a handful of good

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,560
fossils. So we might easily just miss fossils of such people, but even if we had any, we wouldn't

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,120
necessarily be able to identify them as hunter-gatherers. Agricultural and empire aliens.

41
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,280
Looking at humans again, agricultural societies left much more to be dug up and found because

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,080
they used more sophisticated tools made from sturdier materials and had to feed millions,

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,000
leaving many more artifacts. Farming allowed them to specialize and develop tech from writing to

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,560
navigation, architecture, and government. Over thousands of years, city-states became kingdoms

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,880
and empires, some existing for millennia before they fell. Many of the buildings or monuments

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,480
they constructed are still around, and traces of them will exist for a few thousand more years,

47
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,480
some only as outlines in the ground but still recognizable to future archaeologists.

48
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
The pyramids are piles of limestone so massive that they will probably be around for hundreds

49
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,160
of thousands of years. And because of the greater numbers of humans that lived during our farm and

50
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
empire period, we can expect way more fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe for a few

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,200
million years before they vanish. So we can say with confidence that no such indigenous alien

52
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,320
civilization existed in the last few million years, because otherwise we would have found

53
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,920
something that they left. This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions of years,

54
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,680
back to the emergence of complex life where we wouldn't be able to tell.

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
If there were alien pre-industrial societies and empires on the level of the ancient Romans or

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,360
Chinese, they would have likely disappeared without a trace. Their tools, even advanced

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
metals, would have rotted away. If they dug up canals, cleared forests, and built cities,

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
their traces would be very hard to distinguish from nature. Maybe there was once an empire of

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,280
cephalopods occupying impressive cities in swamps and lakes made from wood and stone.

60
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities, their poets reciting poems in a language of

61
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,560
colors. Maybe they never industrialized. Maybe their society was too stable or not inventive

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
enough or they never got a chance. A single event like an asteroid, an epidemic, or an ice age,

63
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,920
could just have deleted their civilization, ground up their temples as their soft bodies

64
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,920
rotted away. Sadly, we don't have the tiniest amount of evidence for any such civilization.

65
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
After a few million years at best, their achievements would have dissolved into nothing.

66
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,360
Industrial indigenous aliens. What about industrial civilizations like humanity today?

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,320
Imagine humans died out suddenly through a pandemic or cosmic rays or something like that.

68
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
What would remain? Our impact on the planet is orders of magnitude greater than that of

69
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,160
our ancestors. The fossil record will show a great extinction of wildlife and an explosion

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,040
of fossils from human-associated animals like rats, cows, pigs, and chickens. Like the structures of

71
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,960
our ancestors, skyscrapers and streets and hard drives will basically crumble into nothingness

72
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
in a few millennia. But because there were so many humans everywhere, for a few million years after

73
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,640
our sudden end, there would be clear hints of our existence. The byproducts of our industrial

74
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,720
lifestyle might actually give us away for some hundreds of millions of years. We use massive

75
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,920
amounts of artificial fertilizer which redirects Earth's flow of nitrogen that is being deposited

76
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,400
in the soil. Mining metals and rare earth elements leaves long-term scars and depletes natural

77
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,320
resources. We saturate our oceans with plastics that find their way to the ocean floor and may

78
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,400
persist for hundreds of millions of years. There are radioactive elements and their decay, unnatural

79
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,640
accumulations of elements that don't exist outside labs or weapons. And of course, in our short

80
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,400
industrial history, we have changed the proportion of CO2 in the air by burning massive amounts of

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,200
fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the oceans, and so on. We may already have left a mark in the

82
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,960
geological record. So far we have found no traces of an industrial alien civilization. No layers of

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,800
weird chemicals or displaced elements. No radioactive layer to indicate that once great nations

84
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,040
waged nuclear war. We do see mass extinctions and massive shifts in the fossil records,

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,040
but no evidence that they did not occur naturally. And ironically, we've hit upon an interesting

86
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
problem here. If industrial societies stress the ecosystem enough to cause their own extinction,

87
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,880
they won't be around that long. But if they become sustainable, their imprint on the geological record

88
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,800
may be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were sustainable before they died out,

89
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,880
we may have little to no chance of ever knowing about them. In any case, over hundreds of millions

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,800
of years, these signatures may become very subtle and get overlooked or interpreted as natural.

91
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,960
Even if an industrialized alien society existed 200 million years ago and lasted for 100,000 years,

92
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,320
300 times longer than industrial humanity, it still might be easy to miss it in the geological

93
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,760
record. In any case, all of this is speculation. In the end, we shouldn't use our imagination to

94
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,040
trick ourselves into thinking we know anything about our blind spots. Just assuming a thing

95
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,840
happened because we don't have evidence against it is a trap we should avoid. So for now, if we look

96
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:01,040
at the vastness of time, it seems as devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe we are

97
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,000
alone in this universe and always were. Maybe we'll find traces of others eventually, we don't know.

98
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,960
But there is one important takeaway. The continuation of our civilization is not guaranteed.

99
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,760
And if we're not careful, we may disappear forever. Let's hope that in a few million years,

100
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,400
there isn't another civilization studying our layer in the fossil record.

101
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
It's frustrating to know there are so many things in our past we can't access.
