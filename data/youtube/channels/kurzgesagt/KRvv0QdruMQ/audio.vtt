00:00.640 --> 00:06.480
When we think about alien civilizations, we tend to look into the vastness of space,

00:06.480 --> 00:12.800
to faraway planets. But, there is another incredibly vast dimension that we might be

00:12.800 --> 00:19.920
giving too little thought to. Time. Could it be that over the last hundreds of millions of years,

00:19.920 --> 00:28.080
other civilizations existed on Earth? Indigenous technological species that rose and died out,

00:28.080 --> 00:31.600
and that they or their artifacts are buried beneath our feet?

00:32.560 --> 00:36.320
What does science have to say about this, and what are the implications for us?

00:46.240 --> 00:51.760
Life on Earth has existed for 4 billion years. Mostly as single-celled organisms,

00:51.760 --> 00:58.560
until some 540 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion heralded the age of animals,

00:58.560 --> 01:04.240
a huge time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would we look for them, and what could we

01:04.240 --> 01:12.240
hope to find? Sadly, we have only one civilization to look at ourselves. Anatomically modern humans

01:12.240 --> 01:17.280
emerged around 300,000 years ago, and probably lived in small groups of hunter-gatherers,

01:17.280 --> 01:23.200
slowly spreading around the world. Progress was slow, and our lifestyle didn't change much,

01:23.200 --> 01:29.040
although there may have been local bursts of complexity. Until about 10,000 years ago,

01:29.040 --> 01:34.560
when the agricultural revolution changed our lifestyle forever, enabling massive population

01:34.560 --> 01:40.080
growth and technological progress. Rather than just animals with culture and tools that would

01:40.080 --> 01:45.440
have been invisible from space, we changed the face of the planet, cleared forests, and constructed

01:45.440 --> 01:52.880
cities and temples for our gods, at breathtaking speeds and scales. Until about 300 years ago,

01:52.880 --> 01:59.600
we became an industrial species, and yet again our numbers grew exponentially, as did our impact on

01:59.600 --> 02:06.880
the planet. We could say that our 300,000-year-long history has three phases. We were hunter-gatherers

02:06.880 --> 02:17.120
for 97%, farmers for 2.9%, and industrialists for 0.1% of our history. And yet, we are super new on

02:17.120 --> 02:25.280
Earth. On geological timescales, even the sturdiest things lose their durability. The oldest large-scale

02:25.280 --> 02:31.440
surface is the Negev Desert, a meager 1.8 million years old. Everything older has been crushed to

02:31.440 --> 02:37.840
dust or turned over, and it's either below the ground or covered by ice or ocean. Our age, the

02:37.840 --> 02:44.800
Anthropocene, will be a layer only a few centimeters thick in a few million years. If there were aliens

02:44.800 --> 02:50.800
before us and they too went through these three phases, what would remain of them? What can we

02:50.800 --> 02:59.600
learn about indigenous aliens by looking at ourselves? Hunter-gatherer aliens. We actually know

02:59.600 --> 03:05.040
that in the last few million years there were hunter-gatherer aliens. Our ancestors, like Homo

03:05.040 --> 03:10.080
erectus, and cousins like the Neanderthals or Denisovans, and probably many more that we haven't

03:10.080 --> 03:16.800
found yet, are lost to time forever. They left fragments of their bodies, of weapons and tools,

03:16.800 --> 03:22.400
and even art. Considering how long they existed and how little remains of them, although they

03:22.400 --> 03:28.400
lived not that far from our present, it's easy to think there have been others. Intelligent animals

03:28.400 --> 03:35.040
like us that could talk and use tools and fire that had culture and art. For the last two million

03:35.040 --> 03:40.560
years, most hominins lived as hunter-gatherers. So if these aliens never moved up higher on the

03:40.560 --> 03:45.200
tech tree, hundreds of different species and cultures could have existed without leaving any

03:45.200 --> 03:52.880
traces. Their artifacts lost to biological and then geological processes. At worst, they would

03:52.880 --> 03:58.320
leave absolutely nothing to be found after thousands of years. But what about fossils?

03:58.880 --> 04:03.920
We talked about how unlikely the process of fossilization is in more detail in our dinosaur

04:03.920 --> 04:10.000
video. But in a nutshell, per 100,000 years of Earth's history, we only get a handful of good

04:10.000 --> 04:16.560
fossils. So we might easily just miss fossils of such people, but even if we had any, we wouldn't

04:16.560 --> 04:23.120
necessarily be able to identify them as hunter-gatherers. Agricultural and empire aliens.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.280
Looking at humans again, agricultural societies left much more to be dug up and found because

04:29.280 --> 04:34.080
they used more sophisticated tools made from sturdier materials and had to feed millions,

04:34.080 --> 04:40.000
leaving many more artifacts. Farming allowed them to specialize and develop tech from writing to

04:40.000 --> 04:46.560
navigation, architecture, and government. Over thousands of years, city-states became kingdoms

04:46.560 --> 04:52.880
and empires, some existing for millennia before they fell. Many of the buildings or monuments

04:52.880 --> 04:58.480
they constructed are still around, and traces of them will exist for a few thousand more years,

04:59.280 --> 05:04.480
some only as outlines in the ground but still recognizable to future archaeologists.

05:05.280 --> 05:10.320
The pyramids are piles of limestone so massive that they will probably be around for hundreds

05:10.320 --> 05:16.160
of thousands of years. And because of the greater numbers of humans that lived during our farm and

05:16.160 --> 05:21.520
empire period, we can expect way more fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe for a few

05:21.520 --> 05:27.200
million years before they vanish. So we can say with confidence that no such indigenous alien

05:27.200 --> 05:32.320
civilization existed in the last few million years, because otherwise we would have found

05:32.320 --> 05:37.920
something that they left. This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions of years,

05:37.920 --> 05:41.680
back to the emergence of complex life where we wouldn't be able to tell.

05:42.560 --> 05:47.600
If there were alien pre-industrial societies and empires on the level of the ancient Romans or

05:47.600 --> 05:53.360
Chinese, they would have likely disappeared without a trace. Their tools, even advanced

05:53.360 --> 05:58.800
metals, would have rotted away. If they dug up canals, cleared forests, and built cities,

05:58.800 --> 06:04.000
their traces would be very hard to distinguish from nature. Maybe there was once an empire of

06:04.000 --> 06:09.280
cephalopods occupying impressive cities in swamps and lakes made from wood and stone.

06:10.320 --> 06:16.320
Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities, their poets reciting poems in a language of

06:16.320 --> 06:22.560
colors. Maybe they never industrialized. Maybe their society was too stable or not inventive

06:22.560 --> 06:28.560
enough or they never got a chance. A single event like an asteroid, an epidemic, or an ice age,

06:28.560 --> 06:33.920
could just have deleted their civilization, ground up their temples as their soft bodies

06:33.920 --> 06:39.920
rotted away. Sadly, we don't have the tiniest amount of evidence for any such civilization.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.360
After a few million years at best, their achievements would have dissolved into nothing.

06:46.400 --> 06:53.360
Industrial indigenous aliens. What about industrial civilizations like humanity today?

06:54.080 --> 07:00.320
Imagine humans died out suddenly through a pandemic or cosmic rays or something like that.

07:01.120 --> 07:06.560
What would remain? Our impact on the planet is orders of magnitude greater than that of

07:06.560 --> 07:12.160
our ancestors. The fossil record will show a great extinction of wildlife and an explosion

07:12.160 --> 07:19.040
of fossils from human-associated animals like rats, cows, pigs, and chickens. Like the structures of

07:19.040 --> 07:24.960
our ancestors, skyscrapers and streets and hard drives will basically crumble into nothingness

07:24.960 --> 07:30.560
in a few millennia. But because there were so many humans everywhere, for a few million years after

07:30.560 --> 07:36.640
our sudden end, there would be clear hints of our existence. The byproducts of our industrial

07:36.640 --> 07:42.720
lifestyle might actually give us away for some hundreds of millions of years. We use massive

07:42.720 --> 07:47.920
amounts of artificial fertilizer which redirects Earth's flow of nitrogen that is being deposited

07:47.920 --> 07:54.400
in the soil. Mining metals and rare earth elements leaves long-term scars and depletes natural

07:54.400 --> 08:00.320
resources. We saturate our oceans with plastics that find their way to the ocean floor and may

08:00.320 --> 08:06.400
persist for hundreds of millions of years. There are radioactive elements and their decay, unnatural

08:06.400 --> 08:12.640
accumulations of elements that don't exist outside labs or weapons. And of course, in our short

08:12.640 --> 08:18.400
industrial history, we have changed the proportion of CO2 in the air by burning massive amounts of

08:18.400 --> 08:25.200
fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the oceans, and so on. We may already have left a mark in the

08:25.200 --> 08:32.960
geological record. So far we have found no traces of an industrial alien civilization. No layers of

08:32.960 --> 08:38.800
weird chemicals or displaced elements. No radioactive layer to indicate that once great nations

08:38.800 --> 08:45.040
waged nuclear war. We do see mass extinctions and massive shifts in the fossil records,

08:45.040 --> 08:51.040
but no evidence that they did not occur naturally. And ironically, we've hit upon an interesting

08:51.040 --> 08:56.800
problem here. If industrial societies stress the ecosystem enough to cause their own extinction,

08:56.800 --> 09:02.880
they won't be around that long. But if they become sustainable, their imprint on the geological record

09:02.880 --> 09:08.800
may be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were sustainable before they died out,

09:08.800 --> 09:14.880
we may have little to no chance of ever knowing about them. In any case, over hundreds of millions

09:14.880 --> 09:20.800
of years, these signatures may become very subtle and get overlooked or interpreted as natural.

09:21.600 --> 09:28.960
Even if an industrialized alien society existed 200 million years ago and lasted for 100,000 years,

09:28.960 --> 09:34.320
300 times longer than industrial humanity, it still might be easy to miss it in the geological

09:34.320 --> 09:41.760
record. In any case, all of this is speculation. In the end, we shouldn't use our imagination to

09:41.760 --> 09:47.040
trick ourselves into thinking we know anything about our blind spots. Just assuming a thing

09:47.040 --> 09:53.840
happened because we don't have evidence against it is a trap we should avoid. So for now, if we look

09:53.840 --> 10:01.040
at the vastness of time, it seems as devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe we are

10:01.040 --> 10:08.000
alone in this universe and always were. Maybe we'll find traces of others eventually, we don't know.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.960
But there is one important takeaway. The continuation of our civilization is not guaranteed.

10:14.960 --> 10:21.760
And if we're not careful, we may disappear forever. Let's hope that in a few million years,

10:21.760 --> 10:26.400
there isn't another civilization studying our layer in the fossil record.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.040
It's frustrating to know there are so many things in our past we can't access.
