What would happen to you if a black hole the size of a coin suddenly appeared near you?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.440
Short answer, you'd die.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.120
Long answer, it depends.

00:08.120 --> 00:11.880
Is it a black hole with the mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin?

00:11.880 --> 00:17.200
Suppose a US nickel with a mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.840
This black hole would have a radius of 10 to the power of minus 30 meters.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.520
By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about 10 to the power of minus 11 meters.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.680
So the black hole compared to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.200
Unimaginably small.

00:32.200 --> 00:37.600
And a small black hole would also have an unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.800
It would radiate away what little mass it has in 10 to the power of minus 23 seconds.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.560
Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy,

00:47.560 --> 00:53.880
which will lead to an explosion roughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.520
In this case, you'd die.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.360
You also lose the coin.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.440
If the black hole had the diameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably more massive.

01:02.440 --> 01:07.840
In fact, a black hole with the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more massive than the Earth.

01:07.840 --> 01:13.120
It would have a surface gravity a billion billion times greater than our planet currently does.

01:13.120 --> 01:18.600
Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they'd rip your individual cells apart.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.680
The black hole would consume you before you even realized what's happening.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.840
Although the laws of gravity are still the same,

01:24.840 --> 01:30.120
the phenomenon of gravity that you'd experience would be very different around such dense objects.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.200
The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire observable universe,

01:34.200 --> 01:37.680
with gravity getting weaker the farther away you are from something.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.440
On Earth right now, your head and your toes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet.

01:43.440 --> 01:48.680
But if you stood on a nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds of times closer to the center,

01:48.680 --> 01:55.920
and the gravitational force would be tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and rip you into a billion pieces.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.680
But the black hole wouldn't stop with just you.

01:58.680 --> 02:04.440
The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the Earth-Moon black hole of death system.

02:04.440 --> 02:10.440
You might think that the black hole would sink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out.

02:10.440 --> 02:16.440
In fact, the Earth also moves up onto the black hole and begins to bob around as if it were orbiting the black hole,

02:16.440 --> 02:21.480
all while having swathes of mass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy.

02:21.480 --> 02:28.760
As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a scattered disk of hot rock surrounding the black hole in a tight orbit.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.440
The black hole slowly doubles its mass by the time it's done feeding.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.240
The Moon's orbit is now highly elliptical.

02:35.240 --> 02:41.360
The effects on the solar system are awesome, in the biblical sense of awesome, which means terrifying.

02:41.360 --> 02:47.600
Tidal forces from the black hole would probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt,

02:47.600 --> 02:50.120
sending rocks careening through the solar system.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.560
Bombardment and impacts may become commonplace for the next few million years.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.760
The planets are slightly perturbed, but stay approximately in the same orbit.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.880
The black hole we used to call Earth will now continue on orbiting the Sun in the Earth's place.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.200
In this case, you also die.

03:06.200 --> 03:11.480

The topic is based on a question on the Ask Science subreddit,

03:17.400 --> 03:21.800
and the glorious answer by Matt Kaplan, who also worked with us on this video.
