00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
What would happen to you if a black hole the size of a coin suddenly appeared near you?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,440
Short answer, you'd die.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,120
Long answer, it depends.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,880
Is it a black hole with the mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,200
Suppose a US nickel with a mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,840
This black hole would have a radius of 10 to the power of minus 30 meters.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,520
By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about 10 to the power of minus 11 meters.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,680
So the black hole compared to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,200
Unimaginably small.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,600
And a small black hole would also have an unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,800
It would radiate away what little mass it has in 10 to the power of minus 23 seconds.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,560
Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy,

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,880
which will lead to an explosion roughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,520
In this case, you'd die.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
You also lose the coin.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,440
If the black hole had the diameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably more massive.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,840
In fact, a black hole with the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more massive than the Earth.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
It would have a surface gravity a billion billion times greater than our planet currently does.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,600
Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they'd rip your individual cells apart.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,680
The black hole would consume you before you even realized what's happening.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,840
Although the laws of gravity are still the same,

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,120
the phenomenon of gravity that you'd experience would be very different around such dense objects.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,200
The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire observable universe,

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,680
with gravity getting weaker the farther away you are from something.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,440
On Earth right now, your head and your toes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet.

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,680
But if you stood on a nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds of times closer to the center,

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,920
and the gravitational force would be tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and rip you into a billion pieces.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
But the black hole wouldn't stop with just you.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,440
The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the Earth-Moon black hole of death system.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,440
You might think that the black hole would sink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,440
In fact, the Earth also moves up onto the black hole and begins to bob around as if it were orbiting the black hole,

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,480
all while having swathes of mass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy.

33
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,760
As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a scattered disk of hot rock surrounding the black hole in a tight orbit.

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,440
The black hole slowly doubles its mass by the time it's done feeding.

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,240
The Moon's orbit is now highly elliptical.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,360
The effects on the solar system are awesome, in the biblical sense of awesome, which means terrifying.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,600
Tidal forces from the black hole would probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt,

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,120
sending rocks careening through the solar system.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,560
Bombardment and impacts may become commonplace for the next few million years.

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,760
The planets are slightly perturbed, but stay approximately in the same orbit.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,880
The black hole we used to call Earth will now continue on orbiting the Sun in the Earth's place.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,200
In this case, you also die.
