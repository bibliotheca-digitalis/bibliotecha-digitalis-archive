0	4800	What would happen to you if a black hole the size of a coin suddenly appeared near you?
4800	6440	Short answer, you'd die.
6440	8120	Long answer, it depends.
8120	11880	Is it a black hole with the mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin?
11880	17200	Suppose a US nickel with a mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole.
17200	20840	This black hole would have a radius of 10 to the power of minus 30 meters.
20840	25520	By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about 10 to the power of minus 11 meters.
25560	30680	So the black hole compared to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun.
30680	32200	Unimaginably small.
32200	37600	And a small black hole would also have an unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation.
37600	42800	It would radiate away what little mass it has in 10 to the power of minus 23 seconds.
42800	47560	Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy,
47560	53880	which will lead to an explosion roughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.
53880	55520	In this case, you'd die.
55520	57360	You also lose the coin.
57360	62440	If the black hole had the diameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably more massive.
62440	67840	In fact, a black hole with the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more massive than the Earth.
67840	73120	It would have a surface gravity a billion billion times greater than our planet currently does.
73120	78600	Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they'd rip your individual cells apart.
78600	82680	The black hole would consume you before you even realized what's happening.
82680	84840	Although the laws of gravity are still the same,
84840	90120	the phenomenon of gravity that you'd experience would be very different around such dense objects.
90120	94200	The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire observable universe,
94200	97680	with gravity getting weaker the farther away you are from something.
97680	103440	On Earth right now, your head and your toes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet.
103440	108680	But if you stood on a nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds of times closer to the center,
108680	115920	and the gravitational force would be tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and rip you into a billion pieces.
115920	118680	But the black hole wouldn't stop with just you.
118680	124440	The black hole is now a dominant gravitational piece of the Earth-Moon black hole of death system.
124440	130440	You might think that the black hole would sink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out.
130440	136440	In fact, the Earth also moves up onto the black hole and begins to bob around as if it were orbiting the black hole,
136440	141480	all while having swathes of mass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy.
141480	148760	As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a scattered disk of hot rock surrounding the black hole in a tight orbit.
148760	152440	The black hole slowly doubles its mass by the time it's done feeding.
152440	155240	The Moon's orbit is now highly elliptical.
155240	161360	The effects on the solar system are awesome, in the biblical sense of awesome, which means terrifying.
161360	167600	Tidal forces from the black hole would probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt,
167600	170120	sending rocks careening through the solar system.
170120	174560	Bombardment and impacts may become commonplace for the next few million years.
174560	178760	The planets are slightly perturbed, but stay approximately in the same orbit.
178760	183880	The black hole we used to call Earth will now continue on orbiting the Sun in the Earth's place.
183880	186200	In this case, you also die.
