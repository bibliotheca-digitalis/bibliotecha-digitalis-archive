00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The future of humanity seems insecure.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
and so many people think our end is in sight.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
But humans have always thought they lived in the end times.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Every generation assumes they're important enough to witness the apocalypse,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
and then life just goes on.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
This is a problem because it leads to short-term thinking

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
What makes this worse is that we may actually be living

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
at an extremely critical moment in human history.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
To understand why, let's look at the temporal window of humanity

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
and ask, when will the last human be born,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
and how many people will there ever be?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
These sorts of estimates come with a lot of uncertainties,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
so please take them with a gigantic grain of salt.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
To get a sense of how many people there will be,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
let's see how many people have already lived.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Modern humans arose some 200,000 years ago.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
They were uniquely good at making tools, telling stories,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
thinking abstractly, planning and working together in large groups

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
beyond their close family.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Still, there were not that many of us.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
Surpluses of food were scarce, survival was hard, life expectancy was low.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
It took us 150,000 years to grow to a population of 2 million.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Improvements were gradual and eventually led to the agricultural revolution,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
arguably the biggest change in our history.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
This was when our numbers really started growing.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It took 10,000 more years to get to 300 million.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
But that increase was dwarfed by the industrial revolution.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
In 1800, there were a billion of us.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
The human population doubled in just 120 years, and then again in 50.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Today, we number around 8 billion.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
In total, over the last 200,000 years,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
about 117 billion humans were born and lived,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
and 109 billion also died.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Which means that about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive right now.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
As many as were born in the first 150,000 years of human history.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Every minute, 270 babies join the party.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
But there aren't just more people.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Never before have we been as healthy and well-off or lived longer.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
With growing living standards, our birth rates collapsed.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
The UN estimates that around the year 2100,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
we will hit our population peak and there will be 125 million people born each year.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
It's pretty unlikely that birth rates will stay stable forever,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
but let's pretend to make our thought experiment simpler.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
How many people there will be in the future depends on when our species will die out.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And here, we find a lot of uncertainties.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
We are able to destroy ourselves through our own inventions,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
but we are also able to find solutions to avert catastrophic risk.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We can change the direction of planet killer asteroids,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
but we've also invented nuclear weapons.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
We discovered antibiotics, but also carry diseases across the globe in a matter of days.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Our industrial system gives us an incredible standard of living,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
but also change the atmosphere in the process.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
It's very hard to say if human ingenuity will prolong or shorten our species' lifespan.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
If things go badly, our end could come suddenly.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But if we manage to avoid that, we could conceivably stick around for a long time.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
So every day we don't destroy ourselves may mean life for an unfathomable number of humans.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
How many people are we talking about?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
It depends on how far our species is going to expand.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
If we stay on our home planet,

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
a good metric to look at is the extinction rate of animals that we get from the fossil record.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
The average lifespan of mammalian species is in the region of one million years,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
with some surviving up to ten million years.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Our close relative Homo erectus survived for about 1.9 million years.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Let's be conservative and assume that humans will survive for a million years,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
which leaves us 800,000 more years to dawdle away.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Assuming a stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
this means there are roughly 100 trillion humans waiting to be born.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
850 times greater than the number of people that have ever lived.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
This would make everybody alive today only 0.008% of all people that will ever live.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Think about where this leaves you.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Instead of putting you at the end of the chaotic mess that was our past,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
it would mean you live at the very beginning of something big.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
The start of the human story rather than the end.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Doesn't this feel incredibly different?

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
And now, consider that this may be an extremely pessimistic estimate.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
If we match the survival time of the most successful mammals,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
then our future numbers rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be born.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And even this seems far from our potential.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter,

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Earth will remain habitable for about 500 million years,

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
giving so many more potential people the chance to become actual people.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And now, let's begin to think big.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
We went from humans worshipping the moon to humans walking on it,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
so who knows how much further we can go.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
If we don't die out within the next few hundred years,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
ideas that seem outlandish right now become serious considerations.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
If we believe that we have a chance of surviving for maybe millions of years,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
then we could expand onto the other planets or into our own artificial worlds.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Life needs three things.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
A surface, resources, and energy.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Our sun provides energy for billions of years,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
and there is so much water and material floating in the asteroid and Kuiper belt

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
that we could sustain many times our current population.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Instead of living on planets, we could decide to construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
With resources and energy so abundant,

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
we could try out different types of society and ways of life.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
An interconnected civilization spanning the solar system

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
would create the basis of existence for an absurd number of individuals,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
orders of magnitude more than if we stick to Earth,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
even if we only existed for a few million years.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
This future doesn't have to be grim and dark as science fiction likes to paint it.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
With quadrillions of people waiting to be born,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
we will have billions of doctors working on curing cancer,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
billions of problem-solvers working on ending poverty,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
and billions of video game developers making life fun.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
More humans may actually mean more progress.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Another upside of leaving Earth and spreading out

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
is that it becomes much harder for us to become extinct

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
as you need a solar system-wide catastrophe to catch everybody.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
So aside from nearby supernovae or gamma-ray bursts,

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
humanity would be relatively safe from extinction, maybe for billions of years.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
If we manage to survive for that long,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
slow evolution or genetic engineering might split us into multiple species,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
or we might intentionally keep ourselves the same as we are now.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
So to account for that, we'll just talk about people from now on, instead of humans.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Okay, now let's think really big.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Scenario 3, people leave the solar system.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
As enormous as the solar system is,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
it is just one star system among billions in the Milky Way.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion stars,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
and live there for 10 billion years,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
with each generating 100 million births per year,

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
then we can expect something like a hundred octillion lives to be lived in the future.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
This is a one with 29 zeroes.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
A hundred thousand trillion trillion.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
We can spend this up as much as we like.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
The Andromeda galaxy will merge with the Milky Way, adding another trillion stars for us to settle.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Red dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion years,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
and future civilizations might even find energy for their habitats around black holes.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
A sufficiently advanced civilization of our descendants might even try to reach other galaxy groups.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
While these numbers are mind-blowing,

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
they may underestimate the number of unborn people by many orders of magnitude.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
If we divide the total energy available in a galaxy by the average energy needs of a single person,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
then we get a treedecillion potential lives.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
A million trillion trillion trillion potential people.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Conclusion.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Hopefully, what's become evident is that if we don't kill ourselves in the next few centuries or millennia,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
almost all humans that will ever exist will live in the future.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Which brings us back to us in the present.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
We exist at a high point in human history, with incredible possibilities at our grasp.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Technological, environmental, and societal.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
What we do matters for all the people who do not exist yet.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
So while it's not en vogue to think about humanity's long-term future with optimism,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
or to think about it at all, maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
If we screw up the present, so many people may never come to exist.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
the unborn are by far the largest group of people and the most disenfranchised.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Somebody who might be born in a thousand or even a million years

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
deeply depends on us today for their existence.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
This is why it's important to think about the distant future

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
and why our presence is so crucial, why it matters what we do today.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
One day, the last human will be born.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
We don't know when.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
But if we change our perspective from us living at the end of the human story

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
to us living at the very beginning,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
we can not only build a wonderful world for us and for them,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
but also for countless numbers of others.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Huge announcement.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
We're launching Kurzgesagt in six more languages.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
on top of our English, German, and Spanish channels,

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
bringing new perspectives and a love for science to as many people as possible,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
especially to some languages that are underserved

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
because it's not profitable to translate to.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
If enough people watch our new channels,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
we can hopefully run them for many years to come.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
This is where we need your help.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
It takes us a lot of time, effort, and, yes, money

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
to translate our videos properly and run so many channels.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
So, to make this sustainable, please help us spread the word.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
If you're native in one of these languages,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
share our videos on social media and tell your friends and family.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Make people in your native language aware that it exists.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
This multi-language expansion is supported by Open Philanthropy,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
an organization that tries to do as much good as possible.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
They want to help us spread awareness of science

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
and ideas for how you can help humanity thrive.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Their values align with ours in many fundamental ways,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
so we're going to work with them on more projects in the future.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
So, please help us spread the word, and thank you for watching.

12:01.000 --> 12:20.000
