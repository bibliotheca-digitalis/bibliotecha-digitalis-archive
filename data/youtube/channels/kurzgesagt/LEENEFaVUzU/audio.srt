1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The future of humanity seems insecure.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and so many people think our end is in sight.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But humans have always thought they lived in the end times.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Every generation assumes they're important enough to witness the apocalypse,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then life just goes on.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is a problem because it leads to short-term thinking

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What makes this worse is that we may actually be living

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
at an extremely critical moment in human history.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To understand why, let's look at the temporal window of humanity

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and ask, when will the last human be born,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and how many people will there ever be?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
These sorts of estimates come with a lot of uncertainties,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so please take them with a gigantic grain of salt.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To get a sense of how many people there will be,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
let's see how many people have already lived.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Modern humans arose some 200,000 years ago.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They were uniquely good at making tools, telling stories,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
thinking abstractly, planning and working together in large groups

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
beyond their close family.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Still, there were not that many of us.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Surpluses of food were scarce, survival was hard, life expectancy was low.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It took us 150,000 years to grow to a population of 2 million.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Improvements were gradual and eventually led to the agricultural revolution,

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
arguably the biggest change in our history.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This was when our numbers really started growing.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It took 10,000 more years to get to 300 million.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But that increase was dwarfed by the industrial revolution.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In 1800, there were a billion of us.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The human population doubled in just 120 years, and then again in 50.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Today, we number around 8 billion.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In total, over the last 200,000 years,

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
about 117 billion humans were born and lived,

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and 109 billion also died.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Which means that about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive right now.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As many as were born in the first 150,000 years of human history.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Every minute, 270 babies join the party.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But there aren't just more people.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Never before have we been as healthy and well-off or lived longer.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
With growing living standards, our birth rates collapsed.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The UN estimates that around the year 2100,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we will hit our population peak and there will be 125 million people born each year.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's pretty unlikely that birth rates will stay stable forever,

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but let's pretend to make our thought experiment simpler.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How many people there will be in the future depends on when our species will die out.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And here, we find a lot of uncertainties.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We are able to destroy ourselves through our own inventions,

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but we are also able to find solutions to avert catastrophic risk.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We can change the direction of planet killer asteroids,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
but we've also invented nuclear weapons.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We discovered antibiotics, but also carry diseases across the globe in a matter of days.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Our industrial system gives us an incredible standard of living,

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but also change the atmosphere in the process.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's very hard to say if human ingenuity will prolong or shorten our species' lifespan.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If things go badly, our end could come suddenly.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But if we manage to avoid that, we could conceivably stick around for a long time.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So every day we don't destroy ourselves may mean life for an unfathomable number of humans.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How many people are we talking about?

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It depends on how far our species is going to expand.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If we stay on our home planet,

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
a good metric to look at is the extinction rate of animals that we get from the fossil record.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The average lifespan of mammalian species is in the region of one million years,

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
with some surviving up to ten million years.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Our close relative Homo erectus survived for about 1.9 million years.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's be conservative and assume that humans will survive for a million years,

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
which leaves us 800,000 more years to dawdle away.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Assuming a stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
this means there are roughly 100 trillion humans waiting to be born.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
850 times greater than the number of people that have ever lived.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This would make everybody alive today only 0.008% of all people that will ever live.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Think about where this leaves you.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Instead of putting you at the end of the chaotic mess that was our past,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it would mean you live at the very beginning of something big.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The start of the human story rather than the end.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Doesn't this feel incredibly different?

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And now, consider that this may be an extremely pessimistic estimate.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If we match the survival time of the most successful mammals,

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
then our future numbers rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be born.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And even this seems far from our potential.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter,

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Earth will remain habitable for about 500 million years,

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
giving so many more potential people the chance to become actual people.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And now, let's begin to think big.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We went from humans worshipping the moon to humans walking on it,

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
so who knows how much further we can go.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If we don't die out within the next few hundred years,

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ideas that seem outlandish right now become serious considerations.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If we believe that we have a chance of surviving for maybe millions of years,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
then we could expand onto the other planets or into our own artificial worlds.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Life needs three things.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A surface, resources, and energy.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Our sun provides energy for billions of years,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and there is so much water and material floating in the asteroid and Kuiper belt

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that we could sustain many times our current population.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Instead of living on planets, we could decide to construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
With resources and energy so abundant,

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
we could try out different types of society and ways of life.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
An interconnected civilization spanning the solar system

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
would create the basis of existence for an absurd number of individuals,

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
orders of magnitude more than if we stick to Earth,

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
even if we only existed for a few million years.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This future doesn't have to be grim and dark as science fiction likes to paint it.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
With quadrillions of people waiting to be born,

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we will have billions of doctors working on curing cancer,

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
billions of problem-solvers working on ending poverty,

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and billions of video game developers making life fun.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
More humans may actually mean more progress.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Another upside of leaving Earth and spreading out

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is that it becomes much harder for us to become extinct

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
as you need a solar system-wide catastrophe to catch everybody.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So aside from nearby supernovae or gamma-ray bursts,

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
humanity would be relatively safe from extinction, maybe for billions of years.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If we manage to survive for that long,

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
slow evolution or genetic engineering might split us into multiple species,

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
or we might intentionally keep ourselves the same as we are now.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So to account for that, we'll just talk about people from now on, instead of humans.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, now let's think really big.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Scenario 3, people leave the solar system.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As enormous as the solar system is,

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
it is just one star system among billions in the Milky Way.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion stars,

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and live there for 10 billion years,

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
with each generating 100 million births per year,

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
then we can expect something like a hundred octillion lives to be lived in the future.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is a one with 29 zeroes.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A hundred thousand trillion trillion.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We can spend this up as much as we like.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The Andromeda galaxy will merge with the Milky Way, adding another trillion stars for us to settle.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Red dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion years,

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and future civilizations might even find energy for their habitats around black holes.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
A sufficiently advanced civilization of our descendants might even try to reach other galaxy groups.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
While these numbers are mind-blowing,

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
they may underestimate the number of unborn people by many orders of magnitude.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If we divide the total energy available in a galaxy by the average energy needs of a single person,

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
then we get a treedecillion potential lives.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
A million trillion trillion trillion potential people.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Conclusion.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hopefully, what's become evident is that if we don't kill ourselves in the next few centuries or millennia,

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
almost all humans that will ever exist will live in the future.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Which brings us back to us in the present.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We exist at a high point in human history, with incredible possibilities at our grasp.

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Technological, environmental, and societal.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What we do matters for all the people who do not exist yet.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So while it's not en vogue to think about humanity's long-term future with optimism,

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
or to think about it at all, maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If we screw up the present, so many people may never come to exist.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates,

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the unborn are by far the largest group of people and the most disenfranchised.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Somebody who might be born in a thousand or even a million years

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
deeply depends on us today for their existence.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is why it's important to think about the distant future

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and why our presence is so crucial, why it matters what we do today.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
One day, the last human will be born.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We don't know when.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But if we change our perspective from us living at the end of the human story

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to us living at the very beginning,

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
we can not only build a wonderful world for us and for them,

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but also for countless numbers of others.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Huge announcement.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're launching Kurzgesagt in six more languages.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean,

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
on top of our English, German, and Spanish channels,

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
bringing new perspectives and a love for science to as many people as possible,

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
especially to some languages that are underserved

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because it's not profitable to translate to.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If enough people watch our new channels,

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
we can hopefully run them for many years to come.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is where we need your help.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It takes us a lot of time, effort, and, yes, money

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to translate our videos properly and run so many channels.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So, to make this sustainable, please help us spread the word.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you're native in one of these languages,

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
share our videos on social media and tell your friends and family.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Make people in your native language aware that it exists.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This multi-language expansion is supported by Open Philanthropy,

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
an organization that tries to do as much good as possible.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They want to help us spread awareness of science

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and ideas for how you can help humanity thrive.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Their values align with ours in many fundamental ways,

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
so we're going to work with them on more projects in the future.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, please help us spread the word, and thank you for watching.
