0	3000	The future of humanity seems insecure.
3000	7000	Rapid climate change, political division, our greed and failings
7000	10000	make it hard to look at our species with a lot of optimism,
10000	13000	and so many people think our end is in sight.
13000	16000	But humans have always thought they lived in the end times.
16000	20000	Every generation assumes they're important enough to witness the apocalypse,
20000	22000	and then life just goes on.
22000	25000	This is a problem because it leads to short-term thinking
25000	30000	and prevents us from creating the best world for ourselves and our descendants.
30000	33000	What makes this worse is that we may actually be living
33000	36000	at an extremely critical moment in human history.
36000	41000	To understand why, let's look at the temporal window of humanity
41000	44000	and ask, when will the last human be born,
44000	47000	and how many people will there ever be?
55000	58000	These sorts of estimates come with a lot of uncertainties,
58000	61000	so please take them with a gigantic grain of salt.
61000	64000	To get a sense of how many people there will be,
64000	67000	let's see how many people have already lived.
67000	70000	Modern humans arose some 200,000 years ago.
70000	74000	They were uniquely good at making tools, telling stories,
74000	77000	thinking abstractly, planning and working together in large groups
77000	79000	beyond their close family.
79000	82000	Still, there were not that many of us.
82000	88000	Surpluses of food were scarce, survival was hard, life expectancy was low.
88000	93000	It took us 150,000 years to grow to a population of 2 million.
93000	98000	Improvements were gradual and eventually led to the agricultural revolution,
98000	101000	arguably the biggest change in our history.
101000	104000	This was when our numbers really started growing.
104000	107000	It took 10,000 more years to get to 300 million.
107000	111000	But that increase was dwarfed by the industrial revolution.
111000	114000	In 1800, there were a billion of us.
114000	120000	The human population doubled in just 120 years, and then again in 50.
120000	123000	Today, we number around 8 billion.
123000	126000	In total, over the last 200,000 years,
126000	129000	about 117 billion humans were born and lived,
129000	132000	and 109 billion also died.
132000	137000	Which means that about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive right now.
137000	142000	As many as were born in the first 150,000 years of human history.
142000	147000	Every minute, 270 babies join the party.
147000	149000	But there aren't just more people.
149000	153000	Never before have we been as healthy and well-off or lived longer.
153000	157000	With growing living standards, our birth rates collapsed.
157000	160000	The UN estimates that around the year 2100,
160000	166000	we will hit our population peak and there will be 125 million people born each year.
166000	169000	It's pretty unlikely that birth rates will stay stable forever,
169000	173000	but let's pretend to make our thought experiment simpler.
173000	178000	How many people there will be in the future depends on when our species will die out.
178000	181000	And here, we find a lot of uncertainties.
181000	184000	We are able to destroy ourselves through our own inventions,
184000	189000	but we are also able to find solutions to avert catastrophic risk.
189000	192000	We can change the direction of planet killer asteroids,
192000	194000	but we've also invented nuclear weapons.
194000	200000	We discovered antibiotics, but also carry diseases across the globe in a matter of days.
200000	203000	Our industrial system gives us an incredible standard of living,
203000	206000	but also change the atmosphere in the process.
206000	212000	It's very hard to say if human ingenuity will prolong or shorten our species' lifespan.
212000	215000	If things go badly, our end could come suddenly.
215000	220000	But if we manage to avoid that, we could conceivably stick around for a long time.
220000	226000	So every day we don't destroy ourselves may mean life for an unfathomable number of humans.
226000	229000	How many people are we talking about?
229000	233000	It depends on how far our species is going to expand.
238000	240000	If we stay on our home planet,
240000	245000	a good metric to look at is the extinction rate of animals that we get from the fossil record.
245000	249000	The average lifespan of mammalian species is in the region of one million years,
249000	252000	with some surviving up to ten million years.
252000	258000	Our close relative Homo erectus survived for about 1.9 million years.
258000	263000	Let's be conservative and assume that humans will survive for a million years,
263000	266000	which leaves us 800,000 more years to dawdle away.
266000	270000	Assuming a stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,
270000	274000	this means there are roughly 100 trillion humans waiting to be born.
275000	279000	850 times greater than the number of people that have ever lived.
279000	287000	This would make everybody alive today only 0.008% of all people that will ever live.
287000	289000	Think about where this leaves you.
289000	293000	Instead of putting you at the end of the chaotic mess that was our past,
293000	297000	it would mean you live at the very beginning of something big.
297000	301000	The start of the human story rather than the end.
301000	303000	Doesn't this feel incredibly different?
303000	308000	And now, consider that this may be an extremely pessimistic estimate.
308000	312000	If we match the survival time of the most successful mammals,
312000	317000	then our future numbers rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be born.
317000	320000	And even this seems far from our potential.
320000	323000	As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter,
323000	327000	Earth will remain habitable for about 500 million years,
327000	332000	giving so many more potential people the chance to become actual people.
333000	336000	And now, let's begin to think big.
341000	345000	We went from humans worshipping the moon to humans walking on it,
345000	347000	so who knows how much further we can go.
347000	350000	If we don't die out within the next few hundred years,
350000	355000	ideas that seem outlandish right now become serious considerations.
355000	360000	If we believe that we have a chance of surviving for maybe millions of years,
360000	365000	then we could expand onto the other planets or into our own artificial worlds.
365000	367000	Life needs three things.
367000	370000	A surface, resources, and energy.
370000	373000	Our sun provides energy for billions of years,
373000	377000	and there is so much water and material floating in the asteroid and Kuiper belt
377000	381000	that we could sustain many times our current population.
381000	387000	Instead of living on planets, we could decide to construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.
387000	389000	With resources and energy so abundant,
389000	393000	we could try out different types of society and ways of life.
393000	396000	An interconnected civilization spanning the solar system
396000	400000	would create the basis of existence for an absurd number of individuals,
400000	403000	orders of magnitude more than if we stick to Earth,
403000	406000	even if we only existed for a few million years.
406000	412000	This future doesn't have to be grim and dark as science fiction likes to paint it.
412000	414000	With quadrillions of people waiting to be born,
414000	418000	we will have billions of doctors working on curing cancer,
418000	421000	billions of problem-solvers working on ending poverty,
421000	424000	and billions of video game developers making life fun.
424000	429000	More humans may actually mean more progress.
429000	432000	Another upside of leaving Earth and spreading out
432000	435000	is that it becomes much harder for us to become extinct
435000	439000	as you need a solar system-wide catastrophe to catch everybody.
439000	443000	So aside from nearby supernovae or gamma-ray bursts,
443000	448000	humanity would be relatively safe from extinction, maybe for billions of years.
448000	451000	If we manage to survive for that long,
451000	455000	slow evolution or genetic engineering might split us into multiple species,
455000	459000	or we might intentionally keep ourselves the same as we are now.
459000	464000	So to account for that, we'll just talk about people from now on, instead of humans.
464000	468000	Okay, now let's think really big.
468000	472000	Scenario 3, people leave the solar system.
472000	474000	As enormous as the solar system is,
474000	478000	it is just one star system among billions in the Milky Way.
478000	482000	If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion stars,
482000	484000	and live there for 10 billion years,
484000	487000	with each generating 100 million births per year,
487000	492000	then we can expect something like a hundred octillion lives to be lived in the future.
492000	495000	This is a one with 29 zeroes.
495000	498000	A hundred thousand trillion trillion.
498000	501000	We can spend this up as much as we like.
501000	506000	The Andromeda galaxy will merge with the Milky Way, adding another trillion stars for us to settle.
506000	509000	Red dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion years,
509000	515000	and future civilizations might even find energy for their habitats around black holes.
515000	521000	A sufficiently advanced civilization of our descendants might even try to reach other galaxy groups.
521000	523000	While these numbers are mind-blowing,
523000	528000	they may underestimate the number of unborn people by many orders of magnitude.
528000	533000	If we divide the total energy available in a galaxy by the average energy needs of a single person,
533000	537000	then we get a treedecillion potential lives.
537000	542000	A million trillion trillion trillion potential people.
542000	543000	Conclusion.
543000	549000	Hopefully, what's become evident is that if we don't kill ourselves in the next few centuries or millennia,
549000	553000	almost all humans that will ever exist will live in the future.
553000	556000	Which brings us back to us in the present.
556000	562000	We exist at a high point in human history, with incredible possibilities at our grasp.
562000	566000	Technological, environmental, and societal.
566000	570000	What we do matters for all the people who do not exist yet.
570000	575000	So while it's not en vogue to think about humanity's long-term future with optimism,
575000	579000	or to think about it at all, maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.
579000	584000	If we screw up the present, so many people may never come to exist.
584000	588000	Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.
588000	591000	Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates,
591000	596000	the unborn are by far the largest group of people and the most disenfranchised.
596000	600000	Somebody who might be born in a thousand or even a million years
600000	603000	deeply depends on us today for their existence.
603000	607000	This is why it's important to think about the distant future
607000	612000	and why our presence is so crucial, why it matters what we do today.
612000	615000	One day, the last human will be born.
615000	616000	We don't know when.
616000	621000	But if we change our perspective from us living at the end of the human story
621000	623000	to us living at the very beginning,
623000	627000	we can not only build a wonderful world for us and for them,
627000	630000	but also for countless numbers of others.
632000	634000	Huge announcement.
634000	637000	We're launching Kurzgesagt in six more languages.
637000	643000	Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean,
643000	646000	on top of our English, German, and Spanish channels,
646000	651000	bringing new perspectives and a love for science to as many people as possible,
651000	654000	especially to some languages that are underserved
654000	656000	because it's not profitable to translate to.
656000	658000	If enough people watch our new channels,
658000	661000	we can hopefully run them for many years to come.
661000	664000	This is where we need your help.
664000	667000	It takes us a lot of time, effort, and, yes, money
667000	671000	to translate our videos properly and run so many channels.
671000	675000	So, to make this sustainable, please help us spread the word.
675000	677000	If you're native in one of these languages,
677000	681000	share our videos on social media and tell your friends and family.
681000	685000	Make people in your native language aware that it exists.
685000	688000	This multi-language expansion is supported by Open Philanthropy,
688000	691000	an organization that tries to do as much good as possible.
691000	694000	They want to help us spread awareness of science
694000	697000	and ideas for how you can help humanity thrive.
697000	701000	Their values align with ours in many fundamental ways,
701000	704000	so we're going to work with them on more projects in the future.
704000	708000	So, please help us spread the word, and thank you for watching.
