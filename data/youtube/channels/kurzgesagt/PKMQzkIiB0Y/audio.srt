1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Are you alone in the universe? Or are you connected to anything?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,520
First of all, you're part of a group of mammals that's still very young,

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,600
but we can make YouTube videos already and build large Hadron colliders.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
We've also split the atom and invented Pokemon.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,640
We stem from an ancient life form that began living about three and a half billion years ago.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,380
We feel like we're in control of this planet, but we aren't really.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,920
One little asteroid or one creative virus is already all it would take to kill us off for good.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,900
Humanity credits itself with being able to destroy the planet, but even with all our nuclear toys,

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,400
we would probably just cause a huge mass extinction at best.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,860
Maybe we could kill 90% of everything living on this planet. Big deal!

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
A few million years later, life would be back everywhere.

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,360
Most microscopic life and life below the surface wouldn't even be disturbed that much probably.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,220
On a geological timescale, our impact on Earth is kind of laughable.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
We're actually not that powerful.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,500
We live on this tiny wet rock that speeds through space following a massive ball of burning plasma.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,000
One day, this ball of plasma will stop burning and most likely kill us in the process.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,180
If we survive the death of the Sun and colonize the galaxy,

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,140
theoretically, we could survive until the last star in the universe goes out.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,780
After that, life becomes pretty impossible.

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,580
Okay, so everything has an end. Where does this leave you as an individual?

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,500
At one point in your life, for about half an hour,

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,840
you were only one single cell inside your mother's womb, a creature just 0.1 millimeters in diameter.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,800
Today, you consist of about 50 trillion cells.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,560
50 trillion incredibly complex little biological machines that are much bigger and more complex than the average bacteria.

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,440
They operate by the laws of physics and chemistry and use micro machines to build proteins, make energy usable, devour food,

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,660
transport resources, transmit information, or reproduce.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,160
They communicate, duplicate, commit suicide, fight off intruders, and fulfill super specialized duties for the greater good of keeping you alive,

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
so you can have babies.

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,620
But where is the you part in this, if you're made of trillions of little things?

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,860
The basic information for you is stored in the DNA,

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,360
a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living things.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
If you were to unravel it, it would be two meters long.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,740
If you combined all the little DNA strings in all your cells,

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,840
you'd get a string so long that it would stretch to Pluto and back to Earth. That's pretty long.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,560
And your DNA is a direct connection to your very first ancestor.

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Take a second to think about this.

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,440
In every cell of your body, there's a little string of stuff that's been there in various forms for 3.4 billion years.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,980
It evolved, it mutated, it duplicated trillions of times, but it directly connects you to the first living being on this planet.

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,620
We could say you touched every living being that came before you with your DNA.

40
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,680
But you are more than your DNA. Your body is made of seven octillion atoms.

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,540
That's seven billion, billion, billions.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Roughly 93% of the mass of the human body is made up of just three elements, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,720
Oxygen and hydrogen are predominantly found in water, which makes up about 60% of the body by weight.

44
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,860
Carbon is maybe the most important element for life.

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,920
It can easily bond with other atoms, which allows for the building of long, complex chains of molecules,

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,920
which make up the solid part of you. The remaining 7% is a tour of the periodic table of elements.

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,200
Nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron, fluorine, zinc, copper, iodine,

48
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,480
selenium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, lithium, strontium, aluminium, silicon, lead, vanadium, arsenic, and bromine.

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:17,380
By the way, this also means you're about 0.5% metal, no matter what your favorite music is.

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:26,380
Anyway, these elements perform various functions like enabling oxygen transport, building of bones and cell structures, carrying signals, driving chemical reactions,

51
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,800
and a lot more. Your body is in a constant state of transition.

52
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,340
Every 16 days,

53
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,360
75% of you has been replaced, because a healthy human exchanges about 100% of their water in that time period.

54
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,180
Each year, about

55
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,140
98% of your atoms are replaced by new ones, and

56
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,980
every five years, close to all of the atoms that make up your body weren't there five years ago.

57
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,100
So, you could call yourself a temporary collection of atoms.

58
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,180
But, where did these atoms come from?

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,680
In the beginning of the universe, there were mostly hydrogen and helium atoms.

60
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,660
Enormous gas clouds formed over millennia, and grew denser and denser, until they collapsed under their own gravity,

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,520
giving birth to the first stars. In the cores of these stars, hydrogen was converted into helium under extreme conditions.

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,980
After millions of years, the hydrogen became exhausted, and the stars began dying.

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,200
Under super extreme conditions, all elements we know today were created a fraction of a second before they died, and

64
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,440
exploded in supernovas. They shot most of their contents into space, while the cores collapsed and became black holes.

65
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,760
All these elements traveled through space for who knows how long, until they arrived at a different cloud that was slowly forming a new star,

66
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,360
our Sun. These elements that once were the insides of a star, formed planets and found their way onto Earth,

67
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
where they enabled life to begin.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,300
So, we are directly connected to the first stars ever born in the universe.

69
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,320
We are part of the universe. The idea of being a deeply connected minuscule part of an enormous structure is really mind-blowing.

70
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,460
We don't know what all this means, or if it means anything at all.

71
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,840
We know that we're made of little parts that connect us to everything in the universe, to the beginning of everything.

72
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,580
And this is kind of a nice thought. You are not alone. You never were. You never will be.
