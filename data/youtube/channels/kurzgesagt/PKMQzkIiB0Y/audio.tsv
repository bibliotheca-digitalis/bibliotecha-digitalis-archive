0	4220	Are you alone in the universe? Or are you connected to anything?
5000	8520	First of all, you're part of a group of mammals that's still very young,
8640	12600	but we can make YouTube videos already and build large Hadron colliders.
12800	15800	We've also split the atom and invented Pokemon.
15940	20640	We stem from an ancient life form that began living about three and a half billion years ago.
21140	24380	We feel like we're in control of this planet, but we aren't really.
25020	29920	One little asteroid or one creative virus is already all it would take to kill us off for good.
30780	35900	Humanity credits itself with being able to destroy the planet, but even with all our nuclear toys,
35940	39400	we would probably just cause a huge mass extinction at best.
40100	44860	Maybe we could kill 90% of everything living on this planet. Big deal!
45300	48400	A few million years later, life would be back everywhere.
49060	54360	Most microscopic life and life below the surface wouldn't even be disturbed that much probably.
54740	59220	On a geological timescale, our impact on Earth is kind of laughable.
59720	61720	We're actually not that powerful.
62280	67500	We live on this tiny wet rock that speeds through space following a massive ball of burning plasma.
67760	73000	One day, this ball of plasma will stop burning and most likely kill us in the process.
73260	77180	If we survive the death of the Sun and colonize the galaxy,
77600	81140	theoretically, we could survive until the last star in the universe goes out.
81420	83780	After that, life becomes pretty impossible.
84580	89580	Okay, so everything has an end. Where does this leave you as an individual?
96740	99500	At one point in your life, for about half an hour,
99500	105840	you were only one single cell inside your mother's womb, a creature just 0.1 millimeters in diameter.
106560	109800	Today, you consist of about 50 trillion cells.
110460	117560	50 trillion incredibly complex little biological machines that are much bigger and more complex than the average bacteria.
117840	124440	They operate by the laws of physics and chemistry and use micro machines to build proteins, make energy usable, devour food,
124600	127660	transport resources, transmit information, or reproduce.
127920	136160	They communicate, duplicate, commit suicide, fight off intruders, and fulfill super specialized duties for the greater good of keeping you alive,
136520	138520	so you can have babies.
138540	142620	But where is the you part in this, if you're made of trillions of little things?
143260	146860	The basic information for you is stored in the DNA,
147160	152360	a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living things.
152480	155920	If you were to unravel it, it would be two meters long.
156560	159740	If you combined all the little DNA strings in all your cells,
159800	165840	you'd get a string so long that it would stretch to Pluto and back to Earth. That's pretty long.
166720	171560	And your DNA is a direct connection to your very first ancestor.
171920	173920	Take a second to think about this.
174440	181440	In every cell of your body, there's a little string of stuff that's been there in various forms for 3.4 billion years.
181960	189980	It evolved, it mutated, it duplicated trillions of times, but it directly connects you to the first living being on this planet.
190420	195620	We could say you touched every living being that came before you with your DNA.
196720	202680	But you are more than your DNA. Your body is made of seven octillion atoms.
202960	206540	That's seven billion, billion, billions.
207560	214400	Roughly 93% of the mass of the human body is made up of just three elements, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.
215480	221720	Oxygen and hydrogen are predominantly found in water, which makes up about 60% of the body by weight.
222440	224860	Carbon is maybe the most important element for life.
225080	230920	It can easily bond with other atoms, which allows for the building of long, complex chains of molecules,
230920	236920	which make up the solid part of you. The remaining 7% is a tour of the periodic table of elements.
237880	243200	Nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron, fluorine, zinc, copper, iodine,
243560	249480	selenium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, lithium, strontium, aluminium, silicon, lead, vanadium, arsenic, and bromine.
249880	257380	By the way, this also means you're about 0.5% metal, no matter what your favorite music is.
257880	266380	Anyway, these elements perform various functions like enabling oxygen transport, building of bones and cell structures, carrying signals, driving chemical reactions,
266380	270800	and a lot more. Your body is in a constant state of transition.
271460	273340	Every 16 days,
273340	280360	75% of you has been replaced, because a healthy human exchanges about 100% of their water in that time period.
281180	283180	Each year, about
283460	286140	98% of your atoms are replaced by new ones, and
286420	291980	every five years, close to all of the atoms that make up your body weren't there five years ago.
292480	296100	So, you could call yourself a temporary collection of atoms.
296540	299180	But, where did these atoms come from?
299500	303680	In the beginning of the universe, there were mostly hydrogen and helium atoms.
304420	310660	Enormous gas clouds formed over millennia, and grew denser and denser, until they collapsed under their own gravity,
310960	318520	giving birth to the first stars. In the cores of these stars, hydrogen was converted into helium under extreme conditions.
319040	323980	After millions of years, the hydrogen became exhausted, and the stars began dying.
324720	331200	Under super extreme conditions, all elements we know today were created a fraction of a second before they died, and
331760	338440	exploded in supernovas. They shot most of their contents into space, while the cores collapsed and became black holes.
338860	345760	All these elements traveled through space for who knows how long, until they arrived at a different cloud that was slowly forming a new star,
345760	352360	our Sun. These elements that once were the insides of a star, formed planets and found their way onto Earth,
352920	354920	where they enabled life to begin.
355120	359300	So, we are directly connected to the first stars ever born in the universe.
359440	367320	We are part of the universe. The idea of being a deeply connected minuscule part of an enormous structure is really mind-blowing.
368300	372460	We don't know what all this means, or if it means anything at all.
372860	378840	We know that we're made of little parts that connect us to everything in the universe, to the beginning of everything.
378840	385580	And this is kind of a nice thought. You are not alone. You never were. You never will be.
