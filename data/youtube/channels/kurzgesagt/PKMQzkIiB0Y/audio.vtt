00:00.000 --> 00:04.220
Are you alone in the universe? Or are you connected to anything?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.520
First of all, you're part of a group of mammals that's still very young,

00:08.640 --> 00:12.600
but we can make YouTube videos already and build large Hadron colliders.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.800
We've also split the atom and invented Pokemon.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.640
We stem from an ancient life form that began living about three and a half billion years ago.

00:21.140 --> 00:24.380
We feel like we're in control of this planet, but we aren't really.

00:25.020 --> 00:29.920
One little asteroid or one creative virus is already all it would take to kill us off for good.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.900
Humanity credits itself with being able to destroy the planet, but even with all our nuclear toys,

00:35.940 --> 00:39.400
we would probably just cause a huge mass extinction at best.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.860
Maybe we could kill 90% of everything living on this planet. Big deal!

00:45.300 --> 00:48.400
A few million years later, life would be back everywhere.

00:49.060 --> 00:54.360
Most microscopic life and life below the surface wouldn't even be disturbed that much probably.

00:54.740 --> 00:59.220
On a geological timescale, our impact on Earth is kind of laughable.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.720
We're actually not that powerful.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.500
We live on this tiny wet rock that speeds through space following a massive ball of burning plasma.

01:07.760 --> 01:13.000
One day, this ball of plasma will stop burning and most likely kill us in the process.

01:13.260 --> 01:17.180
If we survive the death of the Sun and colonize the galaxy,

01:17.600 --> 01:21.140
theoretically, we could survive until the last star in the universe goes out.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.780
After that, life becomes pretty impossible.

01:24.580 --> 01:29.580
Okay, so everything has an end. Where does this leave you as an individual?

01:36.740 --> 01:39.500
At one point in your life, for about half an hour,

01:39.500 --> 01:45.840
you were only one single cell inside your mother's womb, a creature just 0.1 millimeters in diameter.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.800
Today, you consist of about 50 trillion cells.

01:50.460 --> 01:57.560
50 trillion incredibly complex little biological machines that are much bigger and more complex than the average bacteria.

01:57.840 --> 02:04.440
They operate by the laws of physics and chemistry and use micro machines to build proteins, make energy usable, devour food,

02:04.600 --> 02:07.660
transport resources, transmit information, or reproduce.

02:07.920 --> 02:16.160
They communicate, duplicate, commit suicide, fight off intruders, and fulfill super specialized duties for the greater good of keeping you alive,

02:16.520 --> 02:18.520
so you can have babies.

02:18.540 --> 02:22.620
But where is the you part in this, if you're made of trillions of little things?

02:23.260 --> 02:26.860
The basic information for you is stored in the DNA,

02:27.160 --> 02:32.360
a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living things.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.920
If you were to unravel it, it would be two meters long.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.740
If you combined all the little DNA strings in all your cells,

02:39.800 --> 02:45.840
you'd get a string so long that it would stretch to Pluto and back to Earth. That's pretty long.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.560
And your DNA is a direct connection to your very first ancestor.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.920
Take a second to think about this.

02:54.440 --> 03:01.440
In every cell of your body, there's a little string of stuff that's been there in various forms for 3.4 billion years.

03:01.960 --> 03:09.980
It evolved, it mutated, it duplicated trillions of times, but it directly connects you to the first living being on this planet.

03:10.420 --> 03:15.620
We could say you touched every living being that came before you with your DNA.

03:16.720 --> 03:22.680
But you are more than your DNA. Your body is made of seven octillion atoms.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.540
That's seven billion, billion, billions.

03:27.560 --> 03:34.400
Roughly 93% of the mass of the human body is made up of just three elements, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

03:35.480 --> 03:41.720
Oxygen and hydrogen are predominantly found in water, which makes up about 60% of the body by weight.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.860
Carbon is maybe the most important element for life.

03:45.080 --> 03:50.920
It can easily bond with other atoms, which allows for the building of long, complex chains of molecules,

03:50.920 --> 03:56.920
which make up the solid part of you. The remaining 7% is a tour of the periodic table of elements.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.200
Nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron, fluorine, zinc, copper, iodine,

04:03.560 --> 04:09.480
selenium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, lithium, strontium, aluminium, silicon, lead, vanadium, arsenic, and bromine.

04:09.880 --> 04:17.380
By the way, this also means you're about 0.5% metal, no matter what your favorite music is.

04:17.880 --> 04:26.380
Anyway, these elements perform various functions like enabling oxygen transport, building of bones and cell structures, carrying signals, driving chemical reactions,

04:26.380 --> 04:30.800
and a lot more. Your body is in a constant state of transition.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.340
Every 16 days,

04:33.340 --> 04:40.360
75% of you has been replaced, because a healthy human exchanges about 100% of their water in that time period.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.180
Each year, about

04:43.460 --> 04:46.140
98% of your atoms are replaced by new ones, and

04:46.420 --> 04:51.980
every five years, close to all of the atoms that make up your body weren't there five years ago.

04:52.480 --> 04:56.100
So, you could call yourself a temporary collection of atoms.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.180
But, where did these atoms come from?

04:59.500 --> 05:03.680
In the beginning of the universe, there were mostly hydrogen and helium atoms.

05:04.420 --> 05:10.660
Enormous gas clouds formed over millennia, and grew denser and denser, until they collapsed under their own gravity,

05:10.960 --> 05:18.520
giving birth to the first stars. In the cores of these stars, hydrogen was converted into helium under extreme conditions.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.980
After millions of years, the hydrogen became exhausted, and the stars began dying.

05:24.720 --> 05:31.200
Under super extreme conditions, all elements we know today were created a fraction of a second before they died, and

05:31.760 --> 05:38.440
exploded in supernovas. They shot most of their contents into space, while the cores collapsed and became black holes.

05:38.860 --> 05:45.760
All these elements traveled through space for who knows how long, until they arrived at a different cloud that was slowly forming a new star,

05:45.760 --> 05:52.360
our Sun. These elements that once were the insides of a star, formed planets and found their way onto Earth,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.920
where they enabled life to begin.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.300
So, we are directly connected to the first stars ever born in the universe.

05:59.440 --> 06:07.320
We are part of the universe. The idea of being a deeply connected minuscule part of an enormous structure is really mind-blowing.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.460
We don't know what all this means, or if it means anything at all.

06:12.860 --> 06:18.840
We know that we're made of little parts that connect us to everything in the universe, to the beginning of everything.

06:18.840 --> 06:25.580
And this is kind of a nice thought. You are not alone. You never were. You never will be.
