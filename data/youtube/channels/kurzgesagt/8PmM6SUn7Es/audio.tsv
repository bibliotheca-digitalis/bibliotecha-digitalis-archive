0	5000	Over the last few years, organic food has spread like wildfire.
5000	13000	Despite higher prices, buying organic is turning from an alternative into a moral and social responsibility.
13000	18000	Organic food is supposedly healthier, more natural, and more ethical.
18000	22000	But what do we even mean when we say organic?
22000	28000	There's no global consensus, so different regions have different definitions and rules.
28000	35000	In general, organic food is farmed without GMO seeds, synthetic fertilizers, or synthetic pesticides.
35000	41000	Instead, organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food like crop rotation
41000	45000	and use organic fertilizers such as compost or manure.
45000	49000	While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble,
49000	55000	is it actually effective or just another costly trend we can skip without feeling guilty?
58000	66000	Is organic food healthier?
66000	74000	One idea associated with organic crops is that their natural cultivation is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier.
74000	79000	Indeed, several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants.
79000	83000	Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide.
83000	89000	Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder, while regular plants have plenty of help from humans.
89000	96000	Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits, although scientists are still on the fence about them in general.
96000	104000	We have no idea if and how exactly they help us, or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount.
104000	107000	What about organic being more nutritious?
107000	110000	Well, the evidence is mixed.
110000	117000	Some studies found that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids,
117000	121000	while others did not find significant differences.
121000	127000	Overall, the mixed evidence suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value.
127000	134000	So, from the science available so far, it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits.
134000	141000	What we do know is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you, and most of us don't do that enough.
141000	147000	Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced.
147000	150000	Is organic food more natural?
150000	158000	People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins, but to avoid something toxic, artificial pesticides and fertilizers.
158000	165000	And indeed, several studies show that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce.
165000	168000	But here's where things get complicated.
168000	172000	Less pesticide does not mean none at all.
172000	178000	While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming, they're not forbidden.
178000	185000	Most organic pesticides are natural toxins like vegetable oils, potash soap, sulfur or copper sulfates,
185000	188000	but there are synthetic substances as well.
188000	192000	What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides?
192000	194000	Not a lot, actually.
194000	198000	Organic pesticides are not necessarily safer than conventional ones.
198000	204000	Toxic is toxic, no matter if the substance is manufactured or derived from nature.
204000	213000	In fact, in the case of copper sulfate, often used on organic apples, the organic pesticide of choice is actually more harmful to humans.
213000	221000	The toxicity of any substance depends on its concentration and your exposure to it, not if it's natural or not.
221000	228000	There are few recent studies about how our current level of pesticide exposure affects our long-term health.
228000	235000	A 2018 study from France associated never eating organic food with a higher risk of certain cancers.
235000	238000	The study was criticized a lot, though.
238000	245000	The participants reported their dietary habits themselves, while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done.
245000	255000	Complicating things even more, a Danish study from 2018 found that the danger from pesticides for an adult was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months.
255000	259000	The pesticides on your vegetables are nothing to lose sleep over.
259000	264000	Despite this, we should continue to demand strict standards for our food.
264000	270000	All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly in the EU and the US.
270000	274000	Every year, thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides.
274000	280000	The majority of samples have no residues or just a fraction of the tolerance level.
280000	285000	Right now, contamination from bacteria and fungi is much more dangerous.
285000	290000	And on this front, the risk is the same, be it organic or regular food.
291000	295000	Is organic food better for the environment?
295000	304000	In 2017, a meta-analysis looked at organic farming in detail and analyzed organic and regular foods from over 700 production sources
304000	310000	and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and land needs.
310000	315000	The result? No production method is clearly better for the environment.
315000	321000	Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones, but have similar greenhouse gas emissions.
321000	328000	Organic farms use less pesticide, but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop.
328000	333000	These mixed results were also confirmed by a report from the Swedish Food Agency.
333000	337000	Organic and regular were equal in most regards.
337000	342000	The biggest difference was land use, and here conventional farming clearly won,
342000	347000	and ecotoxicity, where organic farming has a clear advantage.
347000	355000	So according to these results, conventional farming actually has a little bit less impact on the environment compared to organic.
355000	361000	The bottom line is, organic food isn't superior to regular produce as far as we know.
361000	365000	But organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level.
365000	373000	Demand is rising constantly, and the struggle to supply the market can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways.
373000	381000	Spain, for example, grows tons of regular and organic vegetables destined for export in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy
381000	387000	and have other environmental impacts, such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions.
388000	395000	And because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production, the global trade in organic foods is also increasing.
395000	401000	As supply chains get more and more complex to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality,
401000	406000	ensuring organic quality standards and regulations gets ever more difficult.
406000	414000	This has led to incidences of fraud where conventional food was labeled and sold as expensive organic produce.
414000	419000	But organic versus conventional food isn't even an objective discussion.
419000	425000	Organic is not simply a production method, for many it's an ideology.
425000	428000	Buying organic feels right.
428000	433000	People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children and the well-being of the planet.
433000	442000	But our instinct to think of organic as good and conventional as bad can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision.
443000	448000	The solution could be to stop seeing organic and conventional farming as irreconcilable.
448000	456000	They both have pros and cons and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently would be a combination of their best features.
456000	463000	And as for your personal shopping, what food you should buy depends on what you expect from it.
463000	470000	If you simply want to eat healthily, you should buy more fruit and veggies of any kind, not necessarily organic.
470000	476000	If your concern is for the environment, then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you.
476000	481000	The easiest option is to buy local food that's in season.
481000	485000	Basically, seasonal is the true organic.
485000	493000	To sum up, an organic label is a manufacturing notice, not a security certificate or a silver bullet for your diet.
493000	498000	What you eat is much more important than how it's produced.
