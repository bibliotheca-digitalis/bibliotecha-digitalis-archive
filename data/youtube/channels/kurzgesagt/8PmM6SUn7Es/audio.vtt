00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Over the last few years, organic food has spread like wildfire.

00:05.000 --> 00:13.000
Despite higher prices, buying organic is turning from an alternative into a moral and social responsibility.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Organic food is supposedly healthier, more natural, and more ethical.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
But what do we even mean when we say organic?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
There's no global consensus, so different regions have different definitions and rules.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
In general, organic food is farmed without GMO seeds, synthetic fertilizers, or synthetic pesticides.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Instead, organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food like crop rotation

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
and use organic fertilizers such as compost or manure.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble,

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
is it actually effective or just another costly trend we can skip without feeling guilty?

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Is organic food healthier?

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
One idea associated with organic crops is that their natural cultivation is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Indeed, several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder, while regular plants have plenty of help from humans.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits, although scientists are still on the fence about them in general.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
We have no idea if and how exactly they help us, or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
What about organic being more nutritious?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, the evidence is mixed.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Some studies found that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
while others did not find significant differences.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Overall, the mixed evidence suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
So, from the science available so far, it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
What we do know is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you, and most of us don't do that enough.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Is organic food more natural?

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins, but to avoid something toxic, artificial pesticides and fertilizers.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
And indeed, several studies show that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But here's where things get complicated.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Less pesticide does not mean none at all.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming, they're not forbidden.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Most organic pesticides are natural toxins like vegetable oils, potash soap, sulfur or copper sulfates,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
but there are synthetic substances as well.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Not a lot, actually.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Organic pesticides are not necessarily safer than conventional ones.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Toxic is toxic, no matter if the substance is manufactured or derived from nature.

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
In fact, in the case of copper sulfate, often used on organic apples, the organic pesticide of choice is actually more harmful to humans.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
The toxicity of any substance depends on its concentration and your exposure to it, not if it's natural or not.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
There are few recent studies about how our current level of pesticide exposure affects our long-term health.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
A 2018 study from France associated never eating organic food with a higher risk of certain cancers.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
The study was criticized a lot, though.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
The participants reported their dietary habits themselves, while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done.

04:05.000 --> 04:15.000
Complicating things even more, a Danish study from 2018 found that the danger from pesticides for an adult was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
The pesticides on your vegetables are nothing to lose sleep over.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Despite this, we should continue to demand strict standards for our food.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly in the EU and the US.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Every year, thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
The majority of samples have no residues or just a fraction of the tolerance level.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Right now, contamination from bacteria and fungi is much more dangerous.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
And on this front, the risk is the same, be it organic or regular food.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Is organic food better for the environment?

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
In 2017, a meta-analysis looked at organic farming in detail and analyzed organic and regular foods from over 700 production sources

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and land needs.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
The result? No production method is clearly better for the environment.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones, but have similar greenhouse gas emissions.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Organic farms use less pesticide, but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
These mixed results were also confirmed by a report from the Swedish Food Agency.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Organic and regular were equal in most regards.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
The biggest difference was land use, and here conventional farming clearly won,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
and ecotoxicity, where organic farming has a clear advantage.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
So according to these results, conventional farming actually has a little bit less impact on the environment compared to organic.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
The bottom line is, organic food isn't superior to regular produce as far as we know.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
But organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
Demand is rising constantly, and the struggle to supply the market can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Spain, for example, grows tons of regular and organic vegetables destined for export in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
and have other environmental impacts, such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
And because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production, the global trade in organic foods is also increasing.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
As supply chains get more and more complex to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
ensuring organic quality standards and regulations gets ever more difficult.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
This has led to incidences of fraud where conventional food was labeled and sold as expensive organic produce.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
But organic versus conventional food isn't even an objective discussion.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
Organic is not simply a production method, for many it's an ideology.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Buying organic feels right.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children and the well-being of the planet.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
But our instinct to think of organic as good and conventional as bad can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The solution could be to stop seeing organic and conventional farming as irreconcilable.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
They both have pros and cons and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently would be a combination of their best features.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
And as for your personal shopping, what food you should buy depends on what you expect from it.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
If you simply want to eat healthily, you should buy more fruit and veggies of any kind, not necessarily organic.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
If your concern is for the environment, then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
The easiest option is to buy local food that's in season.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Basically, seasonal is the true organic.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
To sum up, an organic label is a manufacturing notice, not a security certificate or a silver bullet for your diet.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
What you eat is much more important than how it's produced.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
