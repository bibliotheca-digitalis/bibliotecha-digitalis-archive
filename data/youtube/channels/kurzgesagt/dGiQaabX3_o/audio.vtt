00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The world we live in feels normal, ordinary.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
But it's not.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Food, shelter, security, all of this is more or less taken for granted.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
But we're a special few.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
For more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
And there's no such thing as just one human history.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
Our story begins six million years ago, when the tribe of Hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
2.8 million years ago, the genus of Homo, the first humans, emerged.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
We like to think of ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
When we, Homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
there were at least six other human species around.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
kind of like living with aliens.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Some of them were very successful.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Homo erectus, for example, survived for two million years.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Ten times longer than modern humans have existed.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
We don't know what caused them to die out.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Modern humans have at least a few percent of Neanderthal and other human DNA,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
or because of a series of minor genocides.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Either way, only we remain.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Back to the beginnings of humanity.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools,

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
but did not make a lot of progress for nearly two million years.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Until they learned to control fire.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
which contributed to the development of our brain.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
and had cultures of their own.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But most importantly, they spoke to each other.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Probably in a kind of proto-language less complex than ours.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
There is much debate.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Anatomically modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago,

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviorally modern human.

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
At some point around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Tools and weapons became more sophisticated, and culture became more complex.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
Because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Unlike, for example, rigid beehives, or intimate but tiny wolf packs.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
As our brain evolved, we became able to do something life had been unable to do up to this point.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
One, expand knowledge quickly.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Two, preserve the knowledge gained over generations.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Three, build on past knowledge to gain even deeper insights.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.000
This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is, is hard.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
But while it's easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Their bodies compared to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
And they lived a rich social life within their tribe.

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
As a group, we know more today, but as individuals, our ancestors were superior to us.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
But then, around 12,000 years ago in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Everything changed very quickly.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields, from everybody.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
This meant that some of them could specialize.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Maybe they worked on better tools.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Maybe they started inventing things.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began.

06:17.000 --> 06:27.000
Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
First, early defense structures were built. The need for organization grew.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
Villages became cities. Cities became kingdoms. Kingdoms became empires.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
Connections between humans exploded, which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Progress became exponential.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
About 500 years ago, the scientific revolution began.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
Mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
The industrial revolution followed soon after, laying the foundation for the modern world.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Revolutions kept happening.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the internet shaped our world.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
500 generations ago, what we call civilization began.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
20 generations ago, we learned how to do science.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
And the internet became available to most people only one generation ago.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Today, we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We have transformed this planet.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
From the composition of its atmosphere, to large-scale changes in its landscape, and also in terms of the other animals in existence.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Some have even walked on our moon.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We put robots on other planets.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's leave it with that for now.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line, remember how special this made-up human world is.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay, this was our first take on making a history-related video.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
We'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
So we might do three or four a year. Your feedback's very welcome here.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Thank you so much for watching, and if you want to support us directly, you can do so on Patreon.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
It really helps us out.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
While you think about it, here are more videos if you need more distraction.
