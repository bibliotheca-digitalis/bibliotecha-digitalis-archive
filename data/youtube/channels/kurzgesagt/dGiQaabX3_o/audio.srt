1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The world we live in feels normal, ordinary.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But it's not.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Food, shelter, security, all of this is more or less taken for granted.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But we're a special few.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
For more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And there's no such thing as just one human history.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Our story begins six million years ago, when the tribe of Hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
2.8 million years ago, the genus of Homo, the first humans, emerged.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We like to think of ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When we, Homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago,

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
there were at least six other human species around.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
kind of like living with aliens.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Some of them were very successful.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Homo erectus, for example, survived for two million years.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ten times longer than modern humans have existed.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We don't know what caused them to die out.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Modern humans have at least a few percent of Neanderthal and other human DNA,

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
or because of a series of minor genocides.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Either way, only we remain.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Back to the beginnings of humanity.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
but did not make a lot of progress for nearly two million years.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Until they learned to control fire.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
which contributed to the development of our brain.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead,

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and had cultures of their own.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But most importantly, they spoke to each other.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Probably in a kind of proto-language less complex than ours.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies,

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There is much debate.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anatomically modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago,

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviorally modern human.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
At some point around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Tools and weapons became more sophisticated, and culture became more complex.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Unlike, for example, rigid beehives, or intimate but tiny wolf packs.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
As our brain evolved, we became able to do something life had been unable to do up to this point.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
One, expand knowledge quickly.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Two, preserve the knowledge gained over generations.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Three, build on past knowledge to gain even deeper insights.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is, is hard.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But while it's easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment,

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Their bodies compared to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And they lived a rich social life within their tribe.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
As a group, we know more today, but as individuals, our ancestors were superior to us.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But then, around 12,000 years ago in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Everything changed very quickly.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields, from everybody.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This meant that some of them could specialize.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Maybe they worked on better tools.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Maybe they started inventing things.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
First, early defense structures were built. The need for organization grew.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Villages became cities. Cities became kingdoms. Kingdoms became empires.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Connections between humans exploded, which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Progress became exponential.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
About 500 years ago, the scientific revolution began.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The industrial revolution followed soon after, laying the foundation for the modern world.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Revolutions kept happening.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the internet shaped our world.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
500 generations ago, what we call civilization began.

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
20 generations ago, we learned how to do science.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And the internet became available to most people only one generation ago.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Today, we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We have transformed this planet.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
From the composition of its atmosphere, to large-scale changes in its landscape, and also in terms of the other animals in existence.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Some have even walked on our moon.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We put robots on other planets.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us.

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand.

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's leave it with that for now.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line, remember how special this made-up human world is.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, this was our first take on making a history-related video.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So we might do three or four a year. Your feedback's very welcome here.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you so much for watching, and if you want to support us directly, you can do so on Patreon.

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It really helps us out.

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
While you think about it, here are more videos if you need more distraction.
