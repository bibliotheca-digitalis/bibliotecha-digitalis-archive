0	4000	The world we live in feels normal, ordinary.
4000	9000	It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed.
9000	11000	But it's not.
11000	18000	Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today,
18000	23000	giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival.
24000	29000	Food, shelter, security, all of this is more or less taken for granted.
29000	31000	But we're a special few.
31000	36000	For more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different.
36000	39000	And there's no such thing as just one human history.
49000	56000	Our story begins six million years ago, when the tribe of Hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended.
56000	62000	2.8 million years ago, the genus of Homo, the first humans, emerged.
62000	67000	We like to think of ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth.
67000	72000	When we, Homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago,
72000	76000	there were at least six other human species around.
76000	81000	Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary,
81000	84000	kind of like living with aliens.
84000	86000	Some of them were very successful.
86000	90000	Homo erectus, for example, survived for two million years.
90000	93000	Ten times longer than modern humans have existed.
93000	98000	The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago.
98000	101000	We don't know what caused them to die out.
101000	105000	Modern humans have at least a few percent of Neanderthal and other human DNA,
105000	110000	so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species.
110000	114000	So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources,
114000	116000	or because of a series of minor genocides.
116000	120000	Either way, only we remain.
120000	122000	Back to the beginnings of humanity.
122000	125000	2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools,
125000	129000	but did not make a lot of progress for nearly two million years.
129000	132000	Until they learned to control fire.
132000	136000	Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious,
136000	139000	which contributed to the development of our brain.
139000	144000	It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome.
144000	149000	On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting.
149000	155000	A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted.
155000	162000	From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies.
162000	167000	They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead,
167000	169000	and had cultures of their own.
169000	172000	But most importantly, they spoke to each other.
172000	176000	Probably in a kind of proto-language less complex than ours.
176000	182000	If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies,
182000	187000	and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different?
187000	189000	There is much debate.
189000	193000	Anatomically modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago,
193000	200000	but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviorally modern human.
200000	209000	Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities.
209000	214000	At some point around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation.
214000	219000	Tools and weapons became more sophisticated, and culture became more complex.
219000	228000	Because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail.
228000	235000	This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth.
235000	243000	Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups.
243000	248000	Unlike, for example, rigid beehives, or intimate but tiny wolf packs.
248000	254000	As our brain evolved, we became able to do something life had been unable to do up to this point.
254000	257000	One, expand knowledge quickly.
257000	261000	Two, preserve the knowledge gained over generations.
261000	266000	Three, build on past knowledge to gain even deeper insights.
266000	276000	This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient.
276000	282000	Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same.
282000	287000	There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many.
287000	291000	Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is, is hard.
291000	297000	But while it's easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant.
297000	300000	Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists.
300000	305000	They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment,
305000	310000	they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals.
310000	316000	They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills.
316000	321000	Their bodies compared to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines.
321000	324000	And they lived a rich social life within their tribe.
325000	333000	Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today.
333000	339000	As a group, we know more today, but as individuals, our ancestors were superior to us.
339000	345000	But then, around 12,000 years ago in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture.
345000	347000	Everything changed very quickly.
347000	354000	Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields, from everybody.
354000	361000	With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival.
361000	364000	This meant that some of them could specialize.
364000	366000	Maybe they worked on better tools.
366000	370000	Maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock.
370000	372000	Maybe they started inventing things.
373000	377000	As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began.
377000	387000	Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat.
387000	392000	The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces.
392000	397000	First, early defense structures were built. The need for organization grew.
397000	401000	The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient.
401000	407000	Villages became cities. Cities became kingdoms. Kingdoms became empires.
408000	414000	Connections between humans exploded, which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge.
414000	416000	Progress became exponential.
416000	420000	About 500 years ago, the scientific revolution began.
420000	427000	Mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew.
427000	433000	The industrial revolution followed soon after, laying the foundation for the modern world.
433000	440000	As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity.
440000	442000	Revolutions kept happening.
442000	450000	The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the internet shaped our world.
450000	453000	It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened.
453000	459000	It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species.
459000	465000	About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day.
465000	469000	500 generations ago, what we call civilization began.
469000	473000	20 generations ago, we learned how to do science.
473000	478000	And the internet became available to most people only one generation ago.
478000	482000	Today, we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced.
482000	484000	We have transformed this planet.
484000	492000	From the composition of its atmosphere, to large-scale changes in its landscape, and also in terms of the other animals in existence.
492000	497000	We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky.
497000	499000	Some have even walked on our moon.
499000	501000	We put robots on other planets.
501000	505000	We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes.
505000	510000	Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded.
510000	515000	The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago.
515000	520000	Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile.
520000	525000	We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago.
525000	531000	But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history.
531000	535000	From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us.
536000	543000	We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand.
543000	545000	Let's leave it with that for now.
545000	552000	The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line, remember how special this made-up human world is.
552000	556000	Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things.
556000	560000	Okay, this was our first take on making a history-related video.
560000	564000	We'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video.
564000	568000	So we might do three or four a year. Your feedback's very welcome here.
568000	573000	Thank you so much for watching, and if you want to support us directly, you can do so on Patreon.
573000	574000	It really helps us out.
574000	578000	While you think about it, here are more videos if you need more distraction.
