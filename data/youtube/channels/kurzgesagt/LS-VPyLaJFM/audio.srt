1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
One day, the last star will die, and the universe will turn dark forever.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,100
It will probably be a red dwarf, a tiny kind of star that's also one of our best bets to

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,320
find alien life and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,120
So what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,520
At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there,

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,800
with only about 7-50% of the mass of our Sun, not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter,

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,480
which is still huge though. They are also very dim. It's impossible to see them with the naked eye.

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,000
You've never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clearly

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,960
observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood. Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,240
Earth are red dwarfs. Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,760
stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores, red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,040
the helium and hydrogen constantly mix. So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly before they're

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,600
extinguished. Red dwarfs burn so slowly that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,360
years. By comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years. Because the universe is

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,960
only 13.75 billion years old, not a single red dwarf has reached later development stages. Every

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,280
single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star in

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,680
the entire universe is also a red dwarf, because small red dwarfs are right on the verge of being

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,560
a star at all. Just a tiny bit less hydrogen, and they are mere brown dwarfs. Failed stars that

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,080
cannot sustain a fusion reaction for long. So what about aliens, or a new home for humanity?

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,400
Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for a new home. And where there are

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,840
habitable planets, there might also be aliens. The Kepler Space Observatory found that at least half

22
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,200
of all red dwarfs host rock planets between half and four times the mass of our Earth. Many of them

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,600
are in the habitable zone, the area around a star where water can be liquid. But since red dwarfs

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,120
burn at relatively cold temperatures, a planet would need to be really close to be hospitable,

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,320
probably as close as Mercury to our Sun, or even closer. Which brings with it all kinds of problems.

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,720
For example, a planet this close to a star would probably be tidally locked, meaning the same side

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,960
would always face it. This side would be incredibly hot, while the shadow side would be frozen,

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,240
which makes it hard for life to develop. Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,840
distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitational forces of the

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,000
red dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much that it might lose all its water over time.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,800
These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell. Another problem is that many red

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,000
dwarfs vary in their energy output. They can be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,600
light by up to 40% for months, which would cause oceans on planets to freeze over. At other times,

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,400
they can emit powerful solar flares, sudden outbursts of energy, incredibly powerful.

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,760
These red dwarfs can double their brightness in minutes, which could strip away sizable

36
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,880
portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering it sterile. On the other hand,

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,640
their extremely long lifespan is a big plus. A red dwarf with just moderate levels of activity

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,800
could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life. Life on Earth has existed for about 4

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,080
billion years, and we have about a billion years left before the sun becomes so hot that complex

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,240
life on Earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,680
home. We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years around a red dwarf with the

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,600
right conditions. About 5% of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way may host habitable, roughly

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Earth-sized planets. That would be more than 4 billion in total. But life may not even need a

44
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,040
planet like Earth. Candidates for life around a red dwarf may be the moons of gas giants,

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,440
also called super-Earths, really massive, rocky planets. All in all, there are an estimated 60

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,080
billion potentially habitable planets around red dwarfs. And that's in the Milky Way alone.

47
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,240
So red dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future. But everything has

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,360
to die at some point, even red dwarfs. When in trillions of years the life of the last red dwarf

49
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,400
in the universe is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event. As its hydrogen runs out,

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,160
it shrinks, becoming a blue dwarf burning out completely. After its fuel is spent,

51
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,440
it's transformed into a white dwarf, an object about as small as Earth, packed very densely and

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,200
made of degenerate gases, mostly of helium-4 nuclei. Having no more source of energy,

53
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,560
it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years until it becomes its final form,

54
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,280
a cold black dwarf. White and black dwarfs are so fascinating that they deserve their own video.

55
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,800
Anyway, it's going to be a long time before the last stars in the universe vanish. It's kind of

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
uplifting to know that if humanity succeeds in venturing into space, we have plenty of time

57
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,680
before the universe turns out the lights. Our videos are made thanks to your support
