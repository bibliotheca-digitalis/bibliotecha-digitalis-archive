00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
One day, the last star will die, and the universe will turn dark forever.

00:06.760 --> 00:12.100
It will probably be a red dwarf, a tiny kind of star that's also one of our best bets to

00:12.100 --> 00:18.320
find alien life and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.120
So what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?

00:30.000 --> 00:37.520
At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there,

00:37.520 --> 00:43.800
with only about 7-50% of the mass of our Sun, not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter,

00:43.800 --> 00:50.480
which is still huge though. They are also very dim. It's impossible to see them with the naked eye.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.000
You've never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clearly

00:56.000 --> 01:00.960
observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood. Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to

01:00.960 --> 01:08.240
Earth are red dwarfs. Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive

01:08.240 --> 01:13.760
stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores, red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that

01:13.760 --> 01:20.040
the helium and hydrogen constantly mix. So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly before they're

01:20.040 --> 01:26.600
extinguished. Red dwarfs burn so slowly that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion

01:26.600 --> 01:33.360
years. By comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years. Because the universe is

01:33.360 --> 01:39.960
only 13.75 billion years old, not a single red dwarf has reached later development stages. Every

01:39.960 --> 01:46.280
single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star in

01:46.280 --> 01:51.680
the entire universe is also a red dwarf, because small red dwarfs are right on the verge of being

01:51.680 --> 01:57.560
a star at all. Just a tiny bit less hydrogen, and they are mere brown dwarfs. Failed stars that

01:57.560 --> 02:04.080
cannot sustain a fusion reaction for long. So what about aliens, or a new home for humanity?

02:04.080 --> 02:10.400
Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for a new home. And where there are

02:10.560 --> 02:16.840
habitable planets, there might also be aliens. The Kepler Space Observatory found that at least half

02:16.840 --> 02:23.200
of all red dwarfs host rock planets between half and four times the mass of our Earth. Many of them

02:23.200 --> 02:29.600
are in the habitable zone, the area around a star where water can be liquid. But since red dwarfs

02:29.600 --> 02:34.120
burn at relatively cold temperatures, a planet would need to be really close to be hospitable,

02:34.120 --> 02:41.320
probably as close as Mercury to our Sun, or even closer. Which brings with it all kinds of problems.

02:41.320 --> 02:46.720
For example, a planet this close to a star would probably be tidally locked, meaning the same side

02:46.720 --> 02:51.960
would always face it. This side would be incredibly hot, while the shadow side would be frozen,

02:51.960 --> 02:58.240
which makes it hard for life to develop. Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to

02:58.240 --> 03:04.840
distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitational forces of the

03:04.840 --> 03:10.000
red dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much that it might lose all its water over time.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.800
These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell. Another problem is that many red

03:16.800 --> 03:22.000
dwarfs vary in their energy output. They can be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted

03:22.000 --> 03:27.600
light by up to 40% for months, which would cause oceans on planets to freeze over. At other times,

03:27.640 --> 03:32.400
they can emit powerful solar flares, sudden outbursts of energy, incredibly powerful.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.760
These red dwarfs can double their brightness in minutes, which could strip away sizable

03:36.760 --> 03:41.880
portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering it sterile. On the other hand,

03:41.880 --> 03:47.640
their extremely long lifespan is a big plus. A red dwarf with just moderate levels of activity

03:47.640 --> 03:53.800
could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life. Life on Earth has existed for about 4

03:53.840 --> 03:59.080
billion years, and we have about a billion years left before the sun becomes so hot that complex

03:59.080 --> 04:04.240
life on Earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new

04:04.240 --> 04:09.680
home. We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years around a red dwarf with the

04:09.680 --> 04:15.600
right conditions. About 5% of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way may host habitable, roughly

04:15.600 --> 04:22.200
Earth-sized planets. That would be more than 4 billion in total. But life may not even need a

04:22.200 --> 04:27.040
planet like Earth. Candidates for life around a red dwarf may be the moons of gas giants,

04:27.040 --> 04:33.440
also called super-Earths, really massive, rocky planets. All in all, there are an estimated 60

04:33.440 --> 04:39.080
billion potentially habitable planets around red dwarfs. And that's in the Milky Way alone.

04:39.080 --> 04:45.240
So red dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future. But everything has

04:45.240 --> 04:51.360
to die at some point, even red dwarfs. When in trillions of years the life of the last red dwarf

04:51.400 --> 04:57.400
in the universe is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event. As its hydrogen runs out,

04:57.400 --> 05:02.160
it shrinks, becoming a blue dwarf burning out completely. After its fuel is spent,

05:02.160 --> 05:07.440
it's transformed into a white dwarf, an object about as small as Earth, packed very densely and

05:07.440 --> 05:13.200
made of degenerate gases, mostly of helium-4 nuclei. Having no more source of energy,

05:13.200 --> 05:18.560
it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years until it becomes its final form,

05:18.560 --> 05:24.280
a cold black dwarf. White and black dwarfs are so fascinating that they deserve their own video.

05:24.280 --> 05:29.800
Anyway, it's going to be a long time before the last stars in the universe vanish. It's kind of

05:29.800 --> 05:34.800
uplifting to know that if humanity succeeds in venturing into space, we have plenty of time

05:34.800 --> 05:40.680
before the universe turns out the lights. Our videos are made thanks to your support
