0	6760	One day, the last star will die, and the universe will turn dark forever.
6760	12100	It will probably be a red dwarf, a tiny kind of star that's also one of our best bets to
12100	18320	find alien life and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.
18320	22120	So what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope?
30000	37520	At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there,
37520	43800	with only about 7-50% of the mass of our Sun, not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter,
43800	50480	which is still huge though. They are also very dim. It's impossible to see them with the naked eye.
50480	56000	You've never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clearly
56000	60960	observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood. Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to
60960	68240	Earth are red dwarfs. Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive
68240	73760	stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores, red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that
73760	80040	the helium and hydrogen constantly mix. So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly before they're
80040	86600	extinguished. Red dwarfs burn so slowly that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion
86600	93360	years. By comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years. Because the universe is
93360	99960	only 13.75 billion years old, not a single red dwarf has reached later development stages. Every
99960	106280	single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star in
106280	111680	the entire universe is also a red dwarf, because small red dwarfs are right on the verge of being
111680	117560	a star at all. Just a tiny bit less hydrogen, and they are mere brown dwarfs. Failed stars that
117560	124080	cannot sustain a fusion reaction for long. So what about aliens, or a new home for humanity?
124080	130400	Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for a new home. And where there are
130560	136840	habitable planets, there might also be aliens. The Kepler Space Observatory found that at least half
136840	143200	of all red dwarfs host rock planets between half and four times the mass of our Earth. Many of them
143200	149600	are in the habitable zone, the area around a star where water can be liquid. But since red dwarfs
149600	154120	burn at relatively cold temperatures, a planet would need to be really close to be hospitable,
154120	161320	probably as close as Mercury to our Sun, or even closer. Which brings with it all kinds of problems.
161320	166720	For example, a planet this close to a star would probably be tidally locked, meaning the same side
166720	171960	would always face it. This side would be incredibly hot, while the shadow side would be frozen,
171960	178240	which makes it hard for life to develop. Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to
178240	184840	distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitational forces of the
184840	190000	red dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much that it might lose all its water over time.
190000	196800	These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell. Another problem is that many red
196800	202000	dwarfs vary in their energy output. They can be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted
202000	207600	light by up to 40% for months, which would cause oceans on planets to freeze over. At other times,
207640	212400	they can emit powerful solar flares, sudden outbursts of energy, incredibly powerful.
212400	216760	These red dwarfs can double their brightness in minutes, which could strip away sizable
216760	221880	portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering it sterile. On the other hand,
221880	227640	their extremely long lifespan is a big plus. A red dwarf with just moderate levels of activity
227640	233800	could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life. Life on Earth has existed for about 4
233840	239080	billion years, and we have about a billion years left before the sun becomes so hot that complex
239080	244240	life on Earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new
244240	249680	home. We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years around a red dwarf with the
249680	255600	right conditions. About 5% of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way may host habitable, roughly
255600	262200	Earth-sized planets. That would be more than 4 billion in total. But life may not even need a
262200	267040	planet like Earth. Candidates for life around a red dwarf may be the moons of gas giants,
267040	273440	also called super-Earths, really massive, rocky planets. All in all, there are an estimated 60
273440	279080	billion potentially habitable planets around red dwarfs. And that's in the Milky Way alone.
279080	285240	So red dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future. But everything has
285240	291360	to die at some point, even red dwarfs. When in trillions of years the life of the last red dwarf
291400	297400	in the universe is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event. As its hydrogen runs out,
297400	302160	it shrinks, becoming a blue dwarf burning out completely. After its fuel is spent,
302160	307440	it's transformed into a white dwarf, an object about as small as Earth, packed very densely and
307440	313200	made of degenerate gases, mostly of helium-4 nuclei. Having no more source of energy,
313200	318560	it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years until it becomes its final form,
318560	324280	a cold black dwarf. White and black dwarfs are so fascinating that they deserve their own video.
324280	329800	Anyway, it's going to be a long time before the last stars in the universe vanish. It's kind of
329800	334800	uplifting to know that if humanity succeeds in venturing into space, we have plenty of time
334800	340680	before the universe turns out the lights. Our videos are made thanks to your support
