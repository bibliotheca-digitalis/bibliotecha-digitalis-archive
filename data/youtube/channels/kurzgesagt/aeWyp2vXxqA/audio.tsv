480	4320	Black hole stars may have been the largest stars that ever existed.
5120	10960	They burned brighter than galaxies and were larger than any star today or that could ever exist in
10960	17520	the future. But besides their scale, what makes them special and weird is that deep inside,
17520	24080	they were occupied by a cosmic parasite, an endlessly hungry black hole. How is that even
24080	38880	possible? Black hole stars take the weirdness of black holes and go beyond to break everything we
38880	44480	know about how stars form and grow. They were only possible during a short window of time
44480	49360	in the early universe, but if they existed, they would solve one of the largest mysteries
49360	56720	of cosmology. Black hole stars were excessive any way you look at them. The most massive stars today
56720	63600	may have about 300 solar masses. A black hole star had up to 10 million solar masses of nearly
63600	70960	pure hydrogen. Let's take a moment to look at what this means visually. The Sun, Wesson,
70960	79280	L.L. Pegasi, the largest star, and finally the black hole star. Its scale is beyond words,
80160	86720	over 800,000 times wider than our Sun, 380 times larger than the largest star we know today.
87760	94560	And far below its surface is a black hole, growing rapidly as it devours billions upon billions of
94560	101920	tons of matter per second. Normally, stars are born from gigantic clouds, collections of thousands
101920	108560	or millions of solar masses of mostly hydrogen. In these clouds, matter starts to accumulate around
108560	115440	the densest spots inside. As the spots get denser, their gravitational pull intensifies and they grow
115440	121600	faster. Eventually, they generate so much heat and pressure that they ignite fusion reactions
121600	128240	and a new star is born. But this puts a limit on their size. Nuclear fusion releases enough
128240	134240	radiation energy that the surrounding gas cloud is blown away. The new baby star can't gather
134240	140640	more mass. From now on, the star is living on the edge between two forces, gravity pulling in,
140640	146480	trying to squash the star, and radiation created by fusion pushing outwards, trying to blow the
146480	153040	star apart. After millions or billions of years, the core runs out of fuel and the balance breaks,
153040	161200	destroying the star. But black hole stars were very, very different. The beasts of the early
161200	167120	universe. A few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was much smaller,
167120	172560	all the matter in existence was much more concentrated. The universe was much denser
172560	179280	and hotter. Dark matter was a dominant player, forming giant structures called dark matter halos.
180080	185920	These dark matter halos were so massive that they pulled in and concentrated unimaginably gigantic
185920	192560	amounts of hydrogen gas becoming the birthplaces of the first stars and galaxies. Epic clouds of
192560	198640	hydrogen formed, some as massive as 100 million suns, more than the mass of small galaxies.
199200	204400	In this unique environment that will never exist again, the enormous gravitational pull of the
204400	211600	dark matter halos drew gas into its center and created extremely massive stars. As we said before,
211600	217920	when a star is born, it blows away the gas cloud that created it. But these titanic gas clouds in
217920	223840	the early universe was so large and massive that even after their birth, more and more gas piled
223840	229520	on the newborn star, making it grow to unbelievable proportions. The young star is
229520	235600	forced to grow and grow and grow, getting more and more massive until in some cases, it reaches up to
235600	242240	10 million times the mass of our sun. Crushed by gravity, its core gets hotter and hotter,
242240	248080	desperately pushing outwards, trying to blow itself apart, but to no avail. There's too much
248080	254880	mass and too much pressure. The balance is impossible to uphold. Like a supernova on
254880	260800	fast forward, the core gets crushed into a black hole. Normally, that would be the end. Today's
260800	267600	stars go supernova, a black hole forms and things calm down. But in this case, the star survives
267600	274080	its own death. A tremendous explosion rocks the star from the inside. But it's not enough. The
274080	280080	star is so large and massive that not even a supernova can destroy it. But now it has a black
280080	286400	hole for a heart. It's tiny, a few tens of kilometers in the center of a thing the size of
286400	294800	the solar system. The monster grows. Stars are born from ever faster spinning and collapsing gas.
294800	300960	And so they also spin. When a black hole is born from the core of a star, it keeps its angular
300960	306240	momentum. This means that matter that gets drawn in doesn't just fall in a straight line,
306240	311360	but instead begins orbiting the black hole in smaller and smaller circles going faster and
311360	318080	faster. The result is an accretion disk where gas orbits at nearly the speed of light. Only a small
318080	323920	amount of gas actually falls in at any given moment. Basically, black holes put a lot of food
323920	329600	on the table and only nibble at it. But the matter trapped in the accretion disk doesn't have a good
329600	335280	time. Friction and collisions between particles heated up to temperatures of millions of degrees.
336240	340960	Actively feeding black holes have accretion disks that are incredibly hot and powerful.
341760	346160	This heat from the disk further restricts how much a black hole can devour just like the core
346160	351440	of stars. The super hot material creates radiation that blows away most of the food within its reach.
352080	358560	So even if a black hole had access to as much food as it designed, it can only grow slowly. A black
358560	364000	hole embedded inside a black hole star is different. The enormous pressure surrounding it
364000	369440	pushes down matter directly into the black hole, overcoming all restrictions on how fast it can
369440	376480	consume. This process is so violent and releases so much energy that the accretion disk becomes
376480	382960	hotter and releases more radiation pressure than any star core ever could. Enough to push back
382960	389040	against the weight of 10 million suns. An impossibly dangerous balance has been created.
389760	395520	Millions of solar masses pushing in, the angry radiation of a force-fed black hole pushing out.
396400	400400	For the next few million years, the black hole star is consumed from within.
400960	404880	The black hole grows to thousands of solar masses and the bigger it gets,
404880	411680	the faster it eats, which heats up the star even more and causes it to expand. In its final phase,
411680	417920	the black hole star has become over 30 times wider than our solar system, truly the largest
417920	424640	star to ever exist in the universe. The intense magnetic fields at its core spew out jets of
424640	429920	plasma from the black hole's poles, which pierce through the star and shoot out into space, turning
429920	436240	it into a cosmic beacon. It must have been one of the most awe-inducing sites to ever exist in the
436240	443600	universe. But this also marks the end. It becomes too stretched and the accretion disk within too
443600	451360	powerful. The parasite destroys its host, blowing it apart. A black hole with a mass of 100,000
451360	457280	suns rips its way out to hunt for new prey while leaving behind nothing but a star carcass.
458560	465680	The supermassive question. If black hole stars existed, they could explain one of the greatest
465680	471280	mysteries of the universe. The supermassive black holes we see at the center of galaxies
471280	478640	are just too big. They shouldn't be possible. Black holes born from regular supernovas can be
478640	484880	a few tens of solar masses at most. And because of the process we explained before, they grow
484880	490640	slowly after that. If black holes merge, they can form slightly larger black holes of over 100
490640	496000	solar masses. It should take billions and billions of years to make black holes with
496000	502080	hundreds of thousands or even millions of solar masses. And yet we know that some supermassive
502080	508400	black holes already had 800 million solar masses only 690 million years after the Big Bang.
509520	515840	Black hole stars are a sort of black hole cheat code. If they formed very early in our universe,
515840	519600	and the black holes that emerged from them were thousands of solar masses,
519600	525360	then they could be the seeds for supermassive black holes. These seeds could take root in the
525360	530160	center of the earliest galaxies, merging with others and drawing in enough matter to grow
530160	537440	quickly and reliably. Very soon, we may be able to verify their past existence. The James Webb
537440	542640	Space Telescope is turning its sensors to explore the farthest reaches of the universe, looking back
542640	548880	in time, back to the early universe that we couldn't see before. So with luck, we might be
548880	554400	able to witness glimpses of these tragic Titans in the brief moment between their formation
554400	559920	and destruction. Until then, let's do the visual journey again, just for fun.
559920	574960	Stars are big, black hole stars, bigger.
