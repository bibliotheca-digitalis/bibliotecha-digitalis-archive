00:00.480 --> 00:04.320
Black hole stars may have been the largest stars that ever existed.

00:05.120 --> 00:10.960
They burned brighter than galaxies and were larger than any star today or that could ever exist in

00:10.960 --> 00:17.520
the future. But besides their scale, what makes them special and weird is that deep inside,

00:17.520 --> 00:24.080
they were occupied by a cosmic parasite, an endlessly hungry black hole. How is that even

00:24.080 --> 00:38.880
possible? Black hole stars take the weirdness of black holes and go beyond to break everything we

00:38.880 --> 00:44.480
know about how stars form and grow. They were only possible during a short window of time

00:44.480 --> 00:49.360
in the early universe, but if they existed, they would solve one of the largest mysteries

00:49.360 --> 00:56.720
of cosmology. Black hole stars were excessive any way you look at them. The most massive stars today

00:56.720 --> 01:03.600
may have about 300 solar masses. A black hole star had up to 10 million solar masses of nearly

01:03.600 --> 01:10.960
pure hydrogen. Let's take a moment to look at what this means visually. The Sun, Wesson,

01:10.960 --> 01:19.280
L.L. Pegasi, the largest star, and finally the black hole star. Its scale is beyond words,

01:20.160 --> 01:26.720
over 800,000 times wider than our Sun, 380 times larger than the largest star we know today.

01:27.760 --> 01:34.560
And far below its surface is a black hole, growing rapidly as it devours billions upon billions of

01:34.560 --> 01:41.920
tons of matter per second. Normally, stars are born from gigantic clouds, collections of thousands

01:41.920 --> 01:48.560
or millions of solar masses of mostly hydrogen. In these clouds, matter starts to accumulate around

01:48.560 --> 01:55.440
the densest spots inside. As the spots get denser, their gravitational pull intensifies and they grow

01:55.440 --> 02:01.600
faster. Eventually, they generate so much heat and pressure that they ignite fusion reactions

02:01.600 --> 02:08.240
and a new star is born. But this puts a limit on their size. Nuclear fusion releases enough

02:08.240 --> 02:14.240
radiation energy that the surrounding gas cloud is blown away. The new baby star can't gather

02:14.240 --> 02:20.640
more mass. From now on, the star is living on the edge between two forces, gravity pulling in,

02:20.640 --> 02:26.480
trying to squash the star, and radiation created by fusion pushing outwards, trying to blow the

02:26.480 --> 02:33.040
star apart. After millions or billions of years, the core runs out of fuel and the balance breaks,

02:33.040 --> 02:41.200
destroying the star. But black hole stars were very, very different. The beasts of the early

02:41.200 --> 02:47.120
universe. A few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was much smaller,

02:47.120 --> 02:52.560
all the matter in existence was much more concentrated. The universe was much denser

02:52.560 --> 02:59.280
and hotter. Dark matter was a dominant player, forming giant structures called dark matter halos.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.920
These dark matter halos were so massive that they pulled in and concentrated unimaginably gigantic

03:05.920 --> 03:12.560
amounts of hydrogen gas becoming the birthplaces of the first stars and galaxies. Epic clouds of

03:12.560 --> 03:18.640
hydrogen formed, some as massive as 100 million suns, more than the mass of small galaxies.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.400
In this unique environment that will never exist again, the enormous gravitational pull of the

03:24.400 --> 03:31.600
dark matter halos drew gas into its center and created extremely massive stars. As we said before,

03:31.600 --> 03:37.920
when a star is born, it blows away the gas cloud that created it. But these titanic gas clouds in

03:37.920 --> 03:43.840
the early universe was so large and massive that even after their birth, more and more gas piled

03:43.840 --> 03:49.520
on the newborn star, making it grow to unbelievable proportions. The young star is

03:49.520 --> 03:55.600
forced to grow and grow and grow, getting more and more massive until in some cases, it reaches up to

03:55.600 --> 04:02.240
10 million times the mass of our sun. Crushed by gravity, its core gets hotter and hotter,

04:02.240 --> 04:08.080
desperately pushing outwards, trying to blow itself apart, but to no avail. There's too much

04:08.080 --> 04:14.880
mass and too much pressure. The balance is impossible to uphold. Like a supernova on

04:14.880 --> 04:20.800
fast forward, the core gets crushed into a black hole. Normally, that would be the end. Today's

04:20.800 --> 04:27.600
stars go supernova, a black hole forms and things calm down. But in this case, the star survives

04:27.600 --> 04:34.080
its own death. A tremendous explosion rocks the star from the inside. But it's not enough. The

04:34.080 --> 04:40.080
star is so large and massive that not even a supernova can destroy it. But now it has a black

04:40.080 --> 04:46.400
hole for a heart. It's tiny, a few tens of kilometers in the center of a thing the size of

04:46.400 --> 04:54.800
the solar system. The monster grows. Stars are born from ever faster spinning and collapsing gas.

04:54.800 --> 05:00.960
And so they also spin. When a black hole is born from the core of a star, it keeps its angular

05:00.960 --> 05:06.240
momentum. This means that matter that gets drawn in doesn't just fall in a straight line,

05:06.240 --> 05:11.360
but instead begins orbiting the black hole in smaller and smaller circles going faster and

05:11.360 --> 05:18.080
faster. The result is an accretion disk where gas orbits at nearly the speed of light. Only a small

05:18.080 --> 05:23.920
amount of gas actually falls in at any given moment. Basically, black holes put a lot of food

05:23.920 --> 05:29.600
on the table and only nibble at it. But the matter trapped in the accretion disk doesn't have a good

05:29.600 --> 05:35.280
time. Friction and collisions between particles heated up to temperatures of millions of degrees.

05:36.240 --> 05:40.960
Actively feeding black holes have accretion disks that are incredibly hot and powerful.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.160
This heat from the disk further restricts how much a black hole can devour just like the core

05:46.160 --> 05:51.440
of stars. The super hot material creates radiation that blows away most of the food within its reach.

05:52.080 --> 05:58.560
So even if a black hole had access to as much food as it designed, it can only grow slowly. A black

05:58.560 --> 06:04.000
hole embedded inside a black hole star is different. The enormous pressure surrounding it

06:04.000 --> 06:09.440
pushes down matter directly into the black hole, overcoming all restrictions on how fast it can

06:09.440 --> 06:16.480
consume. This process is so violent and releases so much energy that the accretion disk becomes

06:16.480 --> 06:22.960
hotter and releases more radiation pressure than any star core ever could. Enough to push back

06:22.960 --> 06:29.040
against the weight of 10 million suns. An impossibly dangerous balance has been created.

06:29.760 --> 06:35.520
Millions of solar masses pushing in, the angry radiation of a force-fed black hole pushing out.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.400
For the next few million years, the black hole star is consumed from within.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.880
The black hole grows to thousands of solar masses and the bigger it gets,

06:44.880 --> 06:51.680
the faster it eats, which heats up the star even more and causes it to expand. In its final phase,

06:51.680 --> 06:57.920
the black hole star has become over 30 times wider than our solar system, truly the largest

06:57.920 --> 07:04.640
star to ever exist in the universe. The intense magnetic fields at its core spew out jets of

07:04.640 --> 07:09.920
plasma from the black hole's poles, which pierce through the star and shoot out into space, turning

07:09.920 --> 07:16.240
it into a cosmic beacon. It must have been one of the most awe-inducing sites to ever exist in the

07:16.240 --> 07:23.600
universe. But this also marks the end. It becomes too stretched and the accretion disk within too

07:23.600 --> 07:31.360
powerful. The parasite destroys its host, blowing it apart. A black hole with a mass of 100,000

07:31.360 --> 07:37.280
suns rips its way out to hunt for new prey while leaving behind nothing but a star carcass.

07:38.560 --> 07:45.680
The supermassive question. If black hole stars existed, they could explain one of the greatest

07:45.680 --> 07:51.280
mysteries of the universe. The supermassive black holes we see at the center of galaxies

07:51.280 --> 07:58.640
are just too big. They shouldn't be possible. Black holes born from regular supernovas can be

07:58.640 --> 08:04.880
a few tens of solar masses at most. And because of the process we explained before, they grow

08:04.880 --> 08:10.640
slowly after that. If black holes merge, they can form slightly larger black holes of over 100

08:10.640 --> 08:16.000
solar masses. It should take billions and billions of years to make black holes with

08:16.000 --> 08:22.080
hundreds of thousands or even millions of solar masses. And yet we know that some supermassive

08:22.080 --> 08:28.400
black holes already had 800 million solar masses only 690 million years after the Big Bang.

08:29.520 --> 08:35.840
Black hole stars are a sort of black hole cheat code. If they formed very early in our universe,

08:35.840 --> 08:39.600
and the black holes that emerged from them were thousands of solar masses,

08:39.600 --> 08:45.360
then they could be the seeds for supermassive black holes. These seeds could take root in the

08:45.360 --> 08:50.160
center of the earliest galaxies, merging with others and drawing in enough matter to grow

08:50.160 --> 08:57.440
quickly and reliably. Very soon, we may be able to verify their past existence. The James Webb

08:57.440 --> 09:02.640
Space Telescope is turning its sensors to explore the farthest reaches of the universe, looking back

09:02.640 --> 09:08.880
in time, back to the early universe that we couldn't see before. So with luck, we might be

09:08.880 --> 09:14.400
able to witness glimpses of these tragic Titans in the brief moment between their formation

09:14.400 --> 09:19.920
and destruction. Until then, let's do the visual journey again, just for fun.

09:19.920 --> 09:34.960
Stars are big, black hole stars, bigger.

09:49.920 --> 10:03.680
Planning a long term project like the James Webb Space Telescope requires some serious budgeting.

10:03.680 --> 10:08.320

11:10.400 --> 11:18.240
to be rocket science. We know you've been waiting for a long time. Let's reveal the next limited

11:18.240 --> 11:25.840
edition pin. It's our universe to scale. About 10 to the power of minus 35 seconds after the Big Bang,

11:25.840 --> 11:31.440
the observable universe was only the size of a marble before it expanded. Pre-order is available

11:31.440 --> 11:38.080
for only 72 hours, so you can order it now and then never again. Add it to your pin collection

11:38.080 --> 11:42.160
or start a new one. Pin number three will be revealed soon.

11:42.880 --> 11:49.520
And as the year 12,022 is slowly coming to an end, just kidding, time flies by way too fast,

11:49.520 --> 11:54.160
we'll take a short break to recharge our batteries. Thanks to all of you out there

11:54.160 --> 11:59.360
for all the love and support. We wish you a peaceful and cozy turn of the year.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.640
See you back at full throttle in January.
