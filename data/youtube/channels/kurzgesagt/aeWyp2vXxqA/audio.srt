1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,320
Black hole stars may have been the largest stars that ever existed.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,960
They burned brighter than galaxies and were larger than any star today or that could ever exist in

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,520
the future. But besides their scale, what makes them special and weird is that deep inside,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,080
they were occupied by a cosmic parasite, an endlessly hungry black hole. How is that even

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:38,880
possible? Black hole stars take the weirdness of black holes and go beyond to break everything we

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,480
know about how stars form and grow. They were only possible during a short window of time

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,360
in the early universe, but if they existed, they would solve one of the largest mysteries

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,720
of cosmology. Black hole stars were excessive any way you look at them. The most massive stars today

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,600
may have about 300 solar masses. A black hole star had up to 10 million solar masses of nearly

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,960
pure hydrogen. Let's take a moment to look at what this means visually. The Sun, Wesson,

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,280
L.L. Pegasi, the largest star, and finally the black hole star. Its scale is beyond words,

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,720
over 800,000 times wider than our Sun, 380 times larger than the largest star we know today.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,560
And far below its surface is a black hole, growing rapidly as it devours billions upon billions of

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,920
tons of matter per second. Normally, stars are born from gigantic clouds, collections of thousands

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,560
or millions of solar masses of mostly hydrogen. In these clouds, matter starts to accumulate around

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,440
the densest spots inside. As the spots get denser, their gravitational pull intensifies and they grow

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,600
faster. Eventually, they generate so much heat and pressure that they ignite fusion reactions

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,240
and a new star is born. But this puts a limit on their size. Nuclear fusion releases enough

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,240
radiation energy that the surrounding gas cloud is blown away. The new baby star can't gather

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,640
more mass. From now on, the star is living on the edge between two forces, gravity pulling in,

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,480
trying to squash the star, and radiation created by fusion pushing outwards, trying to blow the

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,040
star apart. After millions or billions of years, the core runs out of fuel and the balance breaks,

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,200
destroying the star. But black hole stars were very, very different. The beasts of the early

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,120
universe. A few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was much smaller,

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,560
all the matter in existence was much more concentrated. The universe was much denser

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,280
and hotter. Dark matter was a dominant player, forming giant structures called dark matter halos.

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,920
These dark matter halos were so massive that they pulled in and concentrated unimaginably gigantic

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,560
amounts of hydrogen gas becoming the birthplaces of the first stars and galaxies. Epic clouds of

29
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,640
hydrogen formed, some as massive as 100 million suns, more than the mass of small galaxies.

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
In this unique environment that will never exist again, the enormous gravitational pull of the

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,600
dark matter halos drew gas into its center and created extremely massive stars. As we said before,

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,920
when a star is born, it blows away the gas cloud that created it. But these titanic gas clouds in

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,840
the early universe was so large and massive that even after their birth, more and more gas piled

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,520
on the newborn star, making it grow to unbelievable proportions. The young star is

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,600
forced to grow and grow and grow, getting more and more massive until in some cases, it reaches up to

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,240
10 million times the mass of our sun. Crushed by gravity, its core gets hotter and hotter,

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,080
desperately pushing outwards, trying to blow itself apart, but to no avail. There's too much

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,880
mass and too much pressure. The balance is impossible to uphold. Like a supernova on

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,800
fast forward, the core gets crushed into a black hole. Normally, that would be the end. Today's

40
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,600
stars go supernova, a black hole forms and things calm down. But in this case, the star survives

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,080
its own death. A tremendous explosion rocks the star from the inside. But it's not enough. The

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,080
star is so large and massive that not even a supernova can destroy it. But now it has a black

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,400
hole for a heart. It's tiny, a few tens of kilometers in the center of a thing the size of

44
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,800
the solar system. The monster grows. Stars are born from ever faster spinning and collapsing gas.

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,960
And so they also spin. When a black hole is born from the core of a star, it keeps its angular

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,240
momentum. This means that matter that gets drawn in doesn't just fall in a straight line,

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,360
but instead begins orbiting the black hole in smaller and smaller circles going faster and

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,080
faster. The result is an accretion disk where gas orbits at nearly the speed of light. Only a small

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,920
amount of gas actually falls in at any given moment. Basically, black holes put a lot of food

50
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,600
on the table and only nibble at it. But the matter trapped in the accretion disk doesn't have a good

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,280
time. Friction and collisions between particles heated up to temperatures of millions of degrees.

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Actively feeding black holes have accretion disks that are incredibly hot and powerful.

53
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,160
This heat from the disk further restricts how much a black hole can devour just like the core

54
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,440
of stars. The super hot material creates radiation that blows away most of the food within its reach.

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,560
So even if a black hole had access to as much food as it designed, it can only grow slowly. A black

56
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,000
hole embedded inside a black hole star is different. The enormous pressure surrounding it

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,440
pushes down matter directly into the black hole, overcoming all restrictions on how fast it can

58
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,480
consume. This process is so violent and releases so much energy that the accretion disk becomes

59
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,960
hotter and releases more radiation pressure than any star core ever could. Enough to push back

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,040
against the weight of 10 million suns. An impossibly dangerous balance has been created.

61
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,520
Millions of solar masses pushing in, the angry radiation of a force-fed black hole pushing out.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
For the next few million years, the black hole star is consumed from within.

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
The black hole grows to thousands of solar masses and the bigger it gets,

64
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,680
the faster it eats, which heats up the star even more and causes it to expand. In its final phase,

65
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,920
the black hole star has become over 30 times wider than our solar system, truly the largest

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,640
star to ever exist in the universe. The intense magnetic fields at its core spew out jets of

67
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,920
plasma from the black hole's poles, which pierce through the star and shoot out into space, turning

68
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,240
it into a cosmic beacon. It must have been one of the most awe-inducing sites to ever exist in the

69
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,600
universe. But this also marks the end. It becomes too stretched and the accretion disk within too

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:31,360
powerful. The parasite destroys its host, blowing it apart. A black hole with a mass of 100,000

71
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,280
suns rips its way out to hunt for new prey while leaving behind nothing but a star carcass.

72
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,680
The supermassive question. If black hole stars existed, they could explain one of the greatest

73
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,280
mysteries of the universe. The supermassive black holes we see at the center of galaxies

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,640
are just too big. They shouldn't be possible. Black holes born from regular supernovas can be

75
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,880
a few tens of solar masses at most. And because of the process we explained before, they grow

76
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,640
slowly after that. If black holes merge, they can form slightly larger black holes of over 100

77
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,000
solar masses. It should take billions and billions of years to make black holes with

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,080
hundreds of thousands or even millions of solar masses. And yet we know that some supermassive

79
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,400
black holes already had 800 million solar masses only 690 million years after the Big Bang.

80
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,840
Black hole stars are a sort of black hole cheat code. If they formed very early in our universe,

81
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,600
and the black holes that emerged from them were thousands of solar masses,

82
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,360
then they could be the seeds for supermassive black holes. These seeds could take root in the

83
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
center of the earliest galaxies, merging with others and drawing in enough matter to grow

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,440
quickly and reliably. Very soon, we may be able to verify their past existence. The James Webb

85
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
Space Telescope is turning its sensors to explore the farthest reaches of the universe, looking back

86
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,880
in time, back to the early universe that we couldn't see before. So with luck, we might be

87
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,400
able to witness glimpses of these tragic Titans in the brief moment between their formation

88
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,920
and destruction. Until then, let's do the visual journey again, just for fun.

89
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:34,960
Stars are big, black hole stars, bigger.

90
00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:03,680
Planning a long term project like the James Webb Space Telescope requires some serious budgeting.

91
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,320
But even personal finances are a nightmare to manage on your own. That's why we want to

104
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,240
to be rocket science. We know you've been waiting for a long time. Let's reveal the next limited

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,840
edition pin. It's our universe to scale. About 10 to the power of minus 35 seconds after the Big Bang,

106
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,440
the observable universe was only the size of a marble before it expanded. Pre-order is available

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,080
for only 72 hours, so you can order it now and then never again. Add it to your pin collection

108
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,160
or start a new one. Pin number three will be revealed soon.

109
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,520
And as the year 12,022 is slowly coming to an end, just kidding, time flies by way too fast,

110
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,160
we'll take a short break to recharge our batteries. Thanks to all of you out there

111
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,360
for all the love and support. We wish you a peaceful and cozy turn of the year.

112
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,640
See you back at full throttle in January.
