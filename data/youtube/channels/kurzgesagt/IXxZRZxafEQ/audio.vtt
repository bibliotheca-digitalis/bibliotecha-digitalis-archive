00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Light is the connection between us and the universe.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.240
Through light, we can experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.000
But what is light?

00:19.440 --> 00:23.760
In a nutshell, light is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.320
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size that can't be split, only created or destroyed.

00:30.320 --> 00:37.440
Light also has a wave-particle duality, being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time, although this is a lie.

00:37.440 --> 00:46.480
Also, when we say light, we actually mean visible light, which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, energy in form of electromagnetic radiation.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.520
Electromagnetic radiation consists of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.520
Gamma rays have the smallest wavelengths because they're the highest energy photons.

00:55.520 --> 01:01.360
But most gamma rays are just under 10 picometers, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.520
For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent is about as big as a cent compared to the moon.

01:07.520 --> 01:15.520
Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum, in the range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, about the size of bacteria.

01:15.520 --> 01:20.400
On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter,

01:20.400 --> 01:28.240
while the biggest wavelengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than Earth.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.680
From a physics standpoint, all these different waves are the same.

01:31.680 --> 01:38.000
They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at c, the speed of light, just at different frequencies.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.960
So what makes visible light special then? Well, absolutely nothing.

01:42.960 --> 01:49.200
We just happen to have evolved eyes that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.320
This is not a complete coincidence, though.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.040
Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates well in water,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.600
which happens to be where most eyes first evolved millions of years ago.

02:01.600 --> 02:09.680
That was a smart move because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,

02:09.680 --> 02:14.560
with almost no delay, which is arguably really helpful for survival.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.720
Okay, where does light come from?

02:16.720 --> 02:23.840
A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.200
They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.520
At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom,

02:31.520 --> 02:37.280
that is, in an excited state, drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy.

02:37.280 --> 02:43.120
The same way incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.760
Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnet field,

02:47.760 --> 02:51.200
which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.240
These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another,

02:56.240 --> 02:59.600
carrying information about its place of creation with it.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.920
Why, of all the things in the universe, is light the fastest thing there is?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.280
Let's change the question.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.320
What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe?

03:08.320 --> 03:18.720
It's c, exactly 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum, 1 billion kilometers per hour.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.640
Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.160
Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.560
The light that's being released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.080
At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.840
So why is c, or the speed of light, finite then?

03:39.840 --> 03:41.440
Well, nobody knows.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.360
Our universe is just built this way.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.280
We don't have a smart answer here.

03:45.280 --> 03:50.400
So light is a part of a spectrum, an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave,

03:50.400 --> 03:55.120
propelled by two perpendicular fields traveling at the speed limit of the universe.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.520
Okay, that's nice and all, but what about all the crazy stuff about traveling at the speed of light

03:59.520 --> 04:03.440
and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, and things like that?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.760
We have to save them for another video.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.840
For now, let's just be happy that we evolved eyes that pick up waves of information

04:09.840 --> 04:15.600
permeating the universe, making us see things that help us to put our existence into perspective.
