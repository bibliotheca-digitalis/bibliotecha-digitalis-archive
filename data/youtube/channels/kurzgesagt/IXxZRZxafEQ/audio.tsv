0	4640	Light is the connection between us and the universe.
4640	10240	Through light, we can experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.
10240	12000	But what is light?
19440	23760	In a nutshell, light is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported.
23760	30320	A photon, an elementary particle without a real size that can't be split, only created or destroyed.
30320	37440	Light also has a wave-particle duality, being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time, although this is a lie.
37440	46480	Also, when we say light, we actually mean visible light, which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, energy in form of electromagnetic radiation.
46480	51520	Electromagnetic radiation consists of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies.
51520	55520	Gamma rays have the smallest wavelengths because they're the highest energy photons.
55520	61360	But most gamma rays are just under 10 picometers, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom.
61360	67520	For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent is about as big as a cent compared to the moon.
67520	75520	Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum, in the range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, about the size of bacteria.
75520	80400	On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter,
80400	88240	while the biggest wavelengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than Earth.
88240	91680	From a physics standpoint, all these different waves are the same.
91680	98000	They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at c, the speed of light, just at different frequencies.
98000	102960	So what makes visible light special then? Well, absolutely nothing.
102960	109200	We just happen to have evolved eyes that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
109200	112320	This is not a complete coincidence, though.
112320	117040	Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates well in water,
117040	121600	which happens to be where most eyes first evolved millions of years ago.
121600	129680	That was a smart move because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,
129680	134560	with almost no delay, which is arguably really helpful for survival.
134560	136720	Okay, where does light come from?
136720	143840	A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one.
143840	147200	They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation.
147200	151520	At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom,
151520	157280	that is, in an excited state, drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy.
157280	163120	The same way incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it.
163120	167760	Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnet field,
167760	171200	which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it.
171200	176240	These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another,
176240	179600	carrying information about its place of creation with it.
179600	183920	Why, of all the things in the universe, is light the fastest thing there is?
183920	185280	Let's change the question.
185280	188320	What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe?
188320	198720	It's c, exactly 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum, 1 billion kilometers per hour.
198720	202640	Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast.
202640	208160	Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between.
208160	212560	The light that's being released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed.
212560	216080	At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c.
216160	219840	So why is c, or the speed of light, finite then?
219840	221440	Well, nobody knows.
221440	223360	Our universe is just built this way.
223360	225280	We don't have a smart answer here.
225280	230400	So light is a part of a spectrum, an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave,
230400	235120	propelled by two perpendicular fields traveling at the speed limit of the universe.
235120	239520	Okay, that's nice and all, but what about all the crazy stuff about traveling at the speed of light
239520	243440	and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, and things like that?
243440	245760	We have to save them for another video.
245760	249840	For now, let's just be happy that we evolved eyes that pick up waves of information
249840	255600	permeating the universe, making us see things that help us to put our existence into perspective.
