1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Light is the connection between us and the universe.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,240
Through light, we can experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
But what is light?

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,760
In a nutshell, light is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,320
A photon, an elementary particle without a real size that can't be split, only created or destroyed.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,440
Light also has a wave-particle duality, being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time, although this is a lie.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,480
Also, when we say light, we actually mean visible light, which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum, energy in form of electromagnetic radiation.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,520
Electromagnetic radiation consists of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Gamma rays have the smallest wavelengths because they're the highest energy photons.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,360
But most gamma rays are just under 10 picometers, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,520
For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent is about as big as a cent compared to the moon.

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum, in the range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, about the size of bacteria.

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter,

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,240
while the biggest wavelengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than Earth.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,680
From a physics standpoint, all these different waves are the same.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,000
They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at c, the speed of light, just at different frequencies.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,960
So what makes visible light special then? Well, absolutely nothing.

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
We just happen to have evolved eyes that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
This is not a complete coincidence, though.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,040
Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates well in water,

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
which happens to be where most eyes first evolved millions of years ago.

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,680
That was a smart move because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,560
with almost no delay, which is arguably really helpful for survival.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
Okay, where does light come from?

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,840
A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,200
They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,520
At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom,

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,280
that is, in an excited state, drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy.

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
The same way incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,760
Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnet field,

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,240
These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another,

33
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,600
carrying information about its place of creation with it.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,920
Why, of all the things in the universe, is light the fastest thing there is?

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
Let's change the question.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,320
What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe?

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:18,720
It's c, exactly 299,792,458 meters per second in a vacuum, 1 billion kilometers per hour.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast.

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,160
Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between.

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,560
The light that's being released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed.

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,080
At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,840
So why is c, or the speed of light, finite then?

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
Well, nobody knows.

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
Our universe is just built this way.

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
We don't have a smart answer here.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
So light is a part of a spectrum, an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave,

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
propelled by two perpendicular fields traveling at the speed limit of the universe.

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,520
Okay, that's nice and all, but what about all the crazy stuff about traveling at the speed of light

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,440
and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, and things like that?

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
We have to save them for another video.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
For now, let's just be happy that we evolved eyes that pick up waves of information

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,600
permeating the universe, making us see things that help us to put our existence into perspective.
