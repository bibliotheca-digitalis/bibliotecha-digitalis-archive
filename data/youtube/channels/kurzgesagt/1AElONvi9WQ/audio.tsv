0	4000	Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.
4000	8320	In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered
8320	13320	a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day.
13320	17960	Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn't make any sense.
17960	21400	The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.
21400	26000	To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.
30000	38960	Our cells are protein robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts.
38960	45280	Guided only by chemical reactions, they create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism
45280	50000	to gain energy, or make almost perfect copies of themselves.
50000	53620	We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.
53620	59820	They are biochemical networks upon networks, intertwined and stacked on top of each other.
59820	64220	Most of them can barely be comprehended by a single human mind, and yet they function
64220	65220	perfectly.
65220	68500	Until they don't.
68500	73680	With billions of trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over many years,
73680	77840	the question is not if something will go wrong, but when.
77840	82460	Tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets corrupted.
82460	86800	To prevent this from getting out of hand, our cells have kill switches that make them
86800	88640	commit suicide.
88640	91620	But these kill switches are not infallible.
91620	95480	If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.
95480	98860	Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly.
98860	100660	But this is a numbers game.
100660	105420	Given enough time, a cell will accrue enough mistakes, slip by unnoticed, and begin making
105420	107020	more of itself.
107020	110040	All animals have to deal with this problem.
110040	114260	In general, the cells of different animals are the same size.
114260	117040	The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.
117260	121100	It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan.
121100	126780	Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong or cells mutating.
126780	129740	Or at least it should mean that.
129740	134540	Humans live about 50 times longer and have 1,000 times more cells than mice.
134540	139160	Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice.
139160	144460	Even wader, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer
144460	146380	at all really.
146400	152760	This is Pitot's paradox, the baffling realization that large animals have much, much less cancer
152760	154960	than they should.
154960	161360	Scientists think there are two main ways of explaining the paradox, evolution and hypertumors.
161360	165520	Solution one, evolve or become a blob of cancer.
165520	171700	As multicellular beings developed 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger,
171700	176280	which added more and more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could be
176280	177480	corrupted.
177480	181520	So the collective had to invest in better and better cancer defenses.
181520	184160	The ones that did not died out.
184160	189040	But cancer doesn't just happen, it's a process that involves many individual mistakes and
189040	193640	mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.
193640	199600	These genes are called proto-oncogenes and when they mutate, it's bad news.
199600	205140	For example, with the right mutation, a cell will lose its ability to kill itself.
205140	208540	Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide.
208540	211800	Another and it will send out calls for resources.
211800	214680	Another one and it will multiply quickly.
214680	219880	These oncogenes have an antagonist though, tumor suppressor genes.
219880	224260	They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself
224260	226660	if they decide it's beyond repair.
226660	230620	It turns out that large animals have an increased number of them.
230620	235500	Because of this, elephant cells require more mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor.
235500	238760	They are not immune, but more resilient.
238760	243120	This adaption probably comes with a cost in some form, but researchers still aren't
243120	244700	sure what it is.
244700	249520	Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly
249520	250920	injuries heal.
250920	252700	We don't know yet.
252780	256660	The solution to the paradox may actually be something different.
256660	258780	Hyper tumors.
258780	261060	Solution two, hyper tumors.
261060	263560	Yes, really.
263560	268620	Hyper tumors are named after hyper parasites, the parasites of parasites.
268620	271700	Hyper tumors are the tumors of tumors.
271700	274660	Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation.
274660	280300	Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune
280300	281300	system.
281860	286100	Cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short term benefit.
286100	290740	If they're successful, they form tumors, huge cancer collectives that can be very hard
290740	292420	to kill.
292420	295060	Making a tumor is hard work, though.
295060	299880	Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly, which requires a lot of resources
299880	301160	and energy.
301160	306380	The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body becomes the limiting factor for growth.
306380	310780	So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor to
310780	313120	feed the thing killing it.
313120	317760	And here, the nature of cancer cells may become their own undoing.
317760	322940	Cancer cells are inherently unstable, and so they can continue to mutate, some of them
322940	325180	faster than their buddies.
325180	329780	If they do this for a while, at some point, one of the copies of the copies of the original
329780	335740	cancer cell might suddenly think of itself as an individual again and stop cooperating.
335740	340760	Which means just like the body, the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy fighting for
340760	344040	the same scarce nutrients and resources.
344040	348700	So the newly mutated cells can create a hyper tumor.
348700	352200	Instead of helping, they cut off the blood supply to their former buddies, which will
352200	355720	starve and kill the original cancer cells.
355720	357920	Cancer is killing cancer.
357920	360540	This process can repeat over and over.
360540	365160	And this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism.
365160	369420	It is possible that large animals have more of these hyper tumors than we realize.
369420	372040	They might just not become big enough to notice.
372040	373040	Which makes sense.
373040	380520	A 2 gram tumor is 10% of a mouse's body weight, while it's less than 0.002% of a human, and
380520	385260	0.00002% of a blue whale.
385260	389380	All three tumors require the same number of cell divisions and have the same number of
389380	390380	cells.
390380	395180	So an old blue whale might be filled with tiny cancers and just not care.
395180	399820	There are other proposed solutions to Pitot's paradox, such as different metabolic rates
399820	402180	or different cellular architecture.
402180	404620	But right now we just don't know.
404620	406740	Scientists are working on the problem.
406740	411340	Figuring out how large animals are so resilient to one of the most deadly diseases we know
411340	416420	could open the path to new therapies and treatments.
416420	418500	Cancer has always been a challenge.
418500	424460	Today, we are finally beginning to understand it, and by doing so, one day we might finally
424460	427500	overcome it.
