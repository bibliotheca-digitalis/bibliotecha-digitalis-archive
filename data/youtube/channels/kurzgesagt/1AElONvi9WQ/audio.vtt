00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.320
In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered

00:08.320 --> 00:13.320
a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.960
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn't make any sense.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.400
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.000
To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.960
Our cells are protein robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts.

00:38.960 --> 00:45.280
Guided only by chemical reactions, they create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism

00:45.280 --> 00:50.000
to gain energy, or make almost perfect copies of themselves.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.620
We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.

00:53.620 --> 00:59.820
They are biochemical networks upon networks, intertwined and stacked on top of each other.

00:59.820 --> 01:04.220
Most of them can barely be comprehended by a single human mind, and yet they function

01:04.220 --> 01:05.220
perfectly.

01:05.220 --> 01:08.500
Until they don't.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.680
With billions of trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over many years,

01:13.680 --> 01:17.840
the question is not if something will go wrong, but when.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.460
Tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets corrupted.

01:22.460 --> 01:26.800
To prevent this from getting out of hand, our cells have kill switches that make them

01:26.800 --> 01:28.640
commit suicide.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.620
But these kill switches are not infallible.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.480
If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.860
Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.660
But this is a numbers game.

01:40.660 --> 01:45.420
Given enough time, a cell will accrue enough mistakes, slip by unnoticed, and begin making

01:45.420 --> 01:47.020
more of itself.

01:47.020 --> 01:50.040
All animals have to deal with this problem.

01:50.040 --> 01:54.260
In general, the cells of different animals are the same size.

01:54.260 --> 01:57.040
The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.

01:57.260 --> 02:01.100
It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan.

02:01.100 --> 02:06.780
Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong or cells mutating.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.740
Or at least it should mean that.

02:09.740 --> 02:14.540
Humans live about 50 times longer and have 1,000 times more cells than mice.

02:14.540 --> 02:19.160
Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.460
Even wader, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer

02:24.460 --> 02:26.380
at all really.

02:26.400 --> 02:32.760
This is Pitot's paradox, the baffling realization that large animals have much, much less cancer

02:32.760 --> 02:34.960
than they should.

02:34.960 --> 02:41.360
Scientists think there are two main ways of explaining the paradox, evolution and hypertumors.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.520
Solution one, evolve or become a blob of cancer.

02:45.520 --> 02:51.700
As multicellular beings developed 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger,

02:51.700 --> 02:56.280
which added more and more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could be

02:56.280 --> 02:57.480
corrupted.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.520
So the collective had to invest in better and better cancer defenses.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.160
The ones that did not died out.

03:04.160 --> 03:09.040
But cancer doesn't just happen, it's a process that involves many individual mistakes and

03:09.040 --> 03:13.640
mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.

03:13.640 --> 03:19.600
These genes are called proto-oncogenes and when they mutate, it's bad news.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.140
For example, with the right mutation, a cell will lose its ability to kill itself.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.540
Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.800
Another and it will send out calls for resources.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.680
Another one and it will multiply quickly.

03:34.680 --> 03:39.880
These oncogenes have an antagonist though, tumor suppressor genes.

03:39.880 --> 03:44.260
They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself

03:44.260 --> 03:46.660
if they decide it's beyond repair.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.620
It turns out that large animals have an increased number of them.

03:50.620 --> 03:55.500
Because of this, elephant cells require more mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.760
They are not immune, but more resilient.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.120
This adaption probably comes with a cost in some form, but researchers still aren't

04:03.120 --> 04:04.700
sure what it is.

04:04.700 --> 04:09.520
Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly

04:09.520 --> 04:10.920
injuries heal.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.700
We don't know yet.

04:12.780 --> 04:16.660
The solution to the paradox may actually be something different.

04:16.660 --> 04:18.780
Hyper tumors.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.060
Solution two, hyper tumors.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.560
Yes, really.

04:23.560 --> 04:28.620
Hyper tumors are named after hyper parasites, the parasites of parasites.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.700
Hyper tumors are the tumors of tumors.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.660
Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation.

04:34.660 --> 04:40.300
Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune

04:40.300 --> 04:41.300
system.

04:41.860 --> 04:46.100
Cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short term benefit.

04:46.100 --> 04:50.740
If they're successful, they form tumors, huge cancer collectives that can be very hard

04:50.740 --> 04:52.420
to kill.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.060
Making a tumor is hard work, though.

04:55.060 --> 04:59.880
Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly, which requires a lot of resources

04:59.880 --> 05:01.160
and energy.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.380
The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body becomes the limiting factor for growth.

05:06.380 --> 05:10.780
So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor to

05:10.780 --> 05:13.120
feed the thing killing it.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.760
And here, the nature of cancer cells may become their own undoing.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.940
Cancer cells are inherently unstable, and so they can continue to mutate, some of them

05:22.940 --> 05:25.180
faster than their buddies.

05:25.180 --> 05:29.780
If they do this for a while, at some point, one of the copies of the copies of the original

05:29.780 --> 05:35.740
cancer cell might suddenly think of itself as an individual again and stop cooperating.

05:35.740 --> 05:40.760
Which means just like the body, the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy fighting for

05:40.760 --> 05:44.040
the same scarce nutrients and resources.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.700
So the newly mutated cells can create a hyper tumor.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.200
Instead of helping, they cut off the blood supply to their former buddies, which will

05:52.200 --> 05:55.720
starve and kill the original cancer cells.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.920
Cancer is killing cancer.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.540
This process can repeat over and over.

06:00.540 --> 06:05.160
And this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.420
It is possible that large animals have more of these hyper tumors than we realize.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.040
They might just not become big enough to notice.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.040
Which makes sense.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.520
A 2 gram tumor is 10% of a mouse's body weight, while it's less than 0.002% of a human, and

06:20.520 --> 06:25.260
0.00002% of a blue whale.

06:25.260 --> 06:29.380
All three tumors require the same number of cell divisions and have the same number of

06:29.380 --> 06:30.380
cells.

06:30.380 --> 06:35.180
So an old blue whale might be filled with tiny cancers and just not care.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.820
There are other proposed solutions to Pitot's paradox, such as different metabolic rates

06:39.820 --> 06:42.180
or different cellular architecture.

06:42.180 --> 06:44.620
But right now we just don't know.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.740
Scientists are working on the problem.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.340
Figuring out how large animals are so resilient to one of the most deadly diseases we know

06:51.340 --> 06:56.420
could open the path to new therapies and treatments.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.500
Cancer has always been a challenge.

06:58.500 --> 07:04.460
Today, we are finally beginning to understand it, and by doing so, one day we might finally

07:04.460 --> 07:07.500
overcome it.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.500
This video was sponsored by you.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
If you want to help us make more, you can do so by supporting us on Patreon or getting

07:14.500 --> 07:18.880
one of the beautiful things we've made, like our Space Explorer notebook, with infographic

07:18.880 --> 07:24.340
pages and unique grids to inspire your creativity, or an infographic poster bundle, or the very

07:24.340 --> 07:26.220
comfy Kurzgesagt hoodie.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.440
Or, if you missed it the first time, the second run of our gratitude journal.

07:30.440 --> 07:35.160
We put a lot of time and love into our merch, because, just like with our videos, we only

07:35.160 --> 07:38.240
want to put things into the world that we feel good about.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.140
Kurzgesagt is a project that, by rights, shouldn't really work.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.960
Videos like the one you just watched take months to finish, and we're only able to put

07:45.960 --> 07:51.640
in so much time because of your direct support, because you watch and share, and because you

07:51.640 --> 07:52.640
care.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.760
Thank you for watching.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.760
See you next time.
