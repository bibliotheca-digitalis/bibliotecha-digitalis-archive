1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,320
a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,960
Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn't make any sense.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,400
The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,960
Our cells are protein robots made out of hundreds of millions of parts.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,280
Guided only by chemical reactions, they create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
to gain energy, or make almost perfect copies of themselves.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,620
We call these complex chemical reactions pathways.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,820
They are biochemical networks upon networks, intertwined and stacked on top of each other.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,220
Most of them can barely be comprehended by a single human mind, and yet they function

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,220
perfectly.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,500
Until they don't.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,680
With billions of trillions of reactions happening in thousands of networks over many years,

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
the question is not if something will go wrong, but when.

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,460
Tiny mistakes add up until the grandiose machinery gets corrupted.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,800
To prevent this from getting out of hand, our cells have kill switches that make them

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
commit suicide.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,620
But these kill switches are not infallible.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,480
If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,860
Most of them are slain by the immune system very quickly.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,660
But this is a numbers game.

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,420
Given enough time, a cell will accrue enough mistakes, slip by unnoticed, and begin making

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,020
more of itself.

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,040
All animals have to deal with this problem.

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,260
In general, the cells of different animals are the same size.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,040
The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,100
It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,780
Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance of things going wrong or cells mutating.

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,740
Or at least it should mean that.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,540
Humans live about 50 times longer and have 1,000 times more cells than mice.

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,160
Yet the rate of cancer is basically the same in humans and in mice.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,460
Even wader, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,380
at all really.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,760
This is Pitot's paradox, the baffling realization that large animals have much, much less cancer

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,960
than they should.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,360
Scientists think there are two main ways of explaining the paradox, evolution and hypertumors.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,520
Solution one, evolve or become a blob of cancer.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,700
As multicellular beings developed 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger,

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,280
which added more and more cells and hence more and more chances that cells could be

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
corrupted.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,520
So the collective had to invest in better and better cancer defenses.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,160
The ones that did not died out.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,040
But cancer doesn't just happen, it's a process that involves many individual mistakes and

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,640
mutations in several specific genes within the same cell.

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,600
These genes are called proto-oncogenes and when they mutate, it's bad news.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,140
For example, with the right mutation, a cell will lose its ability to kill itself.

49
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,540
Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide.

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,800
Another and it will send out calls for resources.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,680
Another one and it will multiply quickly.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,880
These oncogenes have an antagonist though, tumor suppressor genes.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,260
They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself

54
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,660
if they decide it's beyond repair.

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,620
It turns out that large animals have an increased number of them.

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,500
Because of this, elephant cells require more mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor.

57
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,760
They are not immune, but more resilient.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,120
This adaption probably comes with a cost in some form, but researchers still aren't

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,700
sure what it is.

60
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,520
Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
injuries heal.

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,700
We don't know yet.

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,660
The solution to the paradox may actually be something different.

64
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,780
Hyper tumors.

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,060
Solution two, hyper tumors.

66
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,560
Yes, really.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,620
Hyper tumors are named after hyper parasites, the parasites of parasites.

68
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,700
Hyper tumors are the tumors of tumors.

69
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,660
Cancer can be thought of as a breakdown in cooperation.

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,300
Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
system.

72
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,100
Cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short term benefit.

73
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,740
If they're successful, they form tumors, huge cancer collectives that can be very hard

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,420
to kill.

75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,060
Making a tumor is hard work, though.

76
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,880
Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly, which requires a lot of resources

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,160
and energy.

78
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,380
The amount of nutrients they can steal from the body becomes the limiting factor for growth.

79
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,780
So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor to

80
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,120
feed the thing killing it.

81
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,760
And here, the nature of cancer cells may become their own undoing.

82
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,940
Cancer cells are inherently unstable, and so they can continue to mutate, some of them

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,180
faster than their buddies.

84
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,780
If they do this for a while, at some point, one of the copies of the copies of the original

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,740
cancer cell might suddenly think of itself as an individual again and stop cooperating.

86
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,760
Which means just like the body, the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy fighting for

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,040
the same scarce nutrients and resources.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,700
So the newly mutated cells can create a hyper tumor.

89
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,200
Instead of helping, they cut off the blood supply to their former buddies, which will

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,720
starve and kill the original cancer cells.

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Cancer is killing cancer.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,540
This process can repeat over and over.

93
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,160
And this may prevent cancer from becoming a problem for a large organism.

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,420
It is possible that large animals have more of these hyper tumors than we realize.

95
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,040
They might just not become big enough to notice.

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Which makes sense.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,520
A 2 gram tumor is 10% of a mouse's body weight, while it's less than 0.002% of a human, and

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,260
0.00002% of a blue whale.

99
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,380
All three tumors require the same number of cell divisions and have the same number of

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
cells.

101
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,180
So an old blue whale might be filled with tiny cancers and just not care.

102
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,820
There are other proposed solutions to Pitot's paradox, such as different metabolic rates

103
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,180
or different cellular architecture.

104
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,620
But right now we just don't know.

105
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,740
Scientists are working on the problem.

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,340
Figuring out how large animals are so resilient to one of the most deadly diseases we know

107
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,420
could open the path to new therapies and treatments.

108
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,500
Cancer has always been a challenge.

109
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,460
Today, we are finally beginning to understand it, and by doing so, one day we might finally

110
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,500
overcome it.

111
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
This video was sponsored by you.

Or, if you missed it the first time, the second run of our gratitude journal.

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,160
We put a lot of time and love into our merch, because, just like with our videos, we only

118
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,240
want to put things into the world that we feel good about.

119
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,140
Kurzgesagt is a project that, by rights, shouldn't really work.

120
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,960
Videos like the one you just watched take months to finish, and we're only able to put

121
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,640
in so much time because of your direct support, because you watch and share, and because you

122
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
care.

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
Thank you for watching.

124
