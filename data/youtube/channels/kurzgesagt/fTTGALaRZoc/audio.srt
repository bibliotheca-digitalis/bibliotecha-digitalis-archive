1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The international banking system is an enigma.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There are more than 30,000 different banks worldwide,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and they hold unbelievable amounts of assets.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The top 10 banks alone account for roughly 25 trillion US dollars.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, banking can seem very complex,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but originally, the idea was to make life simpler.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
11th century Italy was the center of European trading.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Merchants from all over the continent met to trade their goods,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
but there was one problem.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Too many currencies in circulation.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In Pisa, merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and had to exchange their money constantly.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This exchange business, which commonly took place outdoors on benches,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is where we get the word bank from, from the word bankol, Italian for bench.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The dangers of traveling, counterfeit money,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and the difficulty of getting a loan got people thinking.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was time for a new business model.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hornbrokers started to give credit to businessmen,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
while Genoese merchants developed cashless payments.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Networks of banks spread all over Europe,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
handing out credit even to the Church or European kings.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What about today?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In a nutshell, banks are in the risk management business.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is a simplified version of the way it works.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
People keep their money in banks and receive a small amount of interest.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The bank takes this money and lends it out at much higher interest rates.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a calculated risk because some of the lenders will default on their credit.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This process is essential for our economic system

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because it provides resources for people to buy things like houses

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or for industry to expand their businesses and grow.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So banks take funds that are unused by savers

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and turn them into funds society can use to do stuff.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Other sources of income for banks include accepting saving deposits,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the credit card business, buying and selling currencies,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
custodian business, and cash management services.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The main problem with banks nowadays is that a lot of them have abandoned

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
their traditional role as providers of long-term financial products

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
in favor of short-term gains that carry much higher risks.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
During the financial boom, most major banks adopted financial constructs

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that were barely comprehensible and did their own trading in a bid

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to make fast money and earn their executives and traders millions in bonuses.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Like back in 2008, when banks like Lehman Brothers gave credit

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to basically anyone who wanted to buy a house

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and thereby put the bank in an extremely dangerous risk position.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This led to the collapse of the housing market in the US and parts of Europe

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
causing stock prices to plummet which eventually led to a global banking crisis

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and one of the largest financial crises in history.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hundreds of billions of dollars just evaporated.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and bankers became some of the least trusted professionals.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The US government and the European Union had to put together huge bailout packages

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Compulsory bank emergency funds were enforced to absorb shocks

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in the event of another financial crisis.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But other pieces of tough new legislation were successfully blocked by the banking lobby.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Today other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like new investment banks that charge a yearly fee

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and do not get commissions on sales,

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
thus providing the motivation to act in the best interests of their clients.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or credit unions, cooperative initiatives that were established in the 19th century

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to circumvent credit sharks.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In a nutshell, they provide the same financial services as banks

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but focus on shared value rather than profit maximization.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The self-proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
like starting small businesses, expanding farms or building family homes,

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
while investing back into communities.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They are controlled by their members, who also elect the board of directors democratically.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Worldwide, credit union systems vary significantly,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ranging from a handful of members to organizations worth several billion US dollars

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and hundreds of thousands of members.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are willing to take,

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
which explains why credit unions, although also hurting,

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Aside from making awesome video games possible,

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
platforms arose that enable people to get loans from large groups of small investors,

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
circumventing the bank as a middleman.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But it also works for industry.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Lots of new technology companies started out on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and can invest in ideas they believe in,

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
while spreading the risk so widely that if the project fails, the damage is limited.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And last but not least, microcredits.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Lots of very small loans, mostly handed out in developing countries that help people escape poverty.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to start a business

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
because they weren't deemed worth the time.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nowadays, the granting of microcredits has evolved into a multi-billion dollar business.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So banking might not be up your street,

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but the bank's role of providing funds to people and businesses is crucial for our society and has to be done.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to decide though.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:09,000
