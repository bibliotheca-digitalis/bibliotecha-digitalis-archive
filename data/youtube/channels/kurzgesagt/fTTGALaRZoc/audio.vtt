00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The international banking system is an enigma.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
There are more than 30,000 different banks worldwide,

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
and they hold unbelievable amounts of assets.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The top 10 banks alone account for roughly 25 trillion US dollars.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Today, banking can seem very complex,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
but originally, the idea was to make life simpler.

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
11th century Italy was the center of European trading.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Merchants from all over the continent met to trade their goods,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
but there was one problem.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Too many currencies in circulation.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
In Pisa, merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and had to exchange their money constantly.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
This exchange business, which commonly took place outdoors on benches,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
is where we get the word bank from, from the word bankol, Italian for bench.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
The dangers of traveling, counterfeit money,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and the difficulty of getting a loan got people thinking.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
It was time for a new business model.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Hornbrokers started to give credit to businessmen,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
while Genoese merchants developed cashless payments.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Networks of banks spread all over Europe,

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
handing out credit even to the Church or European kings.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
What about today?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
In a nutshell, banks are in the risk management business.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
This is a simplified version of the way it works.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
People keep their money in banks and receive a small amount of interest.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
The bank takes this money and lends it out at much higher interest rates.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
It's a calculated risk because some of the lenders will default on their credit.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
This process is essential for our economic system

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
because it provides resources for people to buy things like houses

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
or for industry to expand their businesses and grow.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
So banks take funds that are unused by savers

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
and turn them into funds society can use to do stuff.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Other sources of income for banks include accepting saving deposits,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
the credit card business, buying and selling currencies,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
custodian business, and cash management services.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
The main problem with banks nowadays is that a lot of them have abandoned

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
their traditional role as providers of long-term financial products

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
in favor of short-term gains that carry much higher risks.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
During the financial boom, most major banks adopted financial constructs

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
that were barely comprehensible and did their own trading in a bid

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
to make fast money and earn their executives and traders millions in bonuses.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Like back in 2008, when banks like Lehman Brothers gave credit

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
to basically anyone who wanted to buy a house

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
and thereby put the bank in an extremely dangerous risk position.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
This led to the collapse of the housing market in the US and parts of Europe

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
causing stock prices to plummet which eventually led to a global banking crisis

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
and one of the largest financial crises in history.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Hundreds of billions of dollars just evaporated.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
and bankers became some of the least trusted professionals.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
The US government and the European Union had to put together huge bailout packages

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Compulsory bank emergency funds were enforced to absorb shocks

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
in the event of another financial crisis.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
But other pieces of tough new legislation were successfully blocked by the banking lobby.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Today other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Like new investment banks that charge a yearly fee

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
and do not get commissions on sales,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
thus providing the motivation to act in the best interests of their clients.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Or credit unions, cooperative initiatives that were established in the 19th century

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
to circumvent credit sharks.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
In a nutshell, they provide the same financial services as banks

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
but focus on shared value rather than profit maximization.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
The self-proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
like starting small businesses, expanding farms or building family homes,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
while investing back into communities.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
They are controlled by their members, who also elect the board of directors democratically.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Worldwide, credit union systems vary significantly,

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
ranging from a handful of members to organizations worth several billion US dollars

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and hundreds of thousands of members.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are willing to take,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
which explains why credit unions, although also hurting,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Aside from making awesome video games possible,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
platforms arose that enable people to get loans from large groups of small investors,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
circumventing the bank as a middleman.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
But it also works for industry.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Lots of new technology companies started out on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
and can invest in ideas they believe in,

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
while spreading the risk so widely that if the project fails, the damage is limited.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And last but not least, microcredits.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Lots of very small loans, mostly handed out in developing countries that help people escape poverty.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to start a business

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
because they weren't deemed worth the time.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Nowadays, the granting of microcredits has evolved into a multi-billion dollar business.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So banking might not be up your street,

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
but the bank's role of providing funds to people and businesses is crucial for our society and has to be done.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to decide though.

05:57.000 --> 06:09.000
