0	4000	The international banking system is an enigma.
4000	7000	There are more than 30,000 different banks worldwide,
7000	10000	and they hold unbelievable amounts of assets.
10000	15000	The top 10 banks alone account for roughly 25 trillion US dollars.
15000	18000	Today, banking can seem very complex,
18000	21000	but originally, the idea was to make life simpler.
21000	31000	11th century Italy was the center of European trading.
31000	35000	Merchants from all over the continent met to trade their goods,
35000	36000	but there was one problem.
36000	39000	Too many currencies in circulation.
39000	43000	In Pisa, merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins
43000	46000	and had to exchange their money constantly.
46000	50000	This exchange business, which commonly took place outdoors on benches,
50000	55000	is where we get the word bank from, from the word bankol, Italian for bench.
55000	58000	The dangers of traveling, counterfeit money,
58000	61000	and the difficulty of getting a loan got people thinking.
61000	64000	It was time for a new business model.
64000	67000	Hornbrokers started to give credit to businessmen,
67000	70000	while Genoese merchants developed cashless payments.
70000	73000	Networks of banks spread all over Europe,
73000	77000	handing out credit even to the Church or European kings.
77000	78000	What about today?
78000	82000	In a nutshell, banks are in the risk management business.
82000	85000	This is a simplified version of the way it works.
85000	89000	People keep their money in banks and receive a small amount of interest.
89000	94000	The bank takes this money and lends it out at much higher interest rates.
94000	99000	It's a calculated risk because some of the lenders will default on their credit.
99000	102000	This process is essential for our economic system
102000	105000	because it provides resources for people to buy things like houses
105000	109000	or for industry to expand their businesses and grow.
109000	112000	So banks take funds that are unused by savers
112000	115000	and turn them into funds society can use to do stuff.
115000	119000	Other sources of income for banks include accepting saving deposits,
119000	122000	the credit card business, buying and selling currencies,
122000	126000	custodian business, and cash management services.
126000	130000	The main problem with banks nowadays is that a lot of them have abandoned
130000	133000	their traditional role as providers of long-term financial products
133000	137000	in favor of short-term gains that carry much higher risks.
137000	142000	During the financial boom, most major banks adopted financial constructs
142000	145000	that were barely comprehensible and did their own trading in a bid
145000	150000	to make fast money and earn their executives and traders millions in bonuses.
150000	155000	This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies.
155000	159000	Like back in 2008, when banks like Lehman Brothers gave credit
159000	162000	to basically anyone who wanted to buy a house
162000	165000	and thereby put the bank in an extremely dangerous risk position.
165000	169000	This led to the collapse of the housing market in the US and parts of Europe
169000	173000	causing stock prices to plummet which eventually led to a global banking crisis
173000	177000	and one of the largest financial crises in history.
177000	181000	Hundreds of billions of dollars just evaporated.
181000	185000	Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money.
185000	188000	Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines
188000	191000	and bankers became some of the least trusted professionals.
191000	195000	The US government and the European Union had to put together huge bailout packages
195000	199000	to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt.
199000	203000	New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business.
203000	206000	Compulsory bank emergency funds were enforced to absorb shocks
206000	209000	in the event of another financial crisis.
209000	214000	But other pieces of tough new legislation were successfully blocked by the banking lobby.
214000	218000	Today other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast.
218000	221000	Like new investment banks that charge a yearly fee
221000	224000	and do not get commissions on sales,
224000	228000	thus providing the motivation to act in the best interests of their clients.
228000	232000	Or credit unions, cooperative initiatives that were established in the 19th century
232000	234000	to circumvent credit sharks.
234000	238000	In a nutshell, they provide the same financial services as banks
238000	242000	but focus on shared value rather than profit maximization.
242000	246000	The self-proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities
246000	251000	like starting small businesses, expanding farms or building family homes,
251000	253000	while investing back into communities.
253000	258000	They are controlled by their members, who also elect the board of directors democratically.
258000	262000	Worldwide, credit union systems vary significantly,
262000	266000	ranging from a handful of members to organizations worth several billion US dollars
266000	269000	and hundreds of thousands of members.
269000	274000	The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are willing to take,
274000	277000	which explains why credit unions, although also hurting,
277000	282000	survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks.
282000	285000	Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years.
285000	288000	Aside from making awesome video games possible,
288000	293000	platforms arose that enable people to get loans from large groups of small investors,
293000	295000	circumventing the bank as a middleman.
295000	297000	But it also works for industry.
297000	301000	Lots of new technology companies started out on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
301000	305000	The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing
305000	307000	and can invest in ideas they believe in,
307000	312000	while spreading the risk so widely that if the project fails, the damage is limited.
312000	314000	And last but not least, microcredits.
314000	320000	Lots of very small loans, mostly handed out in developing countries that help people escape poverty.
320000	324000	People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to start a business
324000	327000	because they weren't deemed worth the time.
327000	332000	Nowadays, the granting of microcredits has evolved into a multi-billion dollar business.
332000	335000	So banking might not be up your street,
335000	341000	but the bank's role of providing funds to people and businesses is crucial for our society and has to be done.
341000	346000	Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to decide though.
