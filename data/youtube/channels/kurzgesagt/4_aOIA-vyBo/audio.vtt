One day the universe will die, but why and how? And will the universe be dead forever?

00:08.360 --> 00:14.760
And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding, and not only that,

00:14.760 --> 00:21.440
the rate of its expansion is accelerating. The reason? Dark energy. Dark energy is a

00:21.440 --> 00:27.760
strange phenomenon that scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998, we thought

00:27.800 --> 00:32.720
that the universe must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up,

00:32.720 --> 00:38.200
but at some point it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe is actually

00:38.200 --> 00:44.760
speeding up. That's like throwing a ball up and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster.

00:44.760 --> 00:53.200
Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don't know, but we call it dark energy. Einstein

00:53.240 --> 00:59.360
thought of it first, and then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have decided it

00:59.360 --> 01:05.000
is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical, and we don't actually know what

01:05.000 --> 01:10.080
the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories, and they lead us to three

01:10.080 --> 01:24.680
scenarios for the end of the universe. One, the big rip. Since its birth, the universe has been

01:24.680 --> 01:30.680
expanding. For unknown reasons, new space is created everywhere equally. The space between

01:30.680 --> 01:37.760
galaxies expands, so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands, but here gravity

01:37.760 --> 01:43.520
is strong enough to keep them together. In the big rip scenario, the expansion accelerates up

01:43.520 --> 01:48.520
to a point where space expands so fast that gravity can't compensate for this effect anymore.

01:48.520 --> 01:55.120
The result is a big rip. At first, only large structures like galaxies are torn apart,

01:55.120 --> 02:01.300
since space between the single objects expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,

02:01.300 --> 02:06.560
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn't strong enough to keep them together, so they

02:06.560 --> 02:13.360
dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand faster than the speed of light. Atoms

02:13.360 --> 02:18.840
would now be affected, and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,

02:18.840 --> 02:24.480
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would

02:24.480 --> 02:30.200
dissolve into countless lonely particles that won't be able to touch anything else in a strange,

02:30.240 --> 02:41.400
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely. Two, heat death or a big freeze. In a

02:41.400 --> 02:45.640
nutshell, the difference between the big rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario,

02:45.640 --> 02:51.280
matter stays intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period of time into

02:51.280 --> 02:57.640
radiation while the universe expands forever. But how does this work? Let's talk about entropy.

02:57.680 --> 03:03.800
Every system tends towards the state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato.

03:03.800 --> 03:09.440
Initially, it has different regions, but over time they will cool down and disintegrate until

03:09.440 --> 03:15.760
it's uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So while the universe gets bigger

03:15.760 --> 03:23.000
and bigger, matter slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations of stars,

03:23.040 --> 03:31.000
all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted, so the universe will turn dark. The

03:31.000 --> 03:37.720
remaining suns will die. Black holes will slowly degenerate and evaporate over trillions of years

03:37.720 --> 03:45.760
due to what's known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a dilute gas of

03:45.760 --> 03:53.400
photons and light particles remains until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases

03:53.400 --> 04:02.160
at this point. Entropy is at its maximum, and the universe is dead forever. Unless, theoretically,

04:02.160 --> 04:07.080
it might be possible that after an incredibly long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous

04:07.080 --> 04:13.200
entropy decrease as a result of something called quantum tunneling, leading to a new Big Bang.

04:13.200 --> 04:22.240
Three, Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark

04:22.240 --> 04:27.000
energy than we think, or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the

04:27.000 --> 04:31.720
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of expansion of the universe will slow down

04:31.720 --> 04:38.240
and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other, merging as the universe

04:38.240 --> 04:43.280
becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means a hotter universe, temperatures

04:43.280 --> 04:49.440
rise everywhere all at once. 100,000 years before the Big Crunch, background radiation would be

04:49.440 --> 04:53.840
hotter than the surfaces of most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside.

04:53.840 --> 04:59.340
Minutes before the Big Crunch happens, atom cores are ripped apart before supermassive black holes

04:59.340 --> 05:05.520
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would merge into a supermassive mega black hole that

05:05.520 --> 05:10.440
contains the entire mass of the universe, and in the last moment before the Big Crunch,

05:10.440 --> 05:16.860
it would devour the universe, including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this has

05:16.860 --> 05:21.480
happened a lot of times, and that the universe goes through an infinite cycle of expansion and

05:21.480 --> 05:27.840
contraction. Well, wouldn't that be nice? So what will actually happen to the universe in the end?

05:27.840 --> 05:33.920
At the moment, heat death seems the most likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this dead forever

05:34.080 --> 05:40.560
stuff is wrong and the universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way,

05:40.560 --> 05:50.440
so let's just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account.

06:03.920 --> 06:04.000
