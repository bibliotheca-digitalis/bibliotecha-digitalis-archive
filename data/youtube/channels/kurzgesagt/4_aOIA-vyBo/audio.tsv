0	8360	One day the universe will die, but why and how? And will the universe be dead forever?
8360	14760	And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding, and not only that,
14760	21440	the rate of its expansion is accelerating. The reason? Dark energy. Dark energy is a
21440	27760	strange phenomenon that scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998, we thought
27800	32720	that the universe must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up,
32720	38200	but at some point it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe is actually
38200	44760	speeding up. That's like throwing a ball up and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster.
44760	53200	Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don't know, but we call it dark energy. Einstein
53240	59360	thought of it first, and then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have decided it
59360	65000	is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical, and we don't actually know what
65000	70080	the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories, and they lead us to three
70080	84680	scenarios for the end of the universe. One, the big rip. Since its birth, the universe has been
84680	90680	expanding. For unknown reasons, new space is created everywhere equally. The space between
90680	97760	galaxies expands, so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands, but here gravity
97760	103520	is strong enough to keep them together. In the big rip scenario, the expansion accelerates up
103520	108520	to a point where space expands so fast that gravity can't compensate for this effect anymore.
108520	115120	The result is a big rip. At first, only large structures like galaxies are torn apart,
115120	121300	since space between the single objects expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
121300	126560	stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn't strong enough to keep them together, so they
126560	133360	dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand faster than the speed of light. Atoms
133360	138840	would now be affected, and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
138840	144480	no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would
144480	150200	dissolve into countless lonely particles that won't be able to touch anything else in a strange,
150240	161400	timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely. Two, heat death or a big freeze. In a
161400	165640	nutshell, the difference between the big rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario,
165640	171280	matter stays intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period of time into
171280	177640	radiation while the universe expands forever. But how does this work? Let's talk about entropy.
177680	183800	Every system tends towards the state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato.
183800	189440	Initially, it has different regions, but over time they will cool down and disintegrate until
189440	195760	it's uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So while the universe gets bigger
195760	203000	and bigger, matter slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations of stars,
203040	211000	all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted, so the universe will turn dark. The
211000	217720	remaining suns will die. Black holes will slowly degenerate and evaporate over trillions of years
217720	225760	due to what's known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a dilute gas of
225760	233400	photons and light particles remains until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
233400	242160	at this point. Entropy is at its maximum, and the universe is dead forever. Unless, theoretically,
242160	247080	it might be possible that after an incredibly long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous
247080	253200	entropy decrease as a result of something called quantum tunneling, leading to a new Big Bang.
253200	262240	Three, Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark
262240	267000	energy than we think, or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
267000	271720	universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of expansion of the universe will slow down
271720	278240	and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other, merging as the universe
278240	283280	becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means a hotter universe, temperatures
283280	289440	rise everywhere all at once. 100,000 years before the Big Crunch, background radiation would be
289440	293840	hotter than the surfaces of most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside.
293840	299340	Minutes before the Big Crunch happens, atom cores are ripped apart before supermassive black holes
299340	305520	devour everything. Finally, all black holes would merge into a supermassive mega black hole that
305520	310440	contains the entire mass of the universe, and in the last moment before the Big Crunch,
310440	316860	it would devour the universe, including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this has
316860	321480	happened a lot of times, and that the universe goes through an infinite cycle of expansion and
321480	327840	contraction. Well, wouldn't that be nice? So what will actually happen to the universe in the end?
327840	333920	At the moment, heat death seems the most likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this dead forever
334080	340560	stuff is wrong and the universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way,
340560	350440	so let's just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account.
