1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
One day the universe will die, but why and how? And will the universe be dead forever?

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,760
And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding, and not only that,

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,440
the rate of its expansion is accelerating. The reason? Dark energy. Dark energy is a

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,760
strange phenomenon that scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998, we thought

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,720
that the universe must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up,

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,200
but at some point it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe is actually

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,760
speeding up. That's like throwing a ball up and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,200
Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don't know, but we call it dark energy. Einstein

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,360
thought of it first, and then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have decided it

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,000
is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical, and we don't actually know what

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,080
the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories, and they lead us to three

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:24,680
scenarios for the end of the universe. One, the big rip. Since its birth, the universe has been

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,680
expanding. For unknown reasons, new space is created everywhere equally. The space between

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,760
galaxies expands, so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands, but here gravity

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,520
is strong enough to keep them together. In the big rip scenario, the expansion accelerates up

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,520
to a point where space expands so fast that gravity can't compensate for this effect anymore.

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,120
The result is a big rip. At first, only large structures like galaxies are torn apart,

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,300
since space between the single objects expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,560
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn't strong enough to keep them together, so they

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,360
dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand faster than the speed of light. Atoms

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,840
would now be affected, and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,480
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,200
dissolve into countless lonely particles that won't be able to touch anything else in a strange,

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:41,400
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely. Two, heat death or a big freeze. In a

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,640
nutshell, the difference between the big rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario,

26
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,280
matter stays intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period of time into

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,640
radiation while the universe expands forever. But how does this work? Let's talk about entropy.

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,800
Every system tends towards the state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato.

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,440
Initially, it has different regions, but over time they will cool down and disintegrate until

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,760
it's uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So while the universe gets bigger

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,000
and bigger, matter slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations of stars,

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:31,000
all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted, so the universe will turn dark. The

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,720
remaining suns will die. Black holes will slowly degenerate and evaporate over trillions of years

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,760
due to what's known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a dilute gas of

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,400
photons and light particles remains until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:02,160
at this point. Entropy is at its maximum, and the universe is dead forever. Unless, theoretically,

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,080
it might be possible that after an incredibly long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,200
entropy decrease as a result of something called quantum tunneling, leading to a new Big Bang.

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:22,240
Three, Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,000
energy than we think, or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,720
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of expansion of the universe will slow down

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,240
and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other, merging as the universe

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means a hotter universe, temperatures

44
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,440
rise everywhere all at once. 100,000 years before the Big Crunch, background radiation would be

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,840
hotter than the surfaces of most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside.

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,340
Minutes before the Big Crunch happens, atom cores are ripped apart before supermassive black holes

47
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,520
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would merge into a supermassive mega black hole that

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,440
contains the entire mass of the universe, and in the last moment before the Big Crunch,

49
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,860
it would devour the universe, including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this has

50
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,480
happened a lot of times, and that the universe goes through an infinite cycle of expansion and

51
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,840
contraction. Well, wouldn't that be nice? So what will actually happen to the universe in the end?

52
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,920
At the moment, heat death seems the most likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this dead forever

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,560
stuff is wrong and the universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way,

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:50,440
so let's just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account.

55
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,000
