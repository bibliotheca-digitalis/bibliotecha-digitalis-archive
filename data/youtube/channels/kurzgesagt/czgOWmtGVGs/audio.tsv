0	13000	Humans have existed for millions of years as part of nature, but then something changed and in an incredibly short amount of time, we terraformed this planet and designed it to fit our needs.
14000	20000	As far as we know, we're the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet.
20000	29000	The transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building was so breathtakingly fast that many of our ways of thinking about the world are no longer useful.
29000	38000	One of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used calendar in the world insists that we live in the year 2016.
38000	48000	This distorts our view of our own history and makes it harder to understand who we are as a species, and just how far we've come in an incredibly short amount of time.
48000	52000	So maybe it's time to choose a year zero for humanity.
52000	57000	A year zero that truly represents us as a species and includes all cultures.
57000	63000	A year zero that marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one.
76000	81000	12,000 years ago, hundreds of humans came together in the hills of southern Anatolia.
82000	86000	They were hunters and gatherers without knowledge of agriculture or metalworking.
86000	89000	All they had were tools made of stone and wood.
89000	96000	But they built humanity's first big construction project, 7,000 years before the pyramids were built in Egypt.
96000	106000	Spread over 300 meters, our ancestors erected circles of massive stone pillars, each of them up to 6 meters high and 40 tons in weight.
106000	111000	Decorated with artful pictograms and stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.
111000	115000	We have no idea how they were able to do this.
115000	125000	It was probably a project of epic scale for the Stone Age, requiring a level of organization we didn't know early humans were capable of until we found this site.
125000	128000	So, why did they build it?
128000	135000	The most popular theory is that this was the first temple of humanity, dedicated to long-forgotten gods.
136000	142000	We only know that this construction project, the first of its kind, marks the beginning of a new era.
142000	148000	It's in this area, around that time, that humans truly began to build their own world.
148000	154000	Which would make it a fitting milestone in our history for the start of our calendar.
154000	168000	This moment in time is so distinct that scientist Cesare Emiliani proposed that humanity should switch to what he called the Holocene calendar by adding 10,000 years to our current Gregorian calendar.
168000	174000	We don't need to change our well-established days and months, and religious calendars could stay the same as well.
174000	181000	But for all official purposes, our current year would be the year 12,016 of the human era.
181000	186000	This would drastically alter how we think about history and how it feels.
186000	193000	Let's take a very brief look and move through our new history from our new year zero.
196000	201000	12,000 years ago saw the beginning of the first construction project kicking off our history.
201000	204000	It would be in use for about 2,000 years.
204000	213000	It took nearly a millennium until Jericho, probably the first city on Earth, was founded in the year 1000 after the start of the human era.
213000	216000	Progress was still very, very slow at this point.
216000	226000	Over the next thousand years, more and more permanent settlements appeared around the world, and more and more plants and animals were domesticated as agriculture spread.
226000	231000	Evidence for trade over thousands of kilometers has been found from this period.
231000	237000	Around 5 million humans were alive at this point in history, fewer than live in London today.
237000	243000	Technology advanced constantly at a slow pace. Pottery became widespread.
243000	248000	The first cultural communities appeared in China, India, and the Fertile Crescent.
248000	255000	Around the year 4000, 8000 years ago from today, humans started to use metal for the first time,
255000	261000	learning to mix tin and copper, and kick-starting what we know as the Bronze Age around the year 5000.
261000	266000	The first proto-writing emerged, and the wheel was invented.
266000	274000	In South America, the Chinchorro culture started to artificially mummify humans 2,000 years earlier than in ancient Egypt.
274000	278000	The first high cultures began emerging around the year 7000.
278000	288000	The Indus Valley Civilization, ancient Egypt, the Minoans in Greece, and the Sumerians in Mesopotamia.
288000	293000	Stonehenge was built in Britain, and the First Dynasty in China began.
293000	296000	Ã–tzi the Iceman lived around this time.
296000	304000	What we consider history now started, and things began picking up pace as the world population rose to over 30 million.
304000	310000	A number of new high cultures appeared around the world, many writing down their legends.
310000	316000	More and more cities were founded. In South America, the Olmec culture emerged.
316000	320000	Around this time, the legendary Siege of Troy is supposed to have happened.
320000	326000	Soon after, in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Fertile Crescent, the Bronze Age ended in violence.
326000	331000	Every Bronze Age culture, except Egypt, was destroyed by mysterious invaders.
331000	334000	Writing and progress froze for hundreds of years.
334000	339000	Around the year 9500, what we consider Western culture began.
339000	348000	The Greek city-states beat off the Persian invasion and triggered their golden era, ended by Alexander the Great around 9700.
348000	355000	100 years later, Rome destroyed Carthage and became a dominant force in the world.
356000	364000	Caesar was murdered in the year 9956, while the world population had risen to about 300 million people.
366000	375000	And it's only now, around the year 10,000, that we've reached the point where the Gregorian calendar and our current method of marking human history begins.
375000	380000	A mere 2,000 years from now, humans will walk on the Moon.
380000	388000	If we think about history as we do now, we are underplaying 10,000 years of human progress and development.
388000	393000	Including all of it in our calendar makes our past more impressive.
393000	401000	It shows how progress became exponential with time, and it incorporates all humans from all cultures into our calendar.
401000	407000	A new year zero for our history could reframe how we think of ourselves.
407000	417000	As a building project that started 12,000 years ago, when for the first time our ancestors came together to carve a temple out of bedrock with tools made of stone.
417000	423000	Not knowing what they would set in motion, where it would lead us as a species.
423000	428000	From building the first temple to ships flying beyond the sky.
429000	435000	We've made a Kurzgesagt version of the human era calendar that you can buy here if you want.
435000	439000	It's a calendar for 2017, but with one important difference.
439000	445000	It's for the year 12,017. The year we think we should be in right now.
445000	453000	There are only a very limited amount available, but if we sell enough of them, we'll make this a regular thing and maybe produce more print products in the future.
453000	457000	The calendar is illustrated, and we put in a few fun facts.
457000	465000	Also, as always, if you like what we do, please consider supporting us on Patreon or buying things we made. It really helps.
465000	470000	Thanks, and have a happy 12,017.
