00:00.000 --> 00:05.420
Today, we are answering an age-old, very scientific, and important question.

00:05.420 --> 00:08.120
What if the Moon crashes into Earth?

00:08.120 --> 00:12.520
It's more interesting and weird than you probably think.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.720
Let's start with the basics.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.020
Why isn't the Moon on its way to crash into us already?

00:25.020 --> 00:29.420
We know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon,

00:29.420 --> 00:34.420
but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force.

00:34.420 --> 00:37.120
But there is no other force countering gravity.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.920
Instead, the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.420
You see orbits every day.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.420
When you throw a ball, it makes a tiny little orbit.

00:47.420 --> 00:53.420
The only difference between the ball's orbit and the Moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.920
Basically, the reason is speed.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.420
If you could throw your ball fast enough, it would bend around the world and come back to you.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.420
If there were no air slowing it down, it could orbit forever.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.420
And this is what the Moon does.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.920
Falling sideways around Earth, very fast, with no air slowing it down.

01:11.920 --> 01:17.420
Orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3600 kilometers an hour.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.920
So, for the Moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth,

01:20.920 --> 01:24.420
would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain.

01:24.420 --> 01:27.420
So, how do we crash it into Earth?

01:27.420 --> 01:31.920
In a nutshell, to change an object's orbit, you need to change its speed,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.920
which changes where gravity takes it.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.920
But even small changes require enormous forces,

01:37.920 --> 01:42.920
which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.420
According to science, the Moon is big and very massive.

01:46.420 --> 01:51.920
Even igniting billions of rocket engines all over its surface would barely move the Moon.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.420
It looks like nothing short of magic will make the Moon fall,

01:55.420 --> 01:58.920
so we'll use a magic spell that slows down the Moon so much,

01:58.920 --> 02:02.920
that it changes its orbit and spirals towards Earth.

02:02.920 --> 02:08.920
To get the most from the experience, the Moon will take exactly one year before it hits Earth.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
Ready?

02:09.920 --> 02:13.920
Three, two, one.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.920
Magic.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.420
Month one.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.920
For the first few days, nothing really changes.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.420
The Moon gets a tiny bit brighter and scientists get confused,

02:24.420 --> 02:27.420
but the rest of us don't notice anything different.

02:27.420 --> 02:31.420
The only noticeable real effect of the Moon on the Earth are the tides.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.920
Tides exist because while Earth pulls on the Moon,

02:33.920 --> 02:36.920
the Moon's gravity pulls back on the Earth.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.420
Since the strength of gravity gets weaker with distance,

02:39.420 --> 02:42.920
different parts of the Earth feel a slightly different pull,

02:42.920 --> 02:44.920
which causes the Earth, especially the oceans,

02:44.920 --> 02:49.920
to bulge when the Moon is above them and contract a little on the sides when it's not.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.420
As Earth rotates every day underneath the Moon,

02:52.420 --> 02:53.920
the Moon's influence fluctuates,

02:53.920 --> 02:59.420
causing the water level of the oceans to rise and fall by about half a meter twice a day.

02:59.420 --> 03:04.420
But with the Moon drawing ever closer, high tide gets higher every day.

03:04.420 --> 03:05.920
At first barely noticeable,

03:05.920 --> 03:08.920
within a month the Moon has covered half the distance to the Earth,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.920
and ocean tides have grown to four meters.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.920
Every day high tide comes and waves flood coastal cities.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.420
And there's no end in sight.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.920
With the Moon drawing ever closer, tides rise ever higher,

03:21.920 --> 03:27.420
inundating another city and more inhabited land with salty water every day.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.420
By the end of month two, the Moon has covered two-thirds of the distance to Earth,

03:34.420 --> 03:38.920
and global infrastructure is crumbling as tides rise above ten meters,

03:38.920 --> 03:43.420
displacing up to a billion people who happen to live near the coastlines.

03:43.420 --> 03:47.420
As ports become inoperable, shipping grinds to a halt.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.920
Not only will it slow down the delivery of Kurzgesagt products,

03:50.920 --> 03:53.420
but also less exciting things like food.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.420
Global communications fall into disarray.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.920
95% of the Internet is carried by ocean-crossing cables,

03:59.920 --> 04:04.920
and while these largely don't mind the water, their terminals on land do.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.920
Living inland doesn't guarantee safety either.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.420
Tidal boards cause rivers to flow backwards,

04:10.420 --> 04:14.920
carrying salt water to contaminate surface and groundwater supplies.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.420
Gas shortages follow as oil refineries near the coast are abandoned.

04:19.420 --> 04:22.420
Countries are left with the supplies they had on their shelves,

04:22.420 --> 04:25.420
and strict rationing will begin.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.420
In the cities, chaos reigns during the scavenging hours of low tide,

04:29.420 --> 04:33.920
while survivors take refuge in high-rises when the water returns.

04:35.920 --> 04:41.420
Three months in, and the Moon is close enough to disrupt communication and navigation satellites.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.920
While it's normally far too distant for its gravity to cause any major problems for our satellites,

04:45.920 --> 04:49.920
the closer it gets, the more warped their orbits become.

04:49.920 --> 04:55.920
As their fuel for orbital corrections runs out, satellites careen out of control.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.920
Months 4 and 5.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.420
On Earth, the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 meters,

05:03.420 --> 05:07.920
and will be reaching 100 meters in height in a few short weeks.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.920
At low tide, the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometers,

05:10.920 --> 05:13.920
exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts,

05:13.920 --> 05:19.420
while at high tide, walls of water drown agriculture, houses, and skyscrapers.

05:19.420 --> 05:24.920
And now, almost five months in, the apocalypse has finished its warm-up act.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.420
Since the oceans are on average only three kilometers deep,

05:28.420 --> 05:30.420
the tides have reached their maximum.

05:30.420 --> 05:33.420
Up until now, the water in the oceans could flow,

05:33.420 --> 05:36.420
absorbing most of the Moon's gravitational squeezing,

05:36.420 --> 05:41.420
but now the Earth itself is really feeling the squeeze of the ever-approaching Moon.

05:41.420 --> 05:45.920
These aren't so much tides of water, but tides of rock.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.920
The squeezing of the planet, combined with the weight of quintillions of tons of water

05:49.920 --> 05:54.420
sloshing on and off the tectonic plate, creates enormous stresses below,

05:54.420 --> 05:58.920
and begins to cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and intensity.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.420
It's impossible to say how serious these earthquakes might be or where they occur,

06:03.420 --> 06:05.920
but like a child jumping on their bed until it breaks,

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
no good can come of it.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.920
Strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.420
On Earth, squeezing the planet disrupts the magma reservoirs inside the crust,

06:16.420 --> 06:23.420
triggering sizable, climate-altering eruptions in Chile, New Zealand, Yellowstone, and elsewhere.

06:23.420 --> 06:27.920
Meanwhile, watching patiently above is the Moon.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.920
Still no bigger in the sky than a small cloud.

06:30.920 --> 06:37.420
Within 75,000 kilometers of Earth, it is bright enough to illuminate the night sky like twilight.

06:37.420 --> 06:39.920
Months 6 and 7.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.920
After half a year, the Moon is entering the space once occupied by geosynchronous satellites,

06:44.920 --> 06:47.920
where it orbits Earth every 24 hours.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.920
It appears to float at one spot in the sky, unmoving,

06:50.920 --> 06:56.420
cycling through a full set of phases every day, but only visible to half the planet.

06:56.420 --> 07:01.420
With the Moon stationary above the Earth, the tides seem to freeze in place.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.920
Half the world flooded, half with its water seemingly returned to the sea,

07:05.920 --> 07:09.420
as if Earth is holding its breath to prepare for the worst.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.920
As the Moon sinks further, you might wonder if its gravity would overpower Earth's,

07:13.920 --> 07:16.420
pulling you up and ending your misery.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.420
Fortunately not.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.920
The Earth's surface gravity is about six times stronger than the Moon's,

07:21.920 --> 07:27.420
so even if the Moon were hovering right on top of you, you would still stay on the ground.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.420
On the Moon, things are different though.

07:29.420 --> 07:32.920
The near side of the Moon is more strongly affected by Earth's gravity,

07:32.920 --> 07:38.420
so during the next few months, it starts to stretch forward towards the Earth into something of an egg,

07:38.420 --> 07:42.920
triggering deep moonquakes as the lunar rock flexes and changes shape.

07:42.920 --> 07:49.920
Though barely noticeable now, this squish will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
Months 8 to 11.

07:51.920 --> 07:57.420
At this point, the apocalypse has arrived, and we can summarize the months before the crash,

07:57.420 --> 08:00.920
as everybody left has a really bad time.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.420
The tides sweeping over the Earth slow down and then reverse their direction,

08:05.420 --> 08:09.920
because the Moon now orbits Earth faster than it rotates.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.420
The planet will experience an abundance of earthquakes and volcanism.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.920
Massive amounts of volcanic aerosols rise high into the stratosphere,

08:17.920 --> 08:20.920
shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space.

08:20.920 --> 08:26.420
What little light gets through is rust red and is periodically diminished by daily eclipses.

08:26.420 --> 08:32.920
The result is a rapid global cooling, with acid rains and summer snows killing even the hardiest plants.

08:32.920 --> 08:35.920
The clock runs out on civilization.

08:35.920 --> 08:40.420
Billions have perished, while an X-shaped Moon is still drawing closer.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.420
Let's get ready for the grand finale.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.420
Month 12.

08:45.420 --> 08:49.920
Finally, at the end of the year, the Moon has reached the Roche limit.

08:49.920 --> 08:56.420
That's the point where Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon is stronger than the Moon's own gravity.

08:56.420 --> 09:01.420
Things on the lunar surface start falling towards Earth, and by the time it crosses 10,000 kilometers,

09:01.420 --> 09:08.420
the entire Moon disintegrates into rubble, smearing itself into a massive ring system around the Earth.

09:08.420 --> 09:13.420
Fortunately, the Moon's disintegration means the misery on Earth has ended.

09:13.420 --> 09:18.420
No Moon means the general apocalyptic nature of things comes to a halt.

09:18.420 --> 09:22.920
The oceans recede, flowing off the land one last time.

09:22.920 --> 09:28.420
Any survivors are treated to a view of tremendous arches spanning the sky,

09:28.420 --> 09:33.920
glimmering in the sunlight, illuminating the night sky more brilliantly than any full Moon ever could,

09:33.920 --> 09:37.420
while meteor showers of Moon dust fill the sky.

09:37.420 --> 09:41.920
It's hard to say what happens next, but the tranquility may be short-lived.

09:41.920 --> 09:47.920
If too much Moon dust rains down, friction heats the atmosphere, possibly boiling the oceans.

09:47.920 --> 09:54.420
If not, the enormous shadows cast by the rings, combined with all the volcanic and meteoric aerosols,

09:54.420 --> 10:02.420
block even more sunlight, and a period of runaway cooling could begin that freezes much of Earth's surface solid.

10:04.420 --> 10:11.420
In any case, at some point, people will emerge again, from submarines or bunkers or mountaintops.

10:11.920 --> 10:18.420
They will not have a great time before rebuilding civilization, and their success is not guaranteed,

10:18.420 --> 10:22.920
but at least they'll be trying to do so with beautiful rings in the sky.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.420
So, how do you calculate that sort of thing?

10:30.420 --> 10:33.920
Well, you just need a bit of insanity and some maths.

10:33.920 --> 10:40.920
If you need to brush up on the latter, our friends from Brilliant are the perfect coaches to turn your curiosity into practical skills.

10:40.920 --> 10:46.420
