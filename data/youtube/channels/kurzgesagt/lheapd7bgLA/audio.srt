00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Today, we are answering an age-old, very scientific, and important question.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,120
What if the Moon crashes into Earth?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,520
It's more interesting and weird than you probably think.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's start with the basics.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,020
Why isn't the Moon on its way to crash into us already?

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,420
We know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon,

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,420
but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force.

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,120
But there is no other force countering gravity.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,920
Instead, the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,420
You see orbits every day.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,420
When you throw a ball, it makes a tiny little orbit.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,420
The only difference between the ball's orbit and the Moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,920
Basically, the reason is speed.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,420
If you could throw your ball fast enough, it would bend around the world and come back to you.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,420
If there were no air slowing it down, it could orbit forever.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,420
And this is what the Moon does.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,920
Falling sideways around Earth, very fast, with no air slowing it down.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,420
Orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3600 kilometers an hour.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,920
So, for the Moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth,

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,420
would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain.

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,420
So, how do we crash it into Earth?

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,920
In a nutshell, to change an object's orbit, you need to change its speed,

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,920
which changes where gravity takes it.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,920
But even small changes require enormous forces,

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,420
According to science, the Moon is big and very massive.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,920
Even igniting billions of rocket engines all over its surface would barely move the Moon.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,420
It looks like nothing short of magic will make the Moon fall,

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,920
so we'll use a magic spell that slows down the Moon so much,

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,920
that it changes its orbit and spirals towards Earth.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,920
To get the most from the experience, the Moon will take exactly one year before it hits Earth.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Ready?

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Three, two, one.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Magic.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,420
Month one.

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,920
For the first few days, nothing really changes.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,420
The Moon gets a tiny bit brighter and scientists get confused,

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,420
but the rest of us don't notice anything different.

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,420
The only noticeable real effect of the Moon on the Earth are the tides.

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,920
Tides exist because while Earth pulls on the Moon,

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,920
the Moon's gravity pulls back on the Earth.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,420
Since the strength of gravity gets weaker with distance,

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,920
different parts of the Earth feel a slightly different pull,

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
which causes the Earth, especially the oceans,

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,920
to bulge when the Moon is above them and contract a little on the sides when it's not.

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,420
As Earth rotates every day underneath the Moon,

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,920
the Moon's influence fluctuates,

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,420
causing the water level of the oceans to rise and fall by about half a meter twice a day.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,420
But with the Moon drawing ever closer, high tide gets higher every day.

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,920
At first barely noticeable,

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,920
within a month the Moon has covered half the distance to the Earth,

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,920
and ocean tides have grown to four meters.

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Every day high tide comes and waves flood coastal cities.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,420
And there's no end in sight.

55
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,920
With the Moon drawing ever closer, tides rise ever higher,

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,420
inundating another city and more inhabited land with salty water every day.

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,420
By the end of month two, the Moon has covered two-thirds of the distance to Earth,

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,920
and global infrastructure is crumbling as tides rise above ten meters,

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,420
displacing up to a billion people who happen to live near the coastlines.

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,420
As ports become inoperable, shipping grinds to a halt.

61
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,920
Not only will it slow down the delivery of Kurzgesagt products,

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,420
but also less exciting things like food.

63
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,420
Global communications fall into disarray.

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,920
95% of the Internet is carried by ocean-crossing cables,

65
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,920
and while these largely don't mind the water, their terminals on land do.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Living inland doesn't guarantee safety either.

67
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,420
Tidal boards cause rivers to flow backwards,

68
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,920
carrying salt water to contaminate surface and groundwater supplies.

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,420
Gas shortages follow as oil refineries near the coast are abandoned.

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Countries are left with the supplies they had on their shelves,

71
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,420
and strict rationing will begin.

72
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,420
In the cities, chaos reigns during the scavenging hours of low tide,

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,920
while survivors take refuge in high-rises when the water returns.

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,420
Three months in, and the Moon is close enough to disrupt communication and navigation satellites.

75
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,920
While it's normally far too distant for its gravity to cause any major problems for our satellites,

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
the closer it gets, the more warped their orbits become.

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,920
As their fuel for orbital corrections runs out, satellites careen out of control.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Months 4 and 5.

79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,420
On Earth, the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 meters,

80
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,920
and will be reaching 100 meters in height in a few short weeks.

81
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
At low tide, the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometers,

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,920
exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts,

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,420
while at high tide, walls of water drown agriculture, houses, and skyscrapers.

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,920
And now, almost five months in, the apocalypse has finished its warm-up act.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,420
Since the oceans are on average only three kilometers deep,

86
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
the tides have reached their maximum.

87
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,420
Up until now, the water in the oceans could flow,

88
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
absorbing most of the Moon's gravitational squeezing,

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,420
but now the Earth itself is really feeling the squeeze of the ever-approaching Moon.

90
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,920
These aren't so much tides of water, but tides of rock.

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,920
The squeezing of the planet, combined with the weight of quintillions of tons of water

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,420
sloshing on and off the tectonic plate, creates enormous stresses below,

93
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,920
and begins to cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and intensity.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,420
It's impossible to say how serious these earthquakes might be or where they occur,

95
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,920
but like a child jumping on their bed until it breaks,

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
no good can come of it.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons.

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,420
On Earth, squeezing the planet disrupts the magma reservoirs inside the crust,

99
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:23,420
triggering sizable, climate-altering eruptions in Chile, New Zealand, Yellowstone, and elsewhere.

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,920
Meanwhile, watching patiently above is the Moon.

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Still no bigger in the sky than a small cloud.

102
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,420
Within 75,000 kilometers of Earth, it is bright enough to illuminate the night sky like twilight.

103
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,920
Months 6 and 7.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,920
After half a year, the Moon is entering the space once occupied by geosynchronous satellites,

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
where it orbits Earth every 24 hours.

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
It appears to float at one spot in the sky, unmoving,

107
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,420
cycling through a full set of phases every day, but only visible to half the planet.

108
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,420
With the Moon stationary above the Earth, the tides seem to freeze in place.

109
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,920
Half the world flooded, half with its water seemingly returned to the sea,

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,420
as if Earth is holding its breath to prepare for the worst.

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,920
As the Moon sinks further, you might wonder if its gravity would overpower Earth's,

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,420
pulling you up and ending your misery.

113
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Fortunately not.

114
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,920
The Earth's surface gravity is about six times stronger than the Moon's,

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,420
so even if the Moon were hovering right on top of you, you would still stay on the ground.

116
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
On the Moon, things are different though.

117
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,920
The near side of the Moon is more strongly affected by Earth's gravity,

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,420
so during the next few months, it starts to stretch forward towards the Earth into something of an egg,

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,920
triggering deep moonquakes as the lunar rock flexes and changes shape.

120
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Though barely noticeable now, this squish will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months.

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Months 8 to 11.

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,420
At this point, the apocalypse has arrived, and we can summarize the months before the crash,

123
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,920
as everybody left has a really bad time.

124
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,420
The tides sweeping over the Earth slow down and then reverse their direction,

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,920
because the Moon now orbits Earth faster than it rotates.

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,420
The planet will experience an abundance of earthquakes and volcanism.

127
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,920
Massive amounts of volcanic aerosols rise high into the stratosphere,

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,920
shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space.

129
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,420
What little light gets through is rust red and is periodically diminished by daily eclipses.

130
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,920
The result is a rapid global cooling, with acid rains and summer snows killing even the hardiest plants.

131
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
The clock runs out on civilization.

132
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,420
Billions have perished, while an X-shaped Moon is still drawing closer.

133
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,420
Let's get ready for the grand finale.

134
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Month 12.

135
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,920
Finally, at the end of the year, the Moon has reached the Roche limit.

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,420
That's the point where Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon is stronger than the Moon's own gravity.

137
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Things on the lunar surface start falling towards Earth, and by the time it crosses 10,000 kilometers,

138
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,420
the entire Moon disintegrates into rubble, smearing itself into a massive ring system around the Earth.

139
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Fortunately, the Moon's disintegration means the misery on Earth has ended.

140
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,420
No Moon means the general apocalyptic nature of things comes to a halt.

141
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,920
The oceans recede, flowing off the land one last time.

142
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,420
Any survivors are treated to a view of tremendous arches spanning the sky,

143
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,920
glimmering in the sunlight, illuminating the night sky more brilliantly than any full Moon ever could,

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,420
while meteor showers of Moon dust fill the sky.

145
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,920
It's hard to say what happens next, but the tranquility may be short-lived.

146
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,920
If too much Moon dust rains down, friction heats the atmosphere, possibly boiling the oceans.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,420
If not, the enormous shadows cast by the rings, combined with all the volcanic and meteoric aerosols,

148
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,420
block even more sunlight, and a period of runaway cooling could begin that freezes much of Earth's surface solid.

149
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:11,420
In any case, at some point, people will emerge again, from submarines or bunkers or mountaintops.

150
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,420
They will not have a great time before rebuilding civilization, and their success is not guaranteed,

151
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,920
but at least they'll be trying to do so with beautiful rings in the sky.

152
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,420
So, how do you calculate that sort of thing?

153
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,920
Well, you just need a bit of insanity and some maths.

154
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,920
If you need to brush up on the latter, our friends from Brilliant are the perfect coaches to turn your curiosity into practical skills.

155
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,420
Brilliant is a problem-solving website and app that makes science accessible with a hands-on approach.

156
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,920
More than 60 interactive courses like The Joy of Problem Solving or Scientific Thinking

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,420
give you the tools to crack problems in maths, science, and computer science

158
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,420
in a way that feels more like playing a game than doing homework.

159
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,920
Lessons will surprise you with storytelling, code-writing tasks, and interactive challenges,

160
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
basically using whatever keeps you interested and entertained.

161
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
All the content is interactive.

162
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Instead of just reading and listening to explanations,

163
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,420
you drag and drop, manipulate shapes and diagrams, make selections, and answer questions.

164
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,420
This way, you learn something almost without you noticing it.

165
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:29,420
And tiny step-by-step, you'll build up your long-term understanding of science and get closer to your STEM goals.

166
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,420
To start looking at the world of science from a different perspective,

167
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,420
go to brilliant.org slash Nutshell and sign up for free.

168
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,920
When there's an extra perk for Kurzgesagt viewers,

169
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,420
the first 200 people to use the link get 20% off their annual membership,

170
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,920
which unlocks all of Brilliant's courses in maths, science, and computer science.

171
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,920
At Kurzgesagt, we love to create things that seem impossible at first.

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Brilliant can help you acquire the skills to do that.

173
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,420
This year, we'll release three very special limited edition pins.

174
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,920
The first one is this very shiny Mooncrash pin set.

175
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,420
Pre-order is available for only 72 hours, so you can order it now and then, never again.

176
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Be sure to watch out for pin number two and three to complete your 12,022 collection.
