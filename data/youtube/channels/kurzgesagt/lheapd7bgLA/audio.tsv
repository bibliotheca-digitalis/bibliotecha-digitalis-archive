0	5420	Today, we are answering an age-old, very scientific, and important question.
5420	8120	What if the Moon crashes into Earth?
8120	12520	It's more interesting and weird than you probably think.
12520	14720	Let's start with the basics.
14720	18020	Why isn't the Moon on its way to crash into us already?
25020	29420	We know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it, including the Moon,
29420	34420	but somehow, it stays up, as if suspended by some opposite force.
34420	37120	But there is no other force countering gravity.
37120	42920	Instead, the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit.
42920	44420	You see orbits every day.
44420	47420	When you throw a ball, it makes a tiny little orbit.
47420	53420	The only difference between the ball's orbit and the Moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground.
53420	56920	Basically, the reason is speed.
56920	61420	If you could throw your ball fast enough, it would bend around the world and come back to you.
61420	65420	If there were no air slowing it down, it could orbit forever.
65420	67420	And this is what the Moon does.
67420	71920	Falling sideways around Earth, very fast, with no air slowing it down.
71920	77420	Orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3600 kilometers an hour.
77420	80920	So, for the Moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth,
80920	84420	would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain.
84420	87420	So, how do we crash it into Earth?
87420	91920	In a nutshell, to change an object's orbit, you need to change its speed,
91920	94920	which changes where gravity takes it.
94920	97920	But even small changes require enormous forces,
97920	102920	which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays.
102920	106420	According to science, the Moon is big and very massive.
106420	111920	Even igniting billions of rocket engines all over its surface would barely move the Moon.
111920	115420	It looks like nothing short of magic will make the Moon fall,
115420	118920	so we'll use a magic spell that slows down the Moon so much,
118920	122920	that it changes its orbit and spirals towards Earth.
122920	128920	To get the most from the experience, the Moon will take exactly one year before it hits Earth.
128920	129920	Ready?
129920	133920	Three, two, one.
133920	135920	Magic.
135920	138420	Month one.
138420	140920	For the first few days, nothing really changes.
140920	144420	The Moon gets a tiny bit brighter and scientists get confused,
144420	147420	but the rest of us don't notice anything different.
147420	151420	The only noticeable real effect of the Moon on the Earth are the tides.
151420	153920	Tides exist because while Earth pulls on the Moon,
153920	156920	the Moon's gravity pulls back on the Earth.
156920	159420	Since the strength of gravity gets weaker with distance,
159420	162920	different parts of the Earth feel a slightly different pull,
162920	164920	which causes the Earth, especially the oceans,
164920	169920	to bulge when the Moon is above them and contract a little on the sides when it's not.
169920	172420	As Earth rotates every day underneath the Moon,
172420	173920	the Moon's influence fluctuates,
173920	179420	causing the water level of the oceans to rise and fall by about half a meter twice a day.
179420	184420	But with the Moon drawing ever closer, high tide gets higher every day.
184420	185920	At first barely noticeable,
185920	188920	within a month the Moon has covered half the distance to the Earth,
188920	191920	and ocean tides have grown to four meters.
191920	195920	Every day high tide comes and waves flood coastal cities.
195920	198420	And there's no end in sight.
198420	201920	With the Moon drawing ever closer, tides rise ever higher,
201920	207420	inundating another city and more inhabited land with salty water every day.
210420	214420	By the end of month two, the Moon has covered two-thirds of the distance to Earth,
214420	218920	and global infrastructure is crumbling as tides rise above ten meters,
218920	223420	displacing up to a billion people who happen to live near the coastlines.
223420	227420	As ports become inoperable, shipping grinds to a halt.
227420	230920	Not only will it slow down the delivery of Kurzgesagt products,
230920	233420	but also less exciting things like food.
233420	236420	Global communications fall into disarray.
236420	239920	95% of the Internet is carried by ocean-crossing cables,
239920	244920	and while these largely don't mind the water, their terminals on land do.
244920	247920	Living inland doesn't guarantee safety either.
247920	250420	Tidal boards cause rivers to flow backwards,
250420	254920	carrying salt water to contaminate surface and groundwater supplies.
254920	259420	Gas shortages follow as oil refineries near the coast are abandoned.
259420	262420	Countries are left with the supplies they had on their shelves,
262420	265420	and strict rationing will begin.
265420	269420	In the cities, chaos reigns during the scavenging hours of low tide,
269420	273920	while survivors take refuge in high-rises when the water returns.
275920	281420	Three months in, and the Moon is close enough to disrupt communication and navigation satellites.
281420	285920	While it's normally far too distant for its gravity to cause any major problems for our satellites,
285920	289920	the closer it gets, the more warped their orbits become.
289920	295920	As their fuel for orbital corrections runs out, satellites careen out of control.
295920	297920	Months 4 and 5.
299420	303420	On Earth, the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 meters,
303420	307920	and will be reaching 100 meters in height in a few short weeks.
307920	310920	At low tide, the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometers,
310920	313920	exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts,
313920	319420	while at high tide, walls of water drown agriculture, houses, and skyscrapers.
319420	324920	And now, almost five months in, the apocalypse has finished its warm-up act.
324920	328420	Since the oceans are on average only three kilometers deep,
328420	330420	the tides have reached their maximum.
330420	333420	Up until now, the water in the oceans could flow,
333420	336420	absorbing most of the Moon's gravitational squeezing,
336420	341420	but now the Earth itself is really feeling the squeeze of the ever-approaching Moon.
341420	345920	These aren't so much tides of water, but tides of rock.
345920	349920	The squeezing of the planet, combined with the weight of quintillions of tons of water
349920	354420	sloshing on and off the tectonic plate, creates enormous stresses below,
354420	358920	and begins to cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and intensity.
358920	363420	It's impossible to say how serious these earthquakes might be or where they occur,
363420	365920	but like a child jumping on their bed until it breaks,
365920	367920	no good can come of it.
367920	371920	Strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons.
371920	376420	On Earth, squeezing the planet disrupts the magma reservoirs inside the crust,
376420	383420	triggering sizable, climate-altering eruptions in Chile, New Zealand, Yellowstone, and elsewhere.
383420	387920	Meanwhile, watching patiently above is the Moon.
387920	390920	Still no bigger in the sky than a small cloud.
390920	397420	Within 75,000 kilometers of Earth, it is bright enough to illuminate the night sky like twilight.
397420	399920	Months 6 and 7.
399920	404920	After half a year, the Moon is entering the space once occupied by geosynchronous satellites,
404920	407920	where it orbits Earth every 24 hours.
407920	410920	It appears to float at one spot in the sky, unmoving,
410920	416420	cycling through a full set of phases every day, but only visible to half the planet.
416420	421420	With the Moon stationary above the Earth, the tides seem to freeze in place.
421420	425920	Half the world flooded, half with its water seemingly returned to the sea,
425920	429420	as if Earth is holding its breath to prepare for the worst.
429420	433920	As the Moon sinks further, you might wonder if its gravity would overpower Earth's,
433920	436420	pulling you up and ending your misery.
436420	438420	Fortunately not.
438420	441920	The Earth's surface gravity is about six times stronger than the Moon's,
441920	447420	so even if the Moon were hovering right on top of you, you would still stay on the ground.
447420	449420	On the Moon, things are different though.
449420	452920	The near side of the Moon is more strongly affected by Earth's gravity,
452920	458420	so during the next few months, it starts to stretch forward towards the Earth into something of an egg,
458420	462920	triggering deep moonquakes as the lunar rock flexes and changes shape.
462920	469920	Though barely noticeable now, this squish will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months.
469920	471920	Months 8 to 11.
471920	477420	At this point, the apocalypse has arrived, and we can summarize the months before the crash,
477420	480920	as everybody left has a really bad time.
480920	485420	The tides sweeping over the Earth slow down and then reverse their direction,
485420	489920	because the Moon now orbits Earth faster than it rotates.
489920	494420	The planet will experience an abundance of earthquakes and volcanism.
494420	497920	Massive amounts of volcanic aerosols rise high into the stratosphere,
497920	500920	shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space.
500920	506420	What little light gets through is rust red and is periodically diminished by daily eclipses.
506420	512920	The result is a rapid global cooling, with acid rains and summer snows killing even the hardiest plants.
512920	515920	The clock runs out on civilization.
515920	520420	Billions have perished, while an X-shaped Moon is still drawing closer.
520420	523420	Let's get ready for the grand finale.
523420	525420	Month 12.
525420	529920	Finally, at the end of the year, the Moon has reached the Roche limit.
529920	536420	That's the point where Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon is stronger than the Moon's own gravity.
536420	541420	Things on the lunar surface start falling towards Earth, and by the time it crosses 10,000 kilometers,
541420	548420	the entire Moon disintegrates into rubble, smearing itself into a massive ring system around the Earth.
548420	553420	Fortunately, the Moon's disintegration means the misery on Earth has ended.
553420	558420	No Moon means the general apocalyptic nature of things comes to a halt.
558420	562920	The oceans recede, flowing off the land one last time.
562920	568420	Any survivors are treated to a view of tremendous arches spanning the sky,
568420	573920	glimmering in the sunlight, illuminating the night sky more brilliantly than any full Moon ever could,
573920	577420	while meteor showers of Moon dust fill the sky.
577420	581920	It's hard to say what happens next, but the tranquility may be short-lived.
581920	587920	If too much Moon dust rains down, friction heats the atmosphere, possibly boiling the oceans.
587920	594420	If not, the enormous shadows cast by the rings, combined with all the volcanic and meteoric aerosols,
594420	602420	block even more sunlight, and a period of runaway cooling could begin that freezes much of Earth's surface solid.
604420	611420	In any case, at some point, people will emerge again, from submarines or bunkers or mountaintops.
611920	618420	They will not have a great time before rebuilding civilization, and their success is not guaranteed,
618420	622920	but at least they'll be trying to do so with beautiful rings in the sky.
627920	630420	So, how do you calculate that sort of thing?
630420	633920	Well, you just need a bit of insanity and some maths.
