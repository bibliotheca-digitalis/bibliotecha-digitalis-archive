1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Oh dear, just when you thought the Iraq problem was solved because you haven't heard about it for a while,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,840
everything's back to murderous chaos and terror. What happened?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,040
In 2003, the US invaded Iraq because of its alleged connections to terrorism and weapons

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
of mass destruction. At the time, Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, ruled the country.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,120
He was part of the Sunni minority and suppressed the Shia majority.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,360
Iraq was conquered fairly quickly, but the US had no plan for the country.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,120
The until-then suppressed Shia majority took over and began oppressing the Sunnis

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,560
because suppressing other faiths has proven to be such a good idea.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,960
Unsurprisingly, a Sunni rebel uprising began and terrorist groups like al-Qaeda trickled into Iraq

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,840
and local forces, often former Sunni military, began fighting the US troops and the newly formed

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,920
Iraqi state, peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006. Since then, people in Iraq have basically

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,360
been segregated by religion. So, in a tragic irony of history, the US invasion led to the

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,640
formation of the very terrorists the US wanted to eliminate in the first place because Iraq was now

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,920
the perfect training ground for terrorism. To understand this complicated conflict better,

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,160
we need to understand the relationship between the two main branches of the Muslim faith,

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,080
Shia and Sunni Islam. Sunnis make up about 80% of the Muslim world and Shia about 20%.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,160
And the hardliners on both sides don't like each other very much.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,800
Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two most powerful players in the game of faiths.

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,280
They both have no separation of state and religion, domestic problems,

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,000
and a lot of oil money. And they support groups that fight the other religious orientation.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
And one of those terror organizations supported by Saudi Arabia was the Islamic State in Iraq,

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,080
or ISI for short. In 2010, the Arab Spring happened and changed the whole situation in

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,800
the Middle East. In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad didn't think much of resigning

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,040
and started a gruesome civil war against his own people. The longer the war went on,

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,280
the more foreign groups joined the fight, most of them for religious reasons and with the goal

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
of building an Islamic state in the region. And one of them was the infamous ISI, which now became

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,680
the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. They had fought in Iraq for years and had thousands

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
of well-trained and fanatic soldiers. They already quasi-controlled parts of Northern Iraq and were

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,120
very determined to build their religious state. And they changed the game in Syria like no one

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,880
expected. ISIS was so unbelievably violent and radical that soon it was at war with almost every

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
other faction of the Syrian rebel armies. They attacked and killed members of other Muslim

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,960
terrorist groups in the territories they controlled. They built an Islamic state with

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,400
rules so strict that even the hardliners of Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia were shocked

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,440
and withdrew their support. ISIS has been accused of responsibility for multiple massacres against

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,800
civilians, countless suicide bombings, the hostage taking of women and children, the execution of

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,600
their prisoners and beheadings. All kinds of medieval horrors we would rather not have to

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,320
illustrate. And this lovely gathering of human beings recently decided it was time to take more

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,480
territory in Iraq. Since the US left Iraq, the Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has monopolized

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
power and discriminated against Sunnis wherever possible. The government of Iraq is widely regarded

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,520
as being corrupt, incapable, and it's certainly hated by a large part of its citizens. The Iraqi

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,280
army, consisting of about 300,000 soldiers, was created using 25 billion US dollars in tax money,

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,520
but it's not loyal to its government and has been withdrawing or completely disbanding,

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,240
giving up city after city. Because ISIS has announced that everyone who opposes them will

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,680
be killed, they have proven they mean business. By June 2014, they'd conquered a big chunk of Iraq,

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,520
including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. They'd stolen hundreds of millions from captured banks,

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,840
making them the richest terror organization on earth. And they are constantly working on

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,440
establishing a super medieval religious state. Iran and the US are even considering working

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,720
together to fight them. That's how gruesome the situation is. Events in Iraq show again that

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,960
exploiting the people you've defeated in a war, denying them power, a living and a stake in the

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,120
rebuilding of the country, is just sowing the seeds of the next bout of violence.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Somehow, we have to break this circle.
