Oh dear, just when you thought the Iraq problem was solved because you haven't heard about it for a while,

00:04.320 --> 00:07.840
everything's back to murderous chaos and terror. What happened?

00:08.720 --> 00:13.040
In 2003, the US invaded Iraq because of its alleged connections to terrorism and weapons

00:13.040 --> 00:17.600
of mass destruction. At the time, Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, ruled the country.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.120
He was part of the Sunni minority and suppressed the Shia majority.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.360
Iraq was conquered fairly quickly, but the US had no plan for the country.

00:26.080 --> 00:31.120
The until-then suppressed Shia majority took over and began oppressing the Sunnis

00:31.120 --> 00:34.560
because suppressing other faiths has proven to be such a good idea.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.960
Unsurprisingly, a Sunni rebel uprising began and terrorist groups like al-Qaeda trickled into Iraq

00:40.960 --> 00:45.840
and local forces, often former Sunni military, began fighting the US troops and the newly formed

00:45.840 --> 00:51.920
Iraqi state, peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006. Since then, people in Iraq have basically

00:51.920 --> 00:57.360
been segregated by religion. So, in a tragic irony of history, the US invasion led to the

00:57.360 --> 01:02.640
formation of the very terrorists the US wanted to eliminate in the first place because Iraq was now

01:02.640 --> 01:07.920
the perfect training ground for terrorism. To understand this complicated conflict better,

01:07.920 --> 01:12.160
we need to understand the relationship between the two main branches of the Muslim faith,

01:12.160 --> 01:18.080
Shia and Sunni Islam. Sunnis make up about 80% of the Muslim world and Shia about 20%.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.160
And the hardliners on both sides don't like each other very much.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.800
Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two most powerful players in the game of faiths.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.280
They both have no separation of state and religion, domestic problems,

01:31.280 --> 01:36.000
and a lot of oil money. And they support groups that fight the other religious orientation.

01:37.040 --> 01:42.240
And one of those terror organizations supported by Saudi Arabia was the Islamic State in Iraq,

01:42.240 --> 01:48.080
or ISI for short. In 2010, the Arab Spring happened and changed the whole situation in

01:48.080 --> 01:52.800
the Middle East. In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad didn't think much of resigning

01:52.800 --> 01:57.040
and started a gruesome civil war against his own people. The longer the war went on,

01:57.040 --> 02:01.280
the more foreign groups joined the fight, most of them for religious reasons and with the goal

02:01.280 --> 02:06.640
of building an Islamic state in the region. And one of them was the infamous ISI, which now became

02:06.640 --> 02:13.680
the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. They had fought in Iraq for years and had thousands

02:13.680 --> 02:19.680
of well-trained and fanatic soldiers. They already quasi-controlled parts of Northern Iraq and were

02:19.680 --> 02:25.120
very determined to build their religious state. And they changed the game in Syria like no one

02:25.120 --> 02:30.880
expected. ISIS was so unbelievably violent and radical that soon it was at war with almost every

02:30.880 --> 02:35.440
other faction of the Syrian rebel armies. They attacked and killed members of other Muslim

02:35.440 --> 02:38.960
terrorist groups in the territories they controlled. They built an Islamic state with

02:38.960 --> 02:44.400
rules so strict that even the hardliners of Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia were shocked

02:44.400 --> 02:49.440
and withdrew their support. ISIS has been accused of responsibility for multiple massacres against

02:49.440 --> 02:54.800
civilians, countless suicide bombings, the hostage taking of women and children, the execution of

02:54.800 --> 02:59.600
their prisoners and beheadings. All kinds of medieval horrors we would rather not have to

02:59.600 --> 03:04.320
illustrate. And this lovely gathering of human beings recently decided it was time to take more

03:04.320 --> 03:10.480
territory in Iraq. Since the US left Iraq, the Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has monopolized

03:10.480 --> 03:15.680
power and discriminated against Sunnis wherever possible. The government of Iraq is widely regarded

03:15.680 --> 03:21.520
as being corrupt, incapable, and it's certainly hated by a large part of its citizens. The Iraqi

03:21.520 --> 03:27.280
army, consisting of about 300,000 soldiers, was created using 25 billion US dollars in tax money,

03:27.280 --> 03:31.520
but it's not loyal to its government and has been withdrawing or completely disbanding,

03:31.520 --> 03:36.240
giving up city after city. Because ISIS has announced that everyone who opposes them will

03:36.240 --> 03:43.680
be killed, they have proven they mean business. By June 2014, they'd conquered a big chunk of Iraq,

03:43.680 --> 03:49.520
including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. They'd stolen hundreds of millions from captured banks,

03:49.520 --> 03:53.840
making them the richest terror organization on earth. And they are constantly working on

03:53.840 --> 03:59.440
establishing a super medieval religious state. Iran and the US are even considering working

03:59.440 --> 04:04.720
together to fight them. That's how gruesome the situation is. Events in Iraq show again that

04:04.720 --> 04:08.960
exploiting the people you've defeated in a war, denying them power, a living and a stake in the

04:08.960 --> 04:13.120
rebuilding of the country, is just sowing the seeds of the next bout of violence.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.240
Somehow, we have to break this circle.
