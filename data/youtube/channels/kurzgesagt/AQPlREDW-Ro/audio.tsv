0	4320	Oh dear, just when you thought the Iraq problem was solved because you haven't heard about it for a while,
4320	7840	everything's back to murderous chaos and terror. What happened?
8720	13040	In 2003, the US invaded Iraq because of its alleged connections to terrorism and weapons
13040	17600	of mass destruction. At the time, Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, ruled the country.
17600	21120	He was part of the Sunni minority and suppressed the Shia majority.
21680	25360	Iraq was conquered fairly quickly, but the US had no plan for the country.
26080	31120	The until-then suppressed Shia majority took over and began oppressing the Sunnis
31120	34560	because suppressing other faiths has proven to be such a good idea.
35280	40960	Unsurprisingly, a Sunni rebel uprising began and terrorist groups like al-Qaeda trickled into Iraq
40960	45840	and local forces, often former Sunni military, began fighting the US troops and the newly formed
45840	51920	Iraqi state, peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006. Since then, people in Iraq have basically
51920	57360	been segregated by religion. So, in a tragic irony of history, the US invasion led to the
57360	62640	formation of the very terrorists the US wanted to eliminate in the first place because Iraq was now
62640	67920	the perfect training ground for terrorism. To understand this complicated conflict better,
67920	72160	we need to understand the relationship between the two main branches of the Muslim faith,
72160	78080	Shia and Sunni Islam. Sunnis make up about 80% of the Muslim world and Shia about 20%.
79040	82160	And the hardliners on both sides don't like each other very much.
83120	86800	Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two most powerful players in the game of faiths.
87440	91280	They both have no separation of state and religion, domestic problems,
91280	96000	and a lot of oil money. And they support groups that fight the other religious orientation.
97040	102240	And one of those terror organizations supported by Saudi Arabia was the Islamic State in Iraq,
102240	108080	or ISI for short. In 2010, the Arab Spring happened and changed the whole situation in
108080	112800	the Middle East. In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad didn't think much of resigning
112800	117040	and started a gruesome civil war against his own people. The longer the war went on,
117040	121280	the more foreign groups joined the fight, most of them for religious reasons and with the goal
121280	126640	of building an Islamic state in the region. And one of them was the infamous ISI, which now became
126640	133680	the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. They had fought in Iraq for years and had thousands
133680	139680	of well-trained and fanatic soldiers. They already quasi-controlled parts of Northern Iraq and were
139680	145120	very determined to build their religious state. And they changed the game in Syria like no one
145120	150880	expected. ISIS was so unbelievably violent and radical that soon it was at war with almost every
150880	155440	other faction of the Syrian rebel armies. They attacked and killed members of other Muslim
155440	158960	terrorist groups in the territories they controlled. They built an Islamic state with
158960	164400	rules so strict that even the hardliners of Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia were shocked
164400	169440	and withdrew their support. ISIS has been accused of responsibility for multiple massacres against
169440	174800	civilians, countless suicide bombings, the hostage taking of women and children, the execution of
174800	179600	their prisoners and beheadings. All kinds of medieval horrors we would rather not have to
179600	184320	illustrate. And this lovely gathering of human beings recently decided it was time to take more
184320	190480	territory in Iraq. Since the US left Iraq, the Shia Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has monopolized
190480	195680	power and discriminated against Sunnis wherever possible. The government of Iraq is widely regarded
195680	201520	as being corrupt, incapable, and it's certainly hated by a large part of its citizens. The Iraqi
201520	207280	army, consisting of about 300,000 soldiers, was created using 25 billion US dollars in tax money,
207280	211520	but it's not loyal to its government and has been withdrawing or completely disbanding,
211520	216240	giving up city after city. Because ISIS has announced that everyone who opposes them will
216240	223680	be killed, they have proven they mean business. By June 2014, they'd conquered a big chunk of Iraq,
223680	229520	including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. They'd stolen hundreds of millions from captured banks,
229520	233840	making them the richest terror organization on earth. And they are constantly working on
233840	239440	establishing a super medieval religious state. Iran and the US are even considering working
239440	244720	together to fight them. That's how gruesome the situation is. Events in Iraq show again that
244720	248960	exploiting the people you've defeated in a war, denying them power, a living and a stake in the
248960	253120	rebuilding of the country, is just sowing the seeds of the next bout of violence.
254000	256240	Somehow, we have to break this circle.
