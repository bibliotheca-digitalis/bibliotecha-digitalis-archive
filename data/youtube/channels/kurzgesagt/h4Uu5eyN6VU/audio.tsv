1000	8000	Being a citizen of the European Union means that many aspects of our lives are regulated by a weird entity.
9000	13000	It feels like a huge bureaucracy is making decisions over our heads.
14000	20000	Many Europeans think that their vote in the EU elections doesn't count and that the EU is not democratic.
21000	26000	How democratic is the EU really? And does your vote actually achieve anything?
27000	31000	In democratic states, public policies are based on the will of the people.
32000	34000	But the people are not a coherent thing.
35000	40000	Countless different groups are battling for influence and power to establish laws and rules that benefit them.
41000	48000	In a working democracy, there are checks and balances that are supposed to create a fair environment where these battles can be fought.
49000	52000	Term limits stop factions from dominating too much.
52000	55000	But all of this ends at our borders.
56000	60000	International politics are not democratic, but anarchic.
61000	69000	No central authority is powerful enough to ensure fairness or enforce laws, so the only law is the tyranny of the strongest and anarchy.
70000	77000	So for most of human history, powerful countries took what they wanted from others, either by extortion or by violence.
78000	85000	After World War II, the United Nations were founded to overcome this anarchy by establishing rules on how countries should behave.
86000	93000	But since the UN has virtually no power and its members often have opposing interests, it's usually politely ignored.
94000	103000	The EU is a construct that tries to have rules and laws for its member nations that are actually enforceable, as the European Court of Justice is able to make binding decisions.
104000	110000	Originally, the EU was founded to ensure peace between European nations and prosperity for the continent.
111000	114000	But it's also an attempt to gain international power for its members.
115000	120000	It's like a superstate, and it's striving to be democratic and legitimized by all of its citizens.
121000	130000	To do that, it has to solve the problem of different actors wanting different things, only that its members are countries with very different priorities.
130000	132000	So, how does this work?
133000	142000	Since the EU is ridiculously complex and politicians are even worse than scientists at naming things, we'll simplify massively and omit a lot of details.
143000	146000	You can find further reading and explanations in our sources document.
147000	153000	Okay, if you want to create a democratic union of independent nations, you have two options.
153000	159000	One, let everybody vote for national politicians who then make decisions for the union together.
160000	167000	Or, two, let every citizen vote directly for an independent institution that's able to make binding decisions.
168000	173000	Both approaches have their upsides and downsides, and the EU ended up with a mix of both of them.
174000	178000	Next to the European Court of Justice, there are four main institutions that we'll talk about today.
178000	183000	The European Council, which is made up of the heads of government or states of the member countries.
184000	187000	The Council of the EU, with ministers from the member countries.
188000	195000	The third one is the European Commission, which is the de facto government of the EU, having one commissioner for each member state.
196000	198000	And lastly, the European Parliament.
199000	205000	The Parliament is the only part of the EU that is directly elected by you, dear citizen, in the European elections.
205000	214000	In principle, all of these institutions of the EU originate from your direct or indirect vote, be it at the national or EU level.
215000	216000	But some do more than others.
217000	225000	For example, you vote for your national representative and therefore contribute to form a national government whose head of state has a seat in the European Council.
226000	232000	These leaders choose the president of the EU Commission and its fellow commissioners, who eventually are confirmed by the EU Parliament.
232000	235000	So this is a sort of indirect democracy.
236000	242000	You didn't vote for the Commission, but you voted for the people who appointed them and for those who confirmed and policed them.
243000	250000	So, in effect, 2.5 of the four main European Union institutions depend on the member state governments.
251000	257000	But since you, as a citizen, can only directly vote for the European Parliament, the question is, how powerful is it?
258000	260000	How much influence does your vote have?
260000	267000	The European Parliament started out with very little influence, but has become more and more powerful over the past two decades.
268000	272000	Today it has to approve new laws, which can be binding for the member countries.
273000	278000	It also votes on how the EU budget is spent and on international treaties.
279000	285000	All of this makes the Parliament very powerful and thus your vote very influential, even on an international level.
285000	290000	Compared to national parliaments, one major power is still missing, though.
291000	301000	The EU Parliament officially can't propose new laws on its own, which is often the core of the argument the EU is not democratic enough and that the European Parliament should be given more influence.
302000	306000	Right now, the member states' governments pretty much control the European Union.
306000	313000	Giving the Parliament more power would make the EU as a whole more democratic, but it would also take power from member states.
314000	316000	It's not clear which approach is better.
317000	322000	Ultimately, it's for the member states and us as citizens to decide how the Union should develop.
323000	326000	Okay, so can we draw a conclusion here?
327000	333000	As a whole, the EU is not as democratic as most of its member states, but it is democratic.
333000	340000	If you don't like decisions they make, regarding copyright, for example, you can look up what your representatives voted for and vote them out.
341000	346000	The struggle to make it more democratic is closely tied to who holds power over what.
347000	348000	The EU keeps changing.
349000	355000	You, dear citizen, are not only voting on the current politics, but also on what the system will look like in the future.
355000	361000	There are many partisan politicians that vowed to make the EU Parliament, and therefore your vote, stronger.
362000	364000	Many others want to keep it as it is, or even diminish it.
365000	369000	It's for you to decide what you think is better for the future of the Union.
370000	382000	Currently, it's equally important for the EU who you vote for at home, because these are the people who have the most influence in the European Union right now.
383000	384000	Opinion.
385000	389000	At home is also where the EU is often used as a scapegoat.
390000	403000	Politicians, especially before national elections, like to pretend the EU is all-powerful and makes up rules and laws over the heads of the governments and citizens, although often they were directly responsible for what the EU did.
404000	408000	Democracy is annoying and complicated and often very boring.
408000	412000	In the European Union, even more so than in the member states.
413000	422000	But voting and caring about how our political institutions change and develop is one of the most powerful things we can do as citizens.
423000	427000	The last few years have shown that extreme things can happen through elections.
428000	431000	We have to decide if we want to be an active part of this process.
432000	437000	If we don't take part in the struggle for power that is politics, others will.
438000	440000	And we might not like what they decide for us.
441000	448000	Because Europe is an important topic for us, we've translated this video into as many European languages as possible.
449000	454000	A couple of European YouTubers narrated it and uploaded it to their own channels.
454000	461000	Thank you to Funk and all YouTubers who helped us. You can find the playlist with all language versions in the description.
