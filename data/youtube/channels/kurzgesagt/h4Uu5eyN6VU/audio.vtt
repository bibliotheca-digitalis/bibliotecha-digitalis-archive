00:01.000 --> 00:08.000
Being a citizen of the European Union means that many aspects of our lives are regulated by a weird entity.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
It feels like a huge bureaucracy is making decisions over our heads.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Many Europeans think that their vote in the EU elections doesn't count and that the EU is not democratic.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
How democratic is the EU really? And does your vote actually achieve anything?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
In democratic states, public policies are based on the will of the people.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
But the people are not a coherent thing.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Countless different groups are battling for influence and power to establish laws and rules that benefit them.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
In a working democracy, there are checks and balances that are supposed to create a fair environment where these battles can be fought.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Term limits stop factions from dominating too much.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
But all of this ends at our borders.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
International politics are not democratic, but anarchic.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
No central authority is powerful enough to ensure fairness or enforce laws, so the only law is the tyranny of the strongest and anarchy.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
So for most of human history, powerful countries took what they wanted from others, either by extortion or by violence.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
After World War II, the United Nations were founded to overcome this anarchy by establishing rules on how countries should behave.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
But since the UN has virtually no power and its members often have opposing interests, it's usually politely ignored.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
The EU is a construct that tries to have rules and laws for its member nations that are actually enforceable, as the European Court of Justice is able to make binding decisions.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Originally, the EU was founded to ensure peace between European nations and prosperity for the continent.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But it's also an attempt to gain international power for its members.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
It's like a superstate, and it's striving to be democratic and legitimized by all of its citizens.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
To do that, it has to solve the problem of different actors wanting different things, only that its members are countries with very different priorities.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
So, how does this work?

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Since the EU is ridiculously complex and politicians are even worse than scientists at naming things, we'll simplify massively and omit a lot of details.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
You can find further reading and explanations in our sources document.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay, if you want to create a democratic union of independent nations, you have two options.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
One, let everybody vote for national politicians who then make decisions for the union together.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Or, two, let every citizen vote directly for an independent institution that's able to make binding decisions.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Both approaches have their upsides and downsides, and the EU ended up with a mix of both of them.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Next to the European Court of Justice, there are four main institutions that we'll talk about today.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The European Council, which is made up of the heads of government or states of the member countries.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
The Council of the EU, with ministers from the member countries.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
The third one is the European Commission, which is the de facto government of the EU, having one commissioner for each member state.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And lastly, the European Parliament.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
The Parliament is the only part of the EU that is directly elected by you, dear citizen, in the European elections.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
In principle, all of these institutions of the EU originate from your direct or indirect vote, be it at the national or EU level.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
But some do more than others.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
For example, you vote for your national representative and therefore contribute to form a national government whose head of state has a seat in the European Council.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
These leaders choose the president of the EU Commission and its fellow commissioners, who eventually are confirmed by the EU Parliament.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So this is a sort of indirect democracy.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
You didn't vote for the Commission, but you voted for the people who appointed them and for those who confirmed and policed them.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
So, in effect, 2.5 of the four main European Union institutions depend on the member state governments.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
But since you, as a citizen, can only directly vote for the European Parliament, the question is, how powerful is it?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
How much influence does your vote have?

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
The European Parliament started out with very little influence, but has become more and more powerful over the past two decades.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Today it has to approve new laws, which can be binding for the member countries.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
It also votes on how the EU budget is spent and on international treaties.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
All of this makes the Parliament very powerful and thus your vote very influential, even on an international level.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Compared to national parliaments, one major power is still missing, though.

04:51.000 --> 05:01.000
The EU Parliament officially can't propose new laws on its own, which is often the core of the argument the EU is not democratic enough and that the European Parliament should be given more influence.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Right now, the member states' governments pretty much control the European Union.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
Giving the Parliament more power would make the EU as a whole more democratic, but it would also take power from member states.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It's not clear which approach is better.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Ultimately, it's for the member states and us as citizens to decide how the Union should develop.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Okay, so can we draw a conclusion here?

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
As a whole, the EU is not as democratic as most of its member states, but it is democratic.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
If you don't like decisions they make, regarding copyright, for example, you can look up what your representatives voted for and vote them out.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
The struggle to make it more democratic is closely tied to who holds power over what.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
The EU keeps changing.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
You, dear citizen, are not only voting on the current politics, but also on what the system will look like in the future.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
There are many partisan politicians that vowed to make the EU Parliament, and therefore your vote, stronger.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Many others want to keep it as it is, or even diminish it.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
It's for you to decide what you think is better for the future of the Union.

06:10.000 --> 06:22.000
Currently, it's equally important for the EU who you vote for at home, because these are the people who have the most influence in the European Union right now.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Opinion.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
At home is also where the EU is often used as a scapegoat.

06:30.000 --> 06:43.000
Politicians, especially before national elections, like to pretend the EU is all-powerful and makes up rules and laws over the heads of the governments and citizens, although often they were directly responsible for what the EU did.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Democracy is annoying and complicated and often very boring.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
In the European Union, even more so than in the member states.

06:53.000 --> 07:02.000
But voting and caring about how our political institutions change and develop is one of the most powerful things we can do as citizens.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
The last few years have shown that extreme things can happen through elections.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
We have to decide if we want to be an active part of this process.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
If we don't take part in the struggle for power that is politics, others will.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And we might not like what they decide for us.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
Because Europe is an important topic for us, we've translated this video into as many European languages as possible.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
A couple of European YouTubers narrated it and uploaded it to their own channels.

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
Thank you to Funk and all YouTubers who helped us. You can find the playlist with all language versions in the description.
