0	3000	Is there a border we will never cross?
3000	7000	Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try?
7000	10000	It turns out, there are.
10000	17000	Even with sci-fi technology, we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it.
17000	22000	How much universe is there for us, and how far can we go?
31000	35000	If you look at the night sky, you might assume it will be there forever.
35000	39000	Stars are born and die again in a cycle that feels endless.
39000	41000	But it's not.
41000	43000	Take the Milky Way.
43000	50000	Up to 200,000 light years in diameter, containing some 100 to 400 billion stars.
50000	53000	How many stars do you think are born here each year?
53000	56000	Thousands? Millions?
56000	59000	The answer is around three.
59000	61000	Three new stars per year.
61000	67000	95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born,
67000	71000	and we live at the tail end of the age of star formation.
71000	75000	We are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it.
75000	79000	The formation of new stars will continue to slow down.
79000	81000	But there's more.
81000	85000	It turns out that the universe is rushing away from us.
85000	87000	The Milky Way is not alone.
87000	91000	Together with the Andromeda Galaxy and more than 50 dwarf galaxies,
91000	97000	it forms the Local Group, a region of space about 10 million light years in diameter.
97000	99000	Our galactic neighborhood.
99000	104000	Hundreds of galaxy groups like the Local Group make up the Laniakea Supercluster,
104000	108000	which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters.
108000	115000	In total, there are around 2 trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe.
115000	118000	Unfortunately, even if we could travel at light speed,
118000	124000	around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unreachable for us forever.
124000	127000	Let this number sink in for a moment.
127000	130000	The simple fact that there's a limit for us
130000	136000	and that there is so much universe that a human will never be able to touch is kind of frightening.
136000	140000	Why are all of these galaxies out of reach already?
140000	145000	Well, it all has to do with why there are galaxies in the first place, the Big Bang.
145000	148000	We're simplifying here, but in a nutshell,
148000	152000	about 10 to the power of minus 36 seconds after the Big Bang,
152000	155000	the young universe was a very small bubble of energy.
155000	157000	It wasn't completely uniform, though.
157000	163000	Some parts of it were a tiny, tiny bit denser than others, which had massive consequences.
163000	168000	In a process called cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded rapidly,
168000	173000	from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in a trillionth of a second.
173000	177000	That was so fast that all those tiny differences in density
177000	182000	were stretched from subatomic distances into galactic distances,
182000	187000	which is why the whole universe consists of more and less dense regions,
187000	192000	pockets of the universe filled with a bit more stuff than the space around them.
192000	198000	After that short but powerful inflation ended, gravity began trying to pull everything back together.
198000	201000	Inside the denser pockets, gravity emerged victorious,
201000	207000	and so over time, they grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today.
207000	210000	The local group is our pocket of the universe.
210000	216000	But at larger scales outside the denser pockets, the expansion of space never stopped.
216000	220000	This means that our local group is surrounded by a lot of stuff,
220000	224000	but none of those structures and galaxies are gravitationally bound to us.
224000	231000	The more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and the other gravitational pockets becomes.
231000	235000	Even worse for us, the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
235000	239000	We don't know why this happens, so we came up with the concept of dark energy.
239000	244000	You can imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up the expansion of the universe.
244000	247000	We'll explain these concepts in more detail in another video, though.
247000	252000	For now, all you need to know is that the universe is expanding faster and faster.
252000	256000	This expansion means that there's a cosmological horizon around us.
256000	261000	Everything beyond it is traveling faster relative to us than the speed of light.
261000	266000	So everything that passes the horizon is irretrievably out of reach forever,
266000	269000	and we will never be able to interact with it again.
269000	273000	In a sense, it's like a black hole's event horizon, but all around us.
274000	281000	94% of the galaxies we can see today have already passed it and are lost to us forever.
281000	286000	Wait, if we can't interact with them, how come we can still see them?
286000	290000	Well, the way we're able to see something is via light,
290000	293000	and although the speed of light is the fastest way to travel through the universe,
293000	296000	it needs time to get from one place to another.
296000	301000	Every second, light reaches us from trillions of galaxies that have passed the horizon
301000	304000	because when their light was emitted, they were much closer to us.
304000	309000	We are looking at their ancient past and see their ancient positions.
309000	315000	So the observable universe is much larger than the universe we can actually interact with.
315000	318000	In a sense, the universe is pulling off a great show for us,
318000	321000	showing us things that are out of reach forever.
321000	326000	We have no idea what these galaxies look like today, and we will never know.
326000	331000	But we will be able to observe them for a long time as their light hits our telescopes.
331000	336000	Interestingly, this means that currently the observable universe still appears to be growing
336000	342000	as more and more light released by super-distant galaxies billions of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps.
342000	350000	Still, all the pockets of the universe outside the local group will one day pass our cosmological horizon.
350000	354000	Once they do, their light won't be able to reach us anymore,
354000	359000	and from our perspective, they will fade away into darkness.
359000	364000	Every second of your life, 60,000 stars pass the horizon.
364000	371000	Since you started watching this video, around 22 million stars have moved out of our reach forever.
371000	378000	Okay, but if 94% of the observable universe is beyond the cosmic horizon and gone forever,
378000	384000	that still leaves us with 6% that is technically in reach, which is still a ton of stuff.
384000	389000	All the galaxy pockets that are less than 18 billion light years away.
389000	393000	They are still moving away, but slow enough that we could physically reach them,
393000	397000	although the chances are shrinking with every second that passes.
397000	402000	Everything that's more than around 5 million light years away is moving away from us.
402000	409000	But the closest galaxy groups are receding the slowest, so there is a time window to jump galaxy groups.
409000	413000	The challenge is extreme, though, even for Type 3 civilizations.
413000	419000	Even at the speed of light, a trip to the Mafai group, the closest pocket of galaxies outside the local group,
419000	422000	would take 11 million years.
422000	427000	If some sort of super-motivated, super-advanced civilization takes this challenge on,
427000	431000	its potential sphere of influence could expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies.
431000	436000	Although, as time passes and the universe grows, they would be separated forever.
436000	440000	It's pretty safe to assume that humans will not make this journey,
440000	444000	at least not with technologies that are even remotely on the horizon.
444000	449000	For us, the local group is most likely the largest structure that we will ever be a part of.
449000	454000	Just traveling between the stars would be an achievement of epic proportions.
454000	459000	We would already be incredibly successful if we were to colonize our cosmic backyard,
459000	468000	which accounts for 0.0000001% of the observable universe.
468000	475000	As dark energy pushes the rest of the universe away from us, the local group will become more tightly bound.
475000	480000	All its galaxies, big and small, will merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy
480000	484000	with the unoriginal name, Mildromeda, in a few billion years.
484000	491000	This process might even smash huge gas clouds together and re-spark star formation for some time.
491000	495000	And this new light will be very welcome because at some point,
495000	501000	the galaxies outside Mildromeda will be so far away that they become too faint to detect.
501000	507000	Once this happens, no information outside of the local group will reach us ever again.
507000	510000	The universe will recede from view.
510000	517000	A being born in the far future in Mildromeda will think that the universe consists of nothing but its own galaxy.
517000	523000	When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness.
523000	528000	They won't see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang.
528000	531000	They may have no way of knowing what we know today,
531000	535000	the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.
535000	539000	They might think the universe is static and eternal.
539000	545000	Mildromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.
545000	552000	Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is certainly a big enough playground to entertain humanity for a while.
552000	556000	After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system,
556000	561000	and we have dozens of billions of years at the very least to explore our galaxy.
561000	565000	And we have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time
565000	572000	to see not only our future, but also our most distant past just by looking into the night sky.
572000	576000	As isolated as the local group is, it is our home.
576000	580000	And it really is a spectacular place.
581000	584000	Time for some behind-the-scenes content.
584000	587000	You might have noticed that we sorta already made this video a few years ago,
587000	590000	but the original had a regrettable mistake.
590000	595000	In it, we said it would be physically impossible to ever leave the local group to reach other galaxy groups.
595000	599000	But our travel limit is actually much larger, as we showed in this video.
599000	605000	It's not physically impossible to go further, but just extremely unlikely that it'll ever happen.
605000	608000	So why did we leave the video up?
608000	611000	Well, it has to do with the nature of the mistake.
611000	615000	We talked to astrophysicists, and they thought it didn't matter.
616000	621000	The parts they considered important were correct, and they thought we should just leave it and move on.
621000	624000	So with that feedback, we decided to spare the video.
624000	627000	But since 2016, and really thanks to you burbs,
627000	631000	we were able to grow Kurzgesagt and add fact-checkers to the team,
631000	635000	and develop an in-depth process with experts and our detailed sources document
635000	639000	to avoid these sorts of mistakes, and also to make our work transparent.
639000	644000	We can't avoid making mistakes from time to time, but we can work hard on getting better.
644000	646000	And this video kept bugging us.
646000	652000	So we finally decided to replace it, not just re-upload, but remake it better and longer,
652000	655000	and add fun universe facts to make it worthwhile.
655000	657000	Sorry for taking so long.
657000	661000	We'll leave the old video up, but pin a comment and change the title.
661000	666000	If you want to support us and our sometimes exhausting, but hopefully worthwhile methods,
666000	670000	you can watch, share, and click the bell, and get something from our shop.
670000	676000	Inspired by this video's topic, we created a Milky Way poster and a local group poster,
676000	679000	and we're working on a series about the entire universe.
679000	686000	Visit our shop for more sciency and Kurzgesagt products designed with love and produced with care.
686000	689000	In any case, thank you for watching.
