1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Is there a border we will never cross?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It turns out, there are.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Even with sci-fi technology, we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How much universe is there for us, and how far can we go?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you look at the night sky, you might assume it will be there forever.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Stars are born and die again in a cycle that feels endless.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But it's not.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Take the Milky Way.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Up to 200,000 light years in diameter, containing some 100 to 400 billion stars.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How many stars do you think are born here each year?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thousands? Millions?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The answer is around three.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Three new stars per year.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born,

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and we live at the tail end of the age of star formation.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The formation of new stars will continue to slow down.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But there's more.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It turns out that the universe is rushing away from us.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Milky Way is not alone.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Together with the Andromeda Galaxy and more than 50 dwarf galaxies,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
it forms the Local Group, a region of space about 10 million light years in diameter.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Our galactic neighborhood.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hundreds of galaxy groups like the Local Group make up the Laniakea Supercluster,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In total, there are around 2 trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Unfortunately, even if we could travel at light speed,

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unreachable for us forever.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let this number sink in for a moment.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The simple fact that there's a limit for us

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and that there is so much universe that a human will never be able to touch is kind of frightening.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are all of these galaxies out of reach already?

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, it all has to do with why there are galaxies in the first place, the Big Bang.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're simplifying here, but in a nutshell,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
about 10 to the power of minus 36 seconds after the Big Bang,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the young universe was a very small bubble of energy.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It wasn't completely uniform, though.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Some parts of it were a tiny, tiny bit denser than others, which had massive consequences.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In a process called cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded rapidly,

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in a trillionth of a second.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That was so fast that all those tiny differences in density

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
were stretched from subatomic distances into galactic distances,

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
which is why the whole universe consists of more and less dense regions,

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
pockets of the universe filled with a bit more stuff than the space around them.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
After that short but powerful inflation ended, gravity began trying to pull everything back together.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Inside the denser pockets, gravity emerged victorious,

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and so over time, they grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The local group is our pocket of the universe.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But at larger scales outside the denser pockets, the expansion of space never stopped.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This means that our local group is surrounded by a lot of stuff,

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
but none of those structures and galaxies are gravitationally bound to us.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and the other gravitational pockets becomes.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Even worse for us, the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We don't know why this happens, so we came up with the concept of dark energy.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up the expansion of the universe.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll explain these concepts in more detail in another video, though.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For now, all you need to know is that the universe is expanding faster and faster.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This expansion means that there's a cosmological horizon around us.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Everything beyond it is traveling faster relative to us than the speed of light.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So everything that passes the horizon is irretrievably out of reach forever,

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and we will never be able to interact with it again.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In a sense, it's like a black hole's event horizon, but all around us.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
94% of the galaxies we can see today have already passed it and are lost to us forever.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wait, if we can't interact with them, how come we can still see them?

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, the way we're able to see something is via light,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and although the speed of light is the fastest way to travel through the universe,

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it needs time to get from one place to another.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Every second, light reaches us from trillions of galaxies that have passed the horizon

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
because when their light was emitted, they were much closer to us.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We are looking at their ancient past and see their ancient positions.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So the observable universe is much larger than the universe we can actually interact with.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In a sense, the universe is pulling off a great show for us,

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
showing us things that are out of reach forever.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We have no idea what these galaxies look like today, and we will never know.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But we will be able to observe them for a long time as their light hits our telescopes.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Interestingly, this means that currently the observable universe still appears to be growing

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as more and more light released by super-distant galaxies billions of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Still, all the pockets of the universe outside the local group will one day pass our cosmological horizon.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Once they do, their light won't be able to reach us anymore,

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and from our perspective, they will fade away into darkness.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Every second of your life, 60,000 stars pass the horizon.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Since you started watching this video, around 22 million stars have moved out of our reach forever.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, but if 94% of the observable universe is beyond the cosmic horizon and gone forever,

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that still leaves us with 6% that is technically in reach, which is still a ton of stuff.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
All the galaxy pockets that are less than 18 billion light years away.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They are still moving away, but slow enough that we could physically reach them,

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
although the chances are shrinking with every second that passes.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Everything that's more than around 5 million light years away is moving away from us.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But the closest galaxy groups are receding the slowest, so there is a time window to jump galaxy groups.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The challenge is extreme, though, even for Type 3 civilizations.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Even at the speed of light, a trip to the Mafai group, the closest pocket of galaxies outside the local group,

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
would take 11 million years.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If some sort of super-motivated, super-advanced civilization takes this challenge on,

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
its potential sphere of influence could expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Although, as time passes and the universe grows, they would be separated forever.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's pretty safe to assume that humans will not make this journey,

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
at least not with technologies that are even remotely on the horizon.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For us, the local group is most likely the largest structure that we will ever be a part of.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just traveling between the stars would be an achievement of epic proportions.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We would already be incredibly successful if we were to colonize our cosmic backyard,

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
which accounts for 0.0000001% of the observable universe.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
As dark energy pushes the rest of the universe away from us, the local group will become more tightly bound.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All its galaxies, big and small, will merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
with the unoriginal name, Mildromeda, in a few billion years.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This process might even smash huge gas clouds together and re-spark star formation for some time.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And this new light will be very welcome because at some point,

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the galaxies outside Mildromeda will be so far away that they become too faint to detect.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Once this happens, no information outside of the local group will reach us ever again.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The universe will recede from view.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A being born in the far future in Mildromeda will think that the universe consists of nothing but its own galaxy.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They won't see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They may have no way of knowing what we know today,

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They might think the universe is static and eternal.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mildromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is certainly a big enough playground to entertain humanity for a while.

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system,

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and we have dozens of billions of years at the very least to explore our galaxy.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And we have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to see not only our future, but also our most distant past just by looking into the night sky.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
As isolated as the local group is, it is our home.

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it really is a spectacular place.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Time for some behind-the-scenes content.

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You might have noticed that we sorta already made this video a few years ago,

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but the original had a regrettable mistake.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
In it, we said it would be physically impossible to ever leave the local group to reach other galaxy groups.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But our travel limit is actually much larger, as we showed in this video.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not physically impossible to go further, but just extremely unlikely that it'll ever happen.

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So why did we leave the video up?

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, it has to do with the nature of the mistake.

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We talked to astrophysicists, and they thought it didn't matter.

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The parts they considered important were correct, and they thought we should just leave it and move on.

135
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So with that feedback, we decided to spare the video.

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But since 2016, and really thanks to you burbs,

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
we were able to grow Kurzgesagt and add fact-checkers to the team,

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and develop an in-depth process with experts and our detailed sources document

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to avoid these sorts of mistakes, and also to make our work transparent.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We can't avoid making mistakes from time to time, but we can work hard on getting better.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And this video kept bugging us.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So we finally decided to replace it, not just re-upload, but remake it better and longer,

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and add fun universe facts to make it worthwhile.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sorry for taking so long.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We'll leave the old video up, but pin a comment and change the title.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you want to support us and our sometimes exhausting, but hopefully worthwhile methods,

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you can watch, share, and click the bell, and get something from our shop.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Inspired by this video's topic, we created a Milky Way poster and a local group poster,

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and we're working on a series about the entire universe.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Visit our shop for more sciency and Kurzgesagt products designed with love and produced with care.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In any case, thank you for watching.
