00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Is there a border we will never cross?

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try?

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
It turns out, there are.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Even with sci-fi technology, we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
How much universe is there for us, and how far can we go?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
If you look at the night sky, you might assume it will be there forever.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Stars are born and die again in a cycle that feels endless.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
But it's not.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Take the Milky Way.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
Up to 200,000 light years in diameter, containing some 100 to 400 billion stars.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
How many stars do you think are born here each year?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Thousands? Millions?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
The answer is around three.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Three new stars per year.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
and we live at the tail end of the age of star formation.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
We are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
The formation of new stars will continue to slow down.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But there's more.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
It turns out that the universe is rushing away from us.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
The Milky Way is not alone.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Together with the Andromeda Galaxy and more than 50 dwarf galaxies,

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
it forms the Local Group, a region of space about 10 million light years in diameter.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Our galactic neighborhood.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Hundreds of galaxy groups like the Local Group make up the Laniakea Supercluster,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
In total, there are around 2 trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Unfortunately, even if we could travel at light speed,

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unreachable for us forever.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Let this number sink in for a moment.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
The simple fact that there's a limit for us

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
and that there is so much universe that a human will never be able to touch is kind of frightening.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Why are all of these galaxies out of reach already?

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, it all has to do with why there are galaxies in the first place, the Big Bang.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
We're simplifying here, but in a nutshell,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
about 10 to the power of minus 36 seconds after the Big Bang,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
the young universe was a very small bubble of energy.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It wasn't completely uniform, though.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Some parts of it were a tiny, tiny bit denser than others, which had massive consequences.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
In a process called cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded rapidly,

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in a trillionth of a second.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
That was so fast that all those tiny differences in density

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
were stretched from subatomic distances into galactic distances,

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
which is why the whole universe consists of more and less dense regions,

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
pockets of the universe filled with a bit more stuff than the space around them.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
After that short but powerful inflation ended, gravity began trying to pull everything back together.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Inside the denser pockets, gravity emerged victorious,

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
and so over time, they grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
The local group is our pocket of the universe.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
But at larger scales outside the denser pockets, the expansion of space never stopped.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
This means that our local group is surrounded by a lot of stuff,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
but none of those structures and galaxies are gravitationally bound to us.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
The more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and the other gravitational pockets becomes.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Even worse for us, the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
We don't know why this happens, so we came up with the concept of dark energy.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
You can imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up the expansion of the universe.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
We'll explain these concepts in more detail in another video, though.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
For now, all you need to know is that the universe is expanding faster and faster.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
This expansion means that there's a cosmological horizon around us.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Everything beyond it is traveling faster relative to us than the speed of light.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
So everything that passes the horizon is irretrievably out of reach forever,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and we will never be able to interact with it again.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
In a sense, it's like a black hole's event horizon, but all around us.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
94% of the galaxies we can see today have already passed it and are lost to us forever.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Wait, if we can't interact with them, how come we can still see them?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, the way we're able to see something is via light,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
and although the speed of light is the fastest way to travel through the universe,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
it needs time to get from one place to another.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Every second, light reaches us from trillions of galaxies that have passed the horizon

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
because when their light was emitted, they were much closer to us.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
We are looking at their ancient past and see their ancient positions.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
So the observable universe is much larger than the universe we can actually interact with.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
In a sense, the universe is pulling off a great show for us,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
showing us things that are out of reach forever.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
We have no idea what these galaxies look like today, and we will never know.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
But we will be able to observe them for a long time as their light hits our telescopes.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Interestingly, this means that currently the observable universe still appears to be growing

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
as more and more light released by super-distant galaxies billions of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
Still, all the pockets of the universe outside the local group will one day pass our cosmological horizon.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Once they do, their light won't be able to reach us anymore,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
and from our perspective, they will fade away into darkness.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Every second of your life, 60,000 stars pass the horizon.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Since you started watching this video, around 22 million stars have moved out of our reach forever.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay, but if 94% of the observable universe is beyond the cosmic horizon and gone forever,

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
that still leaves us with 6% that is technically in reach, which is still a ton of stuff.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
All the galaxy pockets that are less than 18 billion light years away.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
They are still moving away, but slow enough that we could physically reach them,

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
although the chances are shrinking with every second that passes.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
Everything that's more than around 5 million light years away is moving away from us.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
But the closest galaxy groups are receding the slowest, so there is a time window to jump galaxy groups.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
The challenge is extreme, though, even for Type 3 civilizations.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
Even at the speed of light, a trip to the Mafai group, the closest pocket of galaxies outside the local group,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
would take 11 million years.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
If some sort of super-motivated, super-advanced civilization takes this challenge on,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
its potential sphere of influence could expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Although, as time passes and the universe grows, they would be separated forever.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
It's pretty safe to assume that humans will not make this journey,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
at least not with technologies that are even remotely on the horizon.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
For us, the local group is most likely the largest structure that we will ever be a part of.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Just traveling between the stars would be an achievement of epic proportions.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
We would already be incredibly successful if we were to colonize our cosmic backyard,

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
which accounts for 0.0000001% of the observable universe.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
As dark energy pushes the rest of the universe away from us, the local group will become more tightly bound.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
All its galaxies, big and small, will merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
with the unoriginal name, Mildromeda, in a few billion years.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
This process might even smash huge gas clouds together and re-spark star formation for some time.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And this new light will be very welcome because at some point,

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
the galaxies outside Mildromeda will be so far away that they become too faint to detect.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Once this happens, no information outside of the local group will reach us ever again.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
The universe will recede from view.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
A being born in the far future in Mildromeda will think that the universe consists of nothing but its own galaxy.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
They won't see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
They may have no way of knowing what we know today,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
the nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
They might think the universe is static and eternal.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
Mildromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
Still, with its trillion stars, the local group is certainly a big enough playground to entertain humanity for a while.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
and we have dozens of billions of years at the very least to explore our galaxy.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
And we have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
to see not only our future, but also our most distant past just by looking into the night sky.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
As isolated as the local group is, it is our home.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And it really is a spectacular place.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Time for some behind-the-scenes content.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
You might have noticed that we sorta already made this video a few years ago,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
but the original had a regrettable mistake.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
In it, we said it would be physically impossible to ever leave the local group to reach other galaxy groups.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
But our travel limit is actually much larger, as we showed in this video.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
It's not physically impossible to go further, but just extremely unlikely that it'll ever happen.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So why did we leave the video up?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, it has to do with the nature of the mistake.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
We talked to astrophysicists, and they thought it didn't matter.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
The parts they considered important were correct, and they thought we should just leave it and move on.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
So with that feedback, we decided to spare the video.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
But since 2016, and really thanks to you burbs,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
we were able to grow Kurzgesagt and add fact-checkers to the team,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
and develop an in-depth process with experts and our detailed sources document

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
to avoid these sorts of mistakes, and also to make our work transparent.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
We can't avoid making mistakes from time to time, but we can work hard on getting better.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And this video kept bugging us.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
So we finally decided to replace it, not just re-upload, but remake it better and longer,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
and add fun universe facts to make it worthwhile.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Sorry for taking so long.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
We'll leave the old video up, but pin a comment and change the title.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
If you want to support us and our sometimes exhausting, but hopefully worthwhile methods,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
you can watch, share, and click the bell, and get something from our shop.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
Inspired by this video's topic, we created a Milky Way poster and a local group poster,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
and we're working on a series about the entire universe.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
Visit our shop for more sciency and Kurzgesagt products designed with love and produced with care.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
In any case, thank you for watching.
