1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
It's hard to get to space.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,940
As much as we all wish there were an easy and affordable way to see our planet floating

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,980
in the dark, right now, the only way is to become an astronaut or a billionaire.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,860
But there is a concept that might make it possible while serving as the starting point

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,740
for the exploration of the universe, the space elevator.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:32,820
How exactly does it work?

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,740
To understand how a space elevator will get us into space, we must first understand what

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,620
an orbit is.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,460
Being in orbit basically means falling towards something, but moving fast enough to miss.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,440
If you throw a ball on Earth, it makes an arc through the air and then hits the ground.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,640
In space, gravity makes you move much the same way, but if you move sideways fast enough,

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,780
the curvature of the Earth makes the ground fall away beneath you as fast as gravity pulls

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,820
you towards it.

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,020
So to enter Earth's orbit, rockets have to go up and sideways fast.

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,620
By contrast, a space elevator taps into energy from the Earth's rotation to get the cargo

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,640
going fast.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
Imagine a child spinning a toy on a rope with an ant on the child's hand.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,040
As the ant climbs out along the rope, it starts to move faster and faster as it ascends.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,300
Compared to rockets, with cargo launched on an elevator, you only need to provide the

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,160
energy to go up.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,700
Fast sideways movement comes free with the Earth's rotation.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,500
But a space elevator would, without a doubt, be the single largest and most expensive structure

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,360
ever built by humans.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,800
So is it worth it?

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,320
It all comes down to costs.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's burn a huge amount of rocket fuel just to get a small amount of cargo into space.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,720
At current prices, it costs about $20,000 to put one kilogram of payload into space.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,320
That's $1.3 million for the average human, $40 million for your car, billions for an

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,680
international space station.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,960
This immense cost is one of the major limitations of human spaceflight.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,900
Even with advancing technology, this cost isn't likely to be comparable with the price

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,360
of an airline ticket anytime soon.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,360
A space elevator would solve this problem.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,880
After construction, a space elevator is projected to reduce the cost 100-fold to $200 per kilogram.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,480
If an inexpensive space elevator costs $20 billion, then we'll recoup our losses after

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
launching only 1,000 tons.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Close to the weight of two international space stations.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,880
So what would a space elevator look like in real life?

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,860
A space elevator has four major components.

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,620
The tether, anchor, counterweight, and climber.

41
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,520
The elevator part of the space elevator is the tether and the climber.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,280
It extends from the surface of the Earth to space.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
The climber is like a conventional elevator carriage, a chamber that works its way up

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,080
and down the tether.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,520
At the base would be an anchor, pinning the tether to the Earth, along with a port for

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
climbers.

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,760
At the top is the counterweight, which holds up the tether.

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
The tether is held tight like a rope, and supported from above by the tension from the

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,080
counterweight, located higher than 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,160
At the counterweight could be a space station, a launching point for all missions from the

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,240
spaceport elevator.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,400
But can we actually build one?

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
It's hard to say.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
The biggest challenge is the tether.

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,560
It needs to be light, affordable, and more stable than any material we can produce right

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
now.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,040
There are promising materials like graphene and diamond nanothreads, but even they may

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,960
not be strong enough.

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,320
And aside from being incredibly strong, the tether would also have to withstand atmospheric

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,880
corrosion, radiation, and micrometeorite and debris impacts.

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,780
Additionally, it takes several days to climb the elevator.

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,820
How do we power the climber?

63
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,280
It requires a lot of energy to go up.

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,920
Do we need a nuclear reactor on our elevator carriage?

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,400
Or do we beam it power from the ground with a superpowered laser?

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,740
And where do we get the raw materials for a 36,000 kilometer long tether?

67
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,160
Do we make it on Earth and launch it into space?

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,480
Or do we make it in space and lower it down to the Earth?

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,840
Could asteroid mining be the answer?

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,160
Put simply, there are still some major technological hurdles to overcome.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,680
And a space elevator is not without risk.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,240
Should the tether break, it would collapse in spectacular style.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,280
If it breaks near the anchor, the force exerted by the counterweight will cause the entire

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,360
elevator to rise up, ascending into space.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,840
Should it break near the counterweight, the tether will fall, wrapping around the world

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,600
and whipping the end off.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,340
The resulting debris in orbit could pose serious problems to future spaceflight.

78
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,880
If we build a space elevator on Earth, we have to do it right the first time.

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,800
For these reasons, some experts have proposed first building a space elevator on the Moon.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,200
The Moon's gravity is much weaker than the Earth's, so a flimsier but existent material

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,160
like Kevlar could serve as a tether.

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Even with all these challenges, the payoff of having a working space elevator would be immense.

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,800
It might be the first step to truly becoming a space-faring civilization.

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,440
Maybe we will never build a space elevator, but in trying to do so, we might learn an

85
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,000
awful lot.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,040
And when it comes to the exploration of the universe, there can't be too many dreams of

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
a glorious future.
