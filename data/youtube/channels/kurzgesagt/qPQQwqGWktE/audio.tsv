0	3860	It's hard to get to space.
3860	7940	As much as we all wish there were an easy and affordable way to see our planet floating
7940	13980	in the dark, right now, the only way is to become an astronaut or a billionaire.
13980	17860	But there is a concept that might make it possible while serving as the starting point
17860	21740	for the exploration of the universe, the space elevator.
21740	32820	How exactly does it work?
32820	37740	To understand how a space elevator will get us into space, we must first understand what
37740	39620	an orbit is.
39620	45460	Being in orbit basically means falling towards something, but moving fast enough to miss.
45460	50440	If you throw a ball on Earth, it makes an arc through the air and then hits the ground.
50440	55640	In space, gravity makes you move much the same way, but if you move sideways fast enough,
55640	59780	the curvature of the Earth makes the ground fall away beneath you as fast as gravity pulls
59780	61820	you towards it.
61820	68020	So to enter Earth's orbit, rockets have to go up and sideways fast.
68020	72620	By contrast, a space elevator taps into energy from the Earth's rotation to get the cargo
72620	74640	going fast.
74640	79200	Imagine a child spinning a toy on a rope with an ant on the child's hand.
79200	85040	As the ant climbs out along the rope, it starts to move faster and faster as it ascends.
85040	89300	Compared to rockets, with cargo launched on an elevator, you only need to provide the
89300	91160	energy to go up.
91160	94700	Fast sideways movement comes free with the Earth's rotation.
94700	99500	But a space elevator would, without a doubt, be the single largest and most expensive structure
99500	101360	ever built by humans.
101360	103800	So is it worth it?
103800	106320	It all comes down to costs.
106360	111000	Let's burn a huge amount of rocket fuel just to get a small amount of cargo into space.
111000	116720	At current prices, it costs about $20,000 to put one kilogram of payload into space.
116720	122320	That's $1.3 million for the average human, $40 million for your car, billions for an
122320	124680	international space station.
124680	128960	This immense cost is one of the major limitations of human spaceflight.
128960	132900	Even with advancing technology, this cost isn't likely to be comparable with the price
132900	135360	of an airline ticket anytime soon.
135400	138360	A space elevator would solve this problem.
138360	144880	After construction, a space elevator is projected to reduce the cost 100-fold to $200 per kilogram.
144880	150480	If an inexpensive space elevator costs $20 billion, then we'll recoup our losses after
150480	153280	launching only 1,000 tons.
153280	156440	Close to the weight of two international space stations.
156440	159880	So what would a space elevator look like in real life?
159920	162860	A space elevator has four major components.
162860	166620	The tether, anchor, counterweight, and climber.
166620	170520	The elevator part of the space elevator is the tether and the climber.
170520	173280	It extends from the surface of the Earth to space.
173280	177440	The climber is like a conventional elevator carriage, a chamber that works its way up
177440	179080	and down the tether.
179080	183520	At the base would be an anchor, pinning the tether to the Earth, along with a port for
183520	184520	climbers.
184520	187760	At the top is the counterweight, which holds up the tether.
187760	191680	The tether is held tight like a rope, and supported from above by the tension from the
191680	197080	counterweight, located higher than 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.
197080	201160	At the counterweight could be a space station, a launching point for all missions from the
201160	203240	spaceport elevator.
203240	205400	But can we actually build one?
205400	206840	It's hard to say.
206840	208760	The biggest challenge is the tether.
208760	213560	It needs to be light, affordable, and more stable than any material we can produce right
213560	214840	now.
214840	219040	There are promising materials like graphene and diamond nanothreads, but even they may
219040	220960	not be strong enough.
220960	225320	And aside from being incredibly strong, the tether would also have to withstand atmospheric
225320	229880	corrosion, radiation, and micrometeorite and debris impacts.
229880	233780	Additionally, it takes several days to climb the elevator.
233780	235820	How do we power the climber?
235820	238280	It requires a lot of energy to go up.
238280	241920	Do we need a nuclear reactor on our elevator carriage?
241920	245400	Or do we beam it power from the ground with a superpowered laser?
245400	249740	And where do we get the raw materials for a 36,000 kilometer long tether?
249740	252160	Do we make it on Earth and launch it into space?
252160	255480	Or do we make it in space and lower it down to the Earth?
255480	257840	Could asteroid mining be the answer?
257840	263160	Put simply, there are still some major technological hurdles to overcome.
263160	265680	And a space elevator is not without risk.
265680	269240	Should the tether break, it would collapse in spectacular style.
269240	273280	If it breaks near the anchor, the force exerted by the counterweight will cause the entire
273280	276360	elevator to rise up, ascending into space.
276360	279840	Should it break near the counterweight, the tether will fall, wrapping around the world
279840	281600	and whipping the end off.
281600	286340	The resulting debris in orbit could pose serious problems to future spaceflight.
286340	290880	If we build a space elevator on Earth, we have to do it right the first time.
290880	295800	For these reasons, some experts have proposed first building a space elevator on the Moon.
295800	300200	The Moon's gravity is much weaker than the Earth's, so a flimsier but existent material
300200	303160	like Kevlar could serve as a tether.
303160	308040	Even with all these challenges, the payoff of having a working space elevator would be immense.
308040	312800	It might be the first step to truly becoming a space-faring civilization.
312800	317440	Maybe we will never build a space elevator, but in trying to do so, we might learn an
317440	319000	awful lot.
319000	323040	And when it comes to the exploration of the universe, there can't be too many dreams of
323040	324040	a glorious future.
