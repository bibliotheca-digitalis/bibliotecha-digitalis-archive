00:00.000 --> 00:03.860
It's hard to get to space.

00:03.860 --> 00:07.940
As much as we all wish there were an easy and affordable way to see our planet floating

00:07.940 --> 00:13.980
in the dark, right now, the only way is to become an astronaut or a billionaire.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.860
But there is a concept that might make it possible while serving as the starting point

00:17.860 --> 00:21.740
for the exploration of the universe, the space elevator.

00:21.740 --> 00:32.820
How exactly does it work?

00:32.820 --> 00:37.740
To understand how a space elevator will get us into space, we must first understand what

00:37.740 --> 00:39.620
an orbit is.

00:39.620 --> 00:45.460
Being in orbit basically means falling towards something, but moving fast enough to miss.

00:45.460 --> 00:50.440
If you throw a ball on Earth, it makes an arc through the air and then hits the ground.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.640
In space, gravity makes you move much the same way, but if you move sideways fast enough,

00:55.640 --> 00:59.780
the curvature of the Earth makes the ground fall away beneath you as fast as gravity pulls

00:59.780 --> 01:01.820
you towards it.

01:01.820 --> 01:08.020
So to enter Earth's orbit, rockets have to go up and sideways fast.

01:08.020 --> 01:12.620
By contrast, a space elevator taps into energy from the Earth's rotation to get the cargo

01:12.620 --> 01:14.640
going fast.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.200
Imagine a child spinning a toy on a rope with an ant on the child's hand.

01:19.200 --> 01:25.040
As the ant climbs out along the rope, it starts to move faster and faster as it ascends.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.300
Compared to rockets, with cargo launched on an elevator, you only need to provide the

01:29.300 --> 01:31.160
energy to go up.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.700
Fast sideways movement comes free with the Earth's rotation.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.500
But a space elevator would, without a doubt, be the single largest and most expensive structure

01:39.500 --> 01:41.360
ever built by humans.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.800
So is it worth it?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.320
It all comes down to costs.

01:46.360 --> 01:51.000
Let's burn a huge amount of rocket fuel just to get a small amount of cargo into space.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.720
At current prices, it costs about $20,000 to put one kilogram of payload into space.

01:56.720 --> 02:02.320
That's $1.3 million for the average human, $40 million for your car, billions for an

02:02.320 --> 02:04.680
international space station.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.960
This immense cost is one of the major limitations of human spaceflight.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.900
Even with advancing technology, this cost isn't likely to be comparable with the price

02:12.900 --> 02:15.360
of an airline ticket anytime soon.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.360
A space elevator would solve this problem.

02:18.360 --> 02:24.880
After construction, a space elevator is projected to reduce the cost 100-fold to $200 per kilogram.

02:24.880 --> 02:30.480
If an inexpensive space elevator costs $20 billion, then we'll recoup our losses after

02:30.480 --> 02:33.280
launching only 1,000 tons.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.440
Close to the weight of two international space stations.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.880
So what would a space elevator look like in real life?

02:39.920 --> 02:42.860
A space elevator has four major components.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.620
The tether, anchor, counterweight, and climber.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.520
The elevator part of the space elevator is the tether and the climber.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.280
It extends from the surface of the Earth to space.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.440
The climber is like a conventional elevator carriage, a chamber that works its way up

02:57.440 --> 02:59.080
and down the tether.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.520
At the base would be an anchor, pinning the tether to the Earth, along with a port for

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
climbers.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.760
At the top is the counterweight, which holds up the tether.

03:07.760 --> 03:11.680
The tether is held tight like a rope, and supported from above by the tension from the

03:11.680 --> 03:17.080
counterweight, located higher than 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.160
At the counterweight could be a space station, a launching point for all missions from the

03:21.160 --> 03:23.240
spaceport elevator.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.400
But can we actually build one?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.840
It's hard to say.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.760
The biggest challenge is the tether.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.560
It needs to be light, affordable, and more stable than any material we can produce right

03:33.560 --> 03:34.840
now.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.040
There are promising materials like graphene and diamond nanothreads, but even they may

03:39.040 --> 03:40.960
not be strong enough.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.320
And aside from being incredibly strong, the tether would also have to withstand atmospheric

03:45.320 --> 03:49.880
corrosion, radiation, and micrometeorite and debris impacts.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.780
Additionally, it takes several days to climb the elevator.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.820
How do we power the climber?

03:55.820 --> 03:58.280
It requires a lot of energy to go up.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.920
Do we need a nuclear reactor on our elevator carriage?

04:01.920 --> 04:05.400
Or do we beam it power from the ground with a superpowered laser?

04:05.400 --> 04:09.740
And where do we get the raw materials for a 36,000 kilometer long tether?

04:09.740 --> 04:12.160
Do we make it on Earth and launch it into space?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.480
Or do we make it in space and lower it down to the Earth?

04:15.480 --> 04:17.840
Could asteroid mining be the answer?

04:17.840 --> 04:23.160
Put simply, there are still some major technological hurdles to overcome.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.680
And a space elevator is not without risk.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.240
Should the tether break, it would collapse in spectacular style.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.280
If it breaks near the anchor, the force exerted by the counterweight will cause the entire

04:33.280 --> 04:36.360
elevator to rise up, ascending into space.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.840
Should it break near the counterweight, the tether will fall, wrapping around the world

04:39.840 --> 04:41.600
and whipping the end off.

04:41.600 --> 04:46.340
The resulting debris in orbit could pose serious problems to future spaceflight.

04:46.340 --> 04:50.880
If we build a space elevator on Earth, we have to do it right the first time.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.800
For these reasons, some experts have proposed first building a space elevator on the Moon.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.200
The Moon's gravity is much weaker than the Earth's, so a flimsier but existent material

05:00.200 --> 05:03.160
like Kevlar could serve as a tether.

05:03.160 --> 05:08.040
Even with all these challenges, the payoff of having a working space elevator would be immense.

05:08.040 --> 05:12.800
It might be the first step to truly becoming a space-faring civilization.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.440
Maybe we will never build a space elevator, but in trying to do so, we might learn an

05:17.440 --> 05:19.000
awful lot.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.040
And when it comes to the exploration of the universe, there can't be too many dreams of

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
a glorious future.
