1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
A war has been going on for billions of years that breeds well-armed monsters who struggle

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,260
with other monsters for survival.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,400
Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
systems deal with their weapons easily.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
But there are exceptions.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,340
Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba that has not only developed a deadly taste for human brains,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,820
but is also a match for our defenses and stars in dramatic headlines.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:43,260
What happens when this monster enters your body?

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,000
Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a nucleus, one of the smallest life forms

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,580
on Earth.

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,860
It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other critters that it devours whole and rips into

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,460
pieces.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,900
Like many amoebae, it is able to transform into different stages that help it survive.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,460
But most of the time, Nagleria fowleri is in its trophozoite stage, during which it

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,740
looks like a squishy blob with tiny arms, and hunts, divides, and thrives.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,880
Its natural home is in freshwater, ponds, rivers, lakes, and hot springs.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,580
But unfortunately, it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools, fountains, or spas

18
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,820
when they are not properly treated.

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,580
The warmer the water, the more it thrives and multiplies.

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,300
So in the summer, when humans seek to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances are

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,220
highest that both species will interact.

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,140
Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of people regularly have contact with the

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,020
amoeba, especially in warmer climates, and many people even seem to have antibodies against

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
it.

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,360
And this is mostly okay, you can even swallow it without consequences.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,040
Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water contaminated with the amoeba, and

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,980
water splashes high up into their noses.

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,180
In a single drop of lake water, there are millions of viruses, bacteria, and amoebae,

29
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,500
and that isn't really a big deal.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,600
But Nagleria fowleri is different.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,180
Let's zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim enjoying a great summer day, and see

32
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,240
what happens.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,800
First of all, the amoeba doesn't really want to be inside your nose, as it's not really

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
looking for trouble, it just wants to eat a few bacteria.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,960
Instead, it's greeted by your natural defenses.

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,500
Unfortunately for humans, Nagleria fowleri happens to be exceptionally good at generally

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,900
flying under the radar of your immune system.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,580
For example, the inside of your nose is covered by mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,860
kill or stun possible invaders, or alert immune cells.

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,040
But Nagleria fowleri is not particularly bothered by them, and instead calmly checks out the

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
scenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal.

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,320
Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny critter stumbles over something that actually sparks

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,060
its interest.

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,800
Nerve cells.

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,160
Your nose is filled with a large network of olfactory nerve cells that pick up molecules

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,320
from the outside and transmit their information to your olfactory bulb, the center of smell

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,840
in your brain.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,320
To do their job, these cells talk to each other by releasing various messenger chemicals

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
and recognizing them via specific receptors.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,360
One of the most important of these chemicals is acetylcholine.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,560
Through sheer evolutionary bad luck, Nagleria fowleri happens to have receptors that recognize

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,560
acetylcholine, and it seems to attract them irresistibly, a little like moths that are

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
attracted by light.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,440
So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job, using plenty of acetylcholine to talk

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,040
to the brain, Nagleria fowleri enters your tissue.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,280
It seems to follow the chemical signals upstream.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors, begin to attack the amoebae.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,720
Individually they have no chance against them, as the invaders are large and pretty buff

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,100
fighters used to dealing with tough enemies.

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,520
So the defenders swarm the intruders and kill them either by vomiting chemicals that punch

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,540
holes into them, or by literally ripping parts of them off and devouring them.

62
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,880
But the Nagleria fowleri train is still on track, and while the neutrophil attacks slow

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,220
them down, they continue to follow the olfactory nerves to their final destination, your brain.

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,340
This process can take between one and nine days, and you'll probably not notice anything

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,740
during that time, until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the center of smell and

66
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,900
entrance to your brain.

67
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Your brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims, and they all release that wonderful

68
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
acetylcholine.

69
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,740
Nagleria fowleri initiates a massacre and releases an onslaught of various attack molecules.

70
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,700
Some of them are basically little bombs that rip holes into your cells on contact so their

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,240
pieces can be eagerly consumed.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,680
But Nagleria fowleri is now multiplying, and it's also becoming really creepy.

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,860
In a feeding frenzy, it can develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups that look

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,480
like giant, eerie mouths.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,800
The amoebae engage your brain cells, suck them in, and rip large bites out of them while

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,580
they're still alive.

77
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,600
Now things escalate quickly, and the disease that will kill you sets in.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Alerted by the massacre, millions of immune cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and microglias

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,160
invade the infected tissue.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
Which is a problem.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,880
Your immune system is dangerous, and not exactly a careful fighter.

82
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,560
It's like burning down a forest to kill the wolves inside it.

83
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,700
A really bad idea in the brain.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,280
They waste no time and attack the amoeba, using all the weapons available to them, from

85
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,600
chemicals to trying to eat them alive.

86
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,920
Neutrophils explode themselves to erect barriers spiked with deadly chemicals.

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
A fierce battle ensues.

88
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,080
Nagleria fowleri can actually fight back, itself attacking and killing many immune cells.

89
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,820
The immune system now throws everything it has at the invader, but in vain.

90
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,800
The complement system, tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on their own, are

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
easily disabled.

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Antibodies, usually one of your super weapons, are just destroyed or swallowed.

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,520
A high fever that usually slows enemies down does nothing, as the amoeba actually thrives

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
in the heat.

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,440
All the while, the amoeba continue to multiply, fight, and devour your brain cells.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,040
A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,720
One major thing your immune cells do when they fight is to cause inflammation, which

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,460
directs large amounts of fluid from your bloodstream into the site of an infection.

99
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,900
So as the battle rages on without a clear winner, more and more fluid enters the brain.

100
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,880
At this point, the human will feel symptoms that quickly escalate.

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,220
It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,100
As the battle spreads rapidly through the brain, serious symptoms appear, from confusion,

103
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,100
inability to concentrate, to fatigue, seizures, and hallucinations.

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,220
The brain swells up massively, but can't expand due to the bones surrounding it.

105
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,840
So it compresses and disables the brainstem that controls things like breathing.

106
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,060
Usually within a week, the patient dies.

107
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,020
Up to 97% of the patients infected by the amoeba share this fate.

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,040
In almost all cases, by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is recognized, the disastrous

109
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,240
battle for the brain is already so far along that there is almost nothing to be done.

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,220
Not only do we currently not have effective treatments, there are also an abundance of

111
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,800
open questions about how an amoeba that usually enjoys its life in open water is able to overcome

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,120
our immune system so effectively.

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,620
So how worried do you need to be about this horrifying killer amoeba?

114
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,920
Well, not very.

115
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,860
While the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly, and the infection truly horrible,

116
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,640
there have only been a few hundred cases in the last few decades.

117
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,920
You are way more likely to drown in a pool than to get infected.

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,800
Not only does the amoeba need to be flushed high up your nose, it also needs to get a

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,400
good grip, and it also has to make its way through the first lines of your defenses.

120
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Ultimately, Naegleria fowleri is neither evil nor a huge public health risk.

121
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,120
But every year, some unlucky people have to deal with it.

122
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,720
We still have so much to learn about it, and until we find a way to treat it, Naegleria

123
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,160
fowleri will continue to be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting in puddles and lakes,

124
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,600
and sometimes pools.

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
Usually for bacteria.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,600
And very occasionally, for people.

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Oh, hey.

128
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Who are you?

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
It's me.

130
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Your existential dread.

131
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh, okay.

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm here to make you question your own existence and everything you hold dear in life.

133
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,920
Could you not, please?

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Too late.

135
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,080
Just look at all these amazing posters full of humbling visualizations, like the scale

136
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
of the universe.

137
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,280
Look how huge it is and how small you are.

138
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,720
Look at the Education Edition, how it dives deep into the history of evolution or all

139
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,880
the other scientific fields to make you feel bad for all the stuff you don't know.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,000
Or look at this one, it glows in the dark.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,080
But dread, these do make me feel good, actually.

142
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,920
They do fill me with excitement and awe about how amazing our universe is.

143
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,520
And I love learning, and look how pretty they are.

144
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
No!

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
I can't persist in the presence of war!

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,320
If you too want to overcome your existential dread, make your life beautiful and also support

147
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Kurzgesagt so we can put thousands of hours into our videos and release them for free,

148
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,280
you can get these and many, many more amazing posters or shirts or so many more things in

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
our shop.

150
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,240
We put as much care into our products as into our videos, trying to find something clever

151
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,760
or a new angle that will challenge your perspective while still teaching you the core aspects.

152
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,320
It's the best way to support what we do on this channel.
