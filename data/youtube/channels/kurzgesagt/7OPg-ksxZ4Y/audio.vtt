00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
A war has been going on for billions of years that breeds well-armed monsters who struggle

00:06.520 --> 00:09.260
with other monsters for survival.

00:09.260 --> 00:14.400
Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune

00:14.400 --> 00:17.520
systems deal with their weapons easily.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.920
But there are exceptions.

00:19.920 --> 00:26.340
Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba that has not only developed a deadly taste for human brains,

00:26.340 --> 00:31.820
but is also a match for our defenses and stars in dramatic headlines.

00:31.820 --> 00:43.260
What happens when this monster enters your body?

00:43.260 --> 00:49.000
Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a nucleus, one of the smallest life forms

00:49.000 --> 00:50.580
on Earth.

00:50.580 --> 00:55.860
It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other critters that it devours whole and rips into

00:55.860 --> 00:57.460
pieces.

00:57.460 --> 01:02.900
Like many amoebae, it is able to transform into different stages that help it survive.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.460
But most of the time, Nagleria fowleri is in its trophozoite stage, during which it

01:07.460 --> 01:13.740
looks like a squishy blob with tiny arms, and hunts, divides, and thrives.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.880
Its natural home is in freshwater, ponds, rivers, lakes, and hot springs.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.580
But unfortunately, it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools, fountains, or spas

01:24.580 --> 01:26.820
when they are not properly treated.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.580
The warmer the water, the more it thrives and multiplies.

01:30.580 --> 01:35.300
So in the summer, when humans seek to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances are

01:35.300 --> 01:39.220
highest that both species will interact.

01:39.220 --> 01:43.140
Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of people regularly have contact with the

01:43.140 --> 01:48.020
amoeba, especially in warmer climates, and many people even seem to have antibodies against

01:48.020 --> 01:49.020
it.

01:49.020 --> 01:53.360
And this is mostly okay, you can even swallow it without consequences.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.040
Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water contaminated with the amoeba, and

01:58.040 --> 02:00.980
water splashes high up into their noses.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.180
In a single drop of lake water, there are millions of viruses, bacteria, and amoebae,

02:06.180 --> 02:08.500
and that isn't really a big deal.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.600
But Nagleria fowleri is different.

02:11.600 --> 02:16.180
Let's zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim enjoying a great summer day, and see

02:16.180 --> 02:19.240
what happens.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.800
First of all, the amoeba doesn't really want to be inside your nose, as it's not really

02:22.800 --> 02:26.080
looking for trouble, it just wants to eat a few bacteria.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.960
Instead, it's greeted by your natural defenses.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.500
Unfortunately for humans, Nagleria fowleri happens to be exceptionally good at generally

02:34.500 --> 02:37.900
flying under the radar of your immune system.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.580
For example, the inside of your nose is covered by mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that

02:42.580 --> 02:46.860
kill or stun possible invaders, or alert immune cells.

02:46.860 --> 02:52.040
But Nagleria fowleri is not particularly bothered by them, and instead calmly checks out the

02:52.080 --> 02:55.440
scenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal.

02:55.440 --> 03:01.320
Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny critter stumbles over something that actually sparks

03:01.320 --> 03:03.060
its interest.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.800
Nerve cells.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.160
Your nose is filled with a large network of olfactory nerve cells that pick up molecules

03:09.160 --> 03:14.320
from the outside and transmit their information to your olfactory bulb, the center of smell

03:14.320 --> 03:15.840
in your brain.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.320
To do their job, these cells talk to each other by releasing various messenger chemicals

03:20.640 --> 03:24.000
and recognizing them via specific receptors.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.360
One of the most important of these chemicals is acetylcholine.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.560
Through sheer evolutionary bad luck, Nagleria fowleri happens to have receptors that recognize

03:34.560 --> 03:39.560
acetylcholine, and it seems to attract them irresistibly, a little like moths that are

03:39.560 --> 03:41.840
attracted by light.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.440
So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job, using plenty of acetylcholine to talk

03:46.440 --> 03:50.040
to the brain, Nagleria fowleri enters your tissue.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.280
It seems to follow the chemical signals upstream.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.960
Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors, begin to attack the amoebae.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.720
Individually they have no chance against them, as the invaders are large and pretty buff

04:02.720 --> 04:06.100
fighters used to dealing with tough enemies.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.520
So the defenders swarm the intruders and kill them either by vomiting chemicals that punch

04:10.520 --> 04:15.540
holes into them, or by literally ripping parts of them off and devouring them.

04:15.620 --> 04:19.880
But the Nagleria fowleri train is still on track, and while the neutrophil attacks slow

04:19.880 --> 04:27.220
them down, they continue to follow the olfactory nerves to their final destination, your brain.

04:27.220 --> 04:31.340
This process can take between one and nine days, and you'll probably not notice anything

04:31.340 --> 04:36.740
during that time, until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the center of smell and

04:36.740 --> 04:38.900
entrance to your brain.

04:38.900 --> 04:43.900
Your brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims, and they all release that wonderful

04:43.900 --> 04:46.300
acetylcholine.

04:46.300 --> 04:52.740
Nagleria fowleri initiates a massacre and releases an onslaught of various attack molecules.

04:52.740 --> 04:56.700
Some of them are basically little bombs that rip holes into your cells on contact so their

04:56.700 --> 04:59.240
pieces can be eagerly consumed.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.680
But Nagleria fowleri is now multiplying, and it's also becoming really creepy.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.860
In a feeding frenzy, it can develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups that look

05:08.860 --> 05:11.480
like giant, eerie mouths.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.800
The amoebae engage your brain cells, suck them in, and rip large bites out of them while

05:16.800 --> 05:18.580
they're still alive.

05:18.580 --> 05:23.600
Now things escalate quickly, and the disease that will kill you sets in.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.800
Alerted by the massacre, millions of immune cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and microglias

05:29.800 --> 05:32.160
invade the infected tissue.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.280
Which is a problem.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.880
Your immune system is dangerous, and not exactly a careful fighter.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.560
It's like burning down a forest to kill the wolves inside it.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.700
A really bad idea in the brain.

05:44.700 --> 05:49.280
They waste no time and attack the amoeba, using all the weapons available to them, from

05:49.280 --> 05:52.600
chemicals to trying to eat them alive.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.920
Neutrophils explode themselves to erect barriers spiked with deadly chemicals.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.840
A fierce battle ensues.

05:58.840 --> 06:05.080
Nagleria fowleri can actually fight back, itself attacking and killing many immune cells.

06:05.080 --> 06:09.820
The immune system now throws everything it has at the invader, but in vain.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.800
The complement system, tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on their own, are

06:13.800 --> 06:15.640
easily disabled.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.200
Antibodies, usually one of your super weapons, are just destroyed or swallowed.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.520
A high fever that usually slows enemies down does nothing, as the amoeba actually thrives

06:25.520 --> 06:26.760
in the heat.

06:26.760 --> 06:32.440
All the while, the amoeba continue to multiply, fight, and devour your brain cells.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.040
A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.720
One major thing your immune cells do when they fight is to cause inflammation, which

06:40.720 --> 06:45.460
directs large amounts of fluid from your bloodstream into the site of an infection.

06:45.460 --> 06:50.900
So as the battle rages on without a clear winner, more and more fluid enters the brain.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.880
At this point, the human will feel symptoms that quickly escalate.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.220
It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

07:00.220 --> 07:05.100
As the battle spreads rapidly through the brain, serious symptoms appear, from confusion,

07:05.100 --> 07:10.100
inability to concentrate, to fatigue, seizures, and hallucinations.

07:10.100 --> 07:15.220
The brain swells up massively, but can't expand due to the bones surrounding it.

07:15.220 --> 07:20.840
So it compresses and disables the brainstem that controls things like breathing.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.060
Usually within a week, the patient dies.

07:24.060 --> 07:29.020
Up to 97% of the patients infected by the amoeba share this fate.

07:29.020 --> 07:34.040
In almost all cases, by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is recognized, the disastrous

07:34.040 --> 07:39.240
battle for the brain is already so far along that there is almost nothing to be done.

07:39.240 --> 07:43.220
Not only do we currently not have effective treatments, there are also an abundance of

07:43.220 --> 07:48.800
open questions about how an amoeba that usually enjoys its life in open water is able to overcome

07:48.800 --> 07:52.120
our immune system so effectively.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.620
So how worried do you need to be about this horrifying killer amoeba?

07:56.620 --> 07:58.920
Well, not very.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.860
While the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly, and the infection truly horrible,

08:03.860 --> 08:07.640
there have only been a few hundred cases in the last few decades.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.920
You are way more likely to drown in a pool than to get infected.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.800
Not only does the amoeba need to be flushed high up your nose, it also needs to get a

08:15.800 --> 08:20.400
good grip, and it also has to make its way through the first lines of your defenses.

08:20.400 --> 08:26.280
Ultimately, Naegleria fowleri is neither evil nor a huge public health risk.

08:26.280 --> 08:30.120
But every year, some unlucky people have to deal with it.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.720
We still have so much to learn about it, and until we find a way to treat it, Naegleria

08:34.720 --> 08:40.160
fowleri will continue to be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting in puddles and lakes,

08:40.160 --> 08:42.600
and sometimes pools.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.440
Usually for bacteria.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.600
And very occasionally, for people.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
Oh, hey.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
Who are you?

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
It's me.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
Your existential dread.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.920
Oh, okay.

08:58.920 --> 09:04.520
I'm here to make you question your own existence and everything you hold dear in life.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.920
Could you not, please?

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Too late.

09:06.920 --> 09:13.080
Just look at all these amazing posters full of humbling visualizations, like the scale

09:13.080 --> 09:14.560
of the universe.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.280
Look how huge it is and how small you are.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.720
Look at the Education Edition, how it dives deep into the history of evolution or all

09:24.720 --> 09:30.880
the other scientific fields to make you feel bad for all the stuff you don't know.

09:30.880 --> 09:35.000
Or look at this one, it glows in the dark.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.080
But dread, these do make me feel good, actually.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.920
They do fill me with excitement and awe about how amazing our universe is.

09:42.920 --> 09:46.520
And I love learning, and look how pretty they are.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.520
No!

09:47.760 --> 09:51.760
I can't persist in the presence of war!

09:54.760 --> 10:00.320
If you too want to overcome your existential dread, make your life beautiful and also support

10:00.320 --> 10:05.320
Kurzgesagt so we can put thousands of hours into our videos and release them for free,

10:05.320 --> 10:10.280
you can get these and many, many more amazing posters or shirts or so many more things in

10:10.280 --> 10:11.520
our shop.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.240
We put as much care into our products as into our videos, trying to find something clever

10:16.280 --> 10:20.760
or a new angle that will challenge your perspective while still teaching you the core aspects.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.320
It's the best way to support what we do on this channel.
