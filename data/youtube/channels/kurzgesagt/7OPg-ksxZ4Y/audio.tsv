0	6520	A war has been going on for billions of years that breeds well-armed monsters who struggle
6520	9260	with other monsters for survival.
9260	14400	Having no particular interest in us, most of them are relatively harmless, as our immune
14400	17520	systems deal with their weapons easily.
17520	19920	But there are exceptions.
19920	26340	Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba that has not only developed a deadly taste for human brains,
26340	31820	but is also a match for our defenses and stars in dramatic headlines.
31820	43260	What happens when this monster enters your body?
43260	49000	Nagleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a nucleus, one of the smallest life forms
49000	50580	on Earth.
50580	55860	It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other critters that it devours whole and rips into
55860	57460	pieces.
57460	62900	Like many amoebae, it is able to transform into different stages that help it survive.
62900	67460	But most of the time, Nagleria fowleri is in its trophozoite stage, during which it
67460	73740	looks like a squishy blob with tiny arms, and hunts, divides, and thrives.
73740	78880	Its natural home is in freshwater, ponds, rivers, lakes, and hot springs.
78880	84580	But unfortunately, it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools, fountains, or spas
84580	86820	when they are not properly treated.
86820	90580	The warmer the water, the more it thrives and multiplies.
90580	95300	So in the summer, when humans seek to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances are
95300	99220	highest that both species will interact.
99220	103140	Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of people regularly have contact with the
103140	108020	amoeba, especially in warmer climates, and many people even seem to have antibodies against
108020	109020	it.
109020	113360	And this is mostly okay, you can even swallow it without consequences.
113360	118040	Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water contaminated with the amoeba, and
118040	120980	water splashes high up into their noses.
120980	126180	In a single drop of lake water, there are millions of viruses, bacteria, and amoebae,
126180	128500	and that isn't really a big deal.
128500	131600	But Nagleria fowleri is different.
131600	136180	Let's zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim enjoying a great summer day, and see
136180	139240	what happens.
139240	142800	First of all, the amoeba doesn't really want to be inside your nose, as it's not really
142800	146080	looking for trouble, it just wants to eat a few bacteria.
146080	149960	Instead, it's greeted by your natural defenses.
149960	154500	Unfortunately for humans, Nagleria fowleri happens to be exceptionally good at generally
154500	157900	flying under the radar of your immune system.
157900	162580	For example, the inside of your nose is covered by mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that
162580	166860	kill or stun possible invaders, or alert immune cells.
166860	172040	But Nagleria fowleri is not particularly bothered by them, and instead calmly checks out the
172080	175440	scenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal.
175440	181320	Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny critter stumbles over something that actually sparks
181320	183060	its interest.
183060	184800	Nerve cells.
184800	189160	Your nose is filled with a large network of olfactory nerve cells that pick up molecules
189160	194320	from the outside and transmit their information to your olfactory bulb, the center of smell
194320	195840	in your brain.
195840	200320	To do their job, these cells talk to each other by releasing various messenger chemicals
200640	204000	and recognizing them via specific receptors.
204000	208360	One of the most important of these chemicals is acetylcholine.
208360	214560	Through sheer evolutionary bad luck, Nagleria fowleri happens to have receptors that recognize
214560	219560	acetylcholine, and it seems to attract them irresistibly, a little like moths that are
219560	221840	attracted by light.
221840	226440	So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job, using plenty of acetylcholine to talk
226440	230040	to the brain, Nagleria fowleri enters your tissue.
230760	233280	It seems to follow the chemical signals upstream.
233280	237960	Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors, begin to attack the amoebae.
237960	242720	Individually they have no chance against them, as the invaders are large and pretty buff
242720	246100	fighters used to dealing with tough enemies.
246100	250520	So the defenders swarm the intruders and kill them either by vomiting chemicals that punch
250520	255540	holes into them, or by literally ripping parts of them off and devouring them.
255620	259880	But the Nagleria fowleri train is still on track, and while the neutrophil attacks slow
259880	267220	them down, they continue to follow the olfactory nerves to their final destination, your brain.
267220	271340	This process can take between one and nine days, and you'll probably not notice anything
271340	276740	during that time, until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the center of smell and
276740	278900	entrance to your brain.
278900	283900	Your brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims, and they all release that wonderful
283900	286300	acetylcholine.
286300	292740	Nagleria fowleri initiates a massacre and releases an onslaught of various attack molecules.
292740	296700	Some of them are basically little bombs that rip holes into your cells on contact so their
296700	299240	pieces can be eagerly consumed.
299240	304680	But Nagleria fowleri is now multiplying, and it's also becoming really creepy.
304680	308860	In a feeding frenzy, it can develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups that look
308860	311480	like giant, eerie mouths.
311480	316800	The amoebae engage your brain cells, suck them in, and rip large bites out of them while
316800	318580	they're still alive.
318580	323600	Now things escalate quickly, and the disease that will kill you sets in.
323600	329800	Alerted by the massacre, millions of immune cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and microglias
329800	332160	invade the infected tissue.
332160	333280	Which is a problem.
333280	337880	Your immune system is dangerous, and not exactly a careful fighter.
337880	341560	It's like burning down a forest to kill the wolves inside it.
341560	344700	A really bad idea in the brain.
344700	349280	They waste no time and attack the amoeba, using all the weapons available to them, from
349280	352600	chemicals to trying to eat them alive.
352600	356920	Neutrophils explode themselves to erect barriers spiked with deadly chemicals.
356920	358840	A fierce battle ensues.
358840	365080	Nagleria fowleri can actually fight back, itself attacking and killing many immune cells.
365080	369820	The immune system now throws everything it has at the invader, but in vain.
369820	373800	The complement system, tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on their own, are
373800	375640	easily disabled.
375640	380200	Antibodies, usually one of your super weapons, are just destroyed or swallowed.
380200	385520	A high fever that usually slows enemies down does nothing, as the amoeba actually thrives
385520	386760	in the heat.
386760	392440	All the while, the amoeba continue to multiply, fight, and devour your brain cells.
392440	396040	A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.
396040	400720	One major thing your immune cells do when they fight is to cause inflammation, which
400720	405460	directs large amounts of fluid from your bloodstream into the site of an infection.
405460	410900	So as the battle rages on without a clear winner, more and more fluid enters the brain.
410900	414880	At this point, the human will feel symptoms that quickly escalate.
414880	420220	It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
420220	425100	As the battle spreads rapidly through the brain, serious symptoms appear, from confusion,
425100	430100	inability to concentrate, to fatigue, seizures, and hallucinations.
430100	435220	The brain swells up massively, but can't expand due to the bones surrounding it.
435220	440840	So it compresses and disables the brainstem that controls things like breathing.
440840	444060	Usually within a week, the patient dies.
444060	449020	Up to 97% of the patients infected by the amoeba share this fate.
449020	454040	In almost all cases, by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is recognized, the disastrous
454040	459240	battle for the brain is already so far along that there is almost nothing to be done.
459240	463220	Not only do we currently not have effective treatments, there are also an abundance of
463220	468800	open questions about how an amoeba that usually enjoys its life in open water is able to overcome
468800	472120	our immune system so effectively.
472120	476620	So how worried do you need to be about this horrifying killer amoeba?
476620	478920	Well, not very.
478920	483860	While the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly, and the infection truly horrible,
483860	487640	there have only been a few hundred cases in the last few decades.
487640	491920	You are way more likely to drown in a pool than to get infected.
491920	495800	Not only does the amoeba need to be flushed high up your nose, it also needs to get a
495800	500400	good grip, and it also has to make its way through the first lines of your defenses.
500400	506280	Ultimately, Naegleria fowleri is neither evil nor a huge public health risk.
506280	510120	But every year, some unlucky people have to deal with it.
510120	514720	We still have so much to learn about it, and until we find a way to treat it, Naegleria
514720	520160	fowleri will continue to be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting in puddles and lakes,
520160	522600	and sometimes pools.
522600	524440	Usually for bacteria.
524440	527600	And very occasionally, for people.
531600	532600	Oh, hey.
532600	533600	Who are you?
533920	534920	It's me.
534920	536920	Your existential dread.
536920	538920	Oh, okay.
538920	544520	I'm here to make you question your own existence and everything you hold dear in life.
544520	545920	Could you not, please?
545920	546920	Too late.
546920	553080	Just look at all these amazing posters full of humbling visualizations, like the scale
553080	554560	of the universe.
554560	559280	Look how huge it is and how small you are.
559960	564720	Look at the Education Edition, how it dives deep into the history of evolution or all
564720	570880	the other scientific fields to make you feel bad for all the stuff you don't know.
570880	575000	Or look at this one, it glows in the dark.
575000	578080	But dread, these do make me feel good, actually.
578080	582920	They do fill me with excitement and awe about how amazing our universe is.
582920	586520	And I love learning, and look how pretty they are.
586520	587520	No!
587760	591760	I can't persist in the presence of war!
