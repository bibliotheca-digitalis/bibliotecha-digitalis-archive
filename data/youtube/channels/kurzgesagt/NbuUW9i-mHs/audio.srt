1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Violence and war.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,520
The insane brutality of ISIS continues.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
The Russians are invading Ukraine, and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to slug

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
it out.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,880
Does that make you feel gloomy?

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,580
Well, don't.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,160
Because if you look at the numbers, war actually seems to be going out of fashion, while the

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,320
global population is at an all-time high.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,760
How is this possible?

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,240
As of September 2014, there were four conflicts going on in the world that had caused at least

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,600
10,000 people to die since January 2013.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,820
Nine conflicts that killed more than 1,000 people, and 13 that killed more than 100 since

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,840
January 2013.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Not really peaceful, but consider this.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Of all the conflicts going on, none is an active war between countries.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,400
They are either civil wars or local conflicts.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,000
Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering, their impact is usually way

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,540
smaller than a war between nations or empires.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,400
When two nations engage in war, they can mobilize much bigger forces, have access to all of

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,640
the state's resources and logistics, and almost to all of the population.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,640
So why have we transitioned from wars between nation-states to civil wars?

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,640
A lot of it is to do with colonialism and the Cold War.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,320
When the Cold War ended, a major driver of armed conflict vanished too.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,120
But the breakup of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions, and brought

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,680
new conflicts in the now-freed states, which often resulted in civil war.

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,760
Much more importantly, in 1945, nearly all of Africa, much of Asia, and parts of Latin

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,360
America were under colonial rule.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,920
By 1990, all but a few islands were independent.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,120
But wait, couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,880
third world is just as bad as colonialism?

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
Let's look at Congo.

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,420
It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgian king, an area 80 times the size

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,360
of Belgium.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,080
Events committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic exploitation

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,680
had killed about half of the population by 1908.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,480
About 10 million Congolese were executed or starved to death.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,400
Millions were mutilated and traumatized.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,120
The economic exploitation of the Congo remained the top priority, and forced labor never really

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,900
ceased completely until the end of Belgian rule in 1960.

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,640
Which is not really that long ago.

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,500
So no, colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today, and it ended just two

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,640
generations ago.

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,280
Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago were under

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
foreign control.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,640
But things are getting better.

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Until 1989, victory for one side in a civil war was common, while nowadays victories are

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
much rarer.

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,460
At the same time, negotiated endings have jumped from 10% to almost 40%.

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,260
What about the rest of the world?

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,200
Why have nation states stopped attacking each other?

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,340
There are four major reasons.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,560
One, democratization.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,600
The steady development from autocracy to democracy.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,940
Democracies hardly ever fight each other.

56
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,840
Of all the state-against-state wars fought since 1900, only a minority were fought between

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
democracies.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,080
Two, globalization.

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,840
War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,780
Today, it's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global market than to seize

61
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,520
them by force.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,280
People from other nations are more valuable to us alive than dead, which overall is a

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
pretty new concept.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,040
Three, war is so 20th century.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Until World War I, warfare was seen as an inevitable part of the human experience and

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,560
as a valuable tool which you could use to achieve goals when diplomacy hit a brick wall.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,400
Today, we have rules that declare acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that armed

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,840
force is only justified in self-defense or with the authority of the UN Security Council.

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,920
These rules are still broken, but today it's harder to do so without sparking opposition

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
and disapproval.

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Also, we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague, and that's a very recent

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
innovation.

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Four, borders are mostly fixed now.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,320
After World War II, territorial wars generally stopped when most countries pledged to accept

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,320
international borders and respect other nations' autonomy.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,800
But is all of this just an anomaly, or are we on the road to lasting peace?

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Truth is, we don't know yet.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,360
We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average, which is about one or

79
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
two big wars per century.

80
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,280
We just haven't had enough time since World War II to rule out the possibility that war

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,840
is not going away.

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,640
If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years, we can be really confident that

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
humanity is changing.

84
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
So you see, war might be over.

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,680
Yes, there are nasty conflicts going on in many places, but overall, things are getting

86
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360
better, and we can make them even better by speaking up for peace and democracy.
