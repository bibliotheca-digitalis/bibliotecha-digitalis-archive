00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
Violence and war.

00:02.560 --> 00:05.520
The insane brutality of ISIS continues.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.000
The Russians are invading Ukraine, and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to slug

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
it out.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.880
Does that make you feel gloomy?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.580
Well, don't.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.160
Because if you look at the numbers, war actually seems to be going out of fashion, while the

00:19.160 --> 00:22.320
global population is at an all-time high.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.240
It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.760
How is this possible?

00:34.560 --> 00:39.240
As of September 2014, there were four conflicts going on in the world that had caused at least

00:39.240 --> 00:42.600
10,000 people to die since January 2013.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.820
Nine conflicts that killed more than 1,000 people, and 13 that killed more than 100 since

00:47.820 --> 00:49.840
January 2013.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.400
Not really peaceful, but consider this.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.960
Of all the conflicts going on, none is an active war between countries.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.400
They are either civil wars or local conflicts.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.000
Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering, their impact is usually way

01:05.000 --> 01:08.540
smaller than a war between nations or empires.

01:08.540 --> 01:14.400
When two nations engage in war, they can mobilize much bigger forces, have access to all of

01:14.400 --> 01:19.640
the state's resources and logistics, and almost to all of the population.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.640
So why have we transitioned from wars between nation-states to civil wars?

01:24.640 --> 01:29.640
A lot of it is to do with colonialism and the Cold War.

01:29.640 --> 01:34.320
When the Cold War ended, a major driver of armed conflict vanished too.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.120
But the breakup of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions, and brought

01:39.120 --> 01:44.680
new conflicts in the now-freed states, which often resulted in civil war.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.760
Much more importantly, in 1945, nearly all of Africa, much of Asia, and parts of Latin

01:50.760 --> 01:53.360
America were under colonial rule.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.920
By 1990, all but a few islands were independent.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.120
But wait, couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the

02:02.120 --> 02:04.880
third world is just as bad as colonialism?

02:04.880 --> 02:07.040
Let's look at Congo.

02:07.040 --> 02:12.420
It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgian king, an area 80 times the size

02:12.420 --> 02:14.360
of Belgium.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.080
Events committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic exploitation

02:19.080 --> 02:23.680
had killed about half of the population by 1908.

02:23.680 --> 02:28.480
About 10 million Congolese were executed or starved to death.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.400
Millions were mutilated and traumatized.

02:31.400 --> 02:37.120
The economic exploitation of the Congo remained the top priority, and forced labor never really

02:37.120 --> 02:41.900
ceased completely until the end of Belgian rule in 1960.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.640
Which is not really that long ago.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.500
So no, colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today, and it ended just two

02:50.500 --> 02:52.640
generations ago.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.280
Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago were under

02:57.280 --> 02:59.320
foreign control.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.640
But things are getting better.

03:01.640 --> 03:07.440
Until 1989, victory for one side in a civil war was common, while nowadays victories are

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
much rarer.

03:08.820 --> 03:14.460
At the same time, negotiated endings have jumped from 10% to almost 40%.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.260
What about the rest of the world?

03:16.260 --> 03:19.200
Why have nation states stopped attacking each other?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.340
There are four major reasons.

03:21.340 --> 03:23.560
One, democratization.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.600
The steady development from autocracy to democracy.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.940
Democracies hardly ever fight each other.

03:29.940 --> 03:35.840
Of all the state-against-state wars fought since 1900, only a minority were fought between

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
democracies.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.080
Two, globalization.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.840
War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.780
Today, it's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global market than to seize

03:48.780 --> 03:50.520
them by force.

03:50.520 --> 03:56.280
People from other nations are more valuable to us alive than dead, which overall is a

03:56.280 --> 03:57.840
pretty new concept.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.040
Three, war is so 20th century.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.320
Until World War I, warfare was seen as an inevitable part of the human experience and

04:07.320 --> 04:12.560
as a valuable tool which you could use to achieve goals when diplomacy hit a brick wall.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.400
Today, we have rules that declare acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that armed

04:17.400 --> 04:23.840
force is only justified in self-defense or with the authority of the UN Security Council.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.920
These rules are still broken, but today it's harder to do so without sparking opposition

04:28.920 --> 04:30.120
and disapproval.

04:30.200 --> 04:36.200
Also, we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague, and that's a very recent

04:36.200 --> 04:37.200
innovation.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.200
Four, borders are mostly fixed now.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.320
After World War II, territorial wars generally stopped when most countries pledged to accept

04:46.320 --> 04:50.320
international borders and respect other nations' autonomy.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.800
But is all of this just an anomaly, or are we on the road to lasting peace?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
Truth is, we don't know yet.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.360
We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average, which is about one or

05:00.360 --> 05:02.160
two big wars per century.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.280
We just haven't had enough time since World War II to rule out the possibility that war

05:06.280 --> 05:07.840
is not going away.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.640
If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years, we can be really confident that

05:12.640 --> 05:14.640
humanity is changing.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.280
So you see, war might be over.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.680
Yes, there are nasty conflicts going on in many places, but overall, things are getting

05:21.680 --> 05:26.360
better, and we can make them even better by speaking up for peace and democracy.
