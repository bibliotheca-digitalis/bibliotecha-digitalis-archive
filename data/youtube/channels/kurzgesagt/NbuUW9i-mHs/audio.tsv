0	2560	Violence and war.
2560	5520	The insane brutality of ISIS continues.
5520	10000	The Russians are invading Ukraine, and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to slug
10000	11000	it out.
11000	12880	Does that make you feel gloomy?
12880	14580	Well, don't.
14580	19160	Because if you look at the numbers, war actually seems to be going out of fashion, while the
19160	22320	global population is at an all-time high.
22320	26240	It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history.
26240	27760	How is this possible?
34560	39240	As of September 2014, there were four conflicts going on in the world that had caused at least
39240	42600	10,000 people to die since January 2013.
42600	47820	Nine conflicts that killed more than 1,000 people, and 13 that killed more than 100 since
47820	49840	January 2013.
49840	52400	Not really peaceful, but consider this.
52400	56960	Of all the conflicts going on, none is an active war between countries.
56960	60400	They are either civil wars or local conflicts.
60400	65000	Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering, their impact is usually way
65000	68540	smaller than a war between nations or empires.
68540	74400	When two nations engage in war, they can mobilize much bigger forces, have access to all of
74400	79640	the state's resources and logistics, and almost to all of the population.
79640	84640	So why have we transitioned from wars between nation-states to civil wars?
84640	89640	A lot of it is to do with colonialism and the Cold War.
89640	94320	When the Cold War ended, a major driver of armed conflict vanished too.
94320	99120	But the breakup of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions, and brought
99120	104680	new conflicts in the now-freed states, which often resulted in civil war.
104720	110760	Much more importantly, in 1945, nearly all of Africa, much of Asia, and parts of Latin
110760	113360	America were under colonial rule.
113360	116920	By 1990, all but a few islands were independent.
116920	122120	But wait, couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the
122120	124880	third world is just as bad as colonialism?
124880	127040	Let's look at Congo.
127040	132420	It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgian king, an area 80 times the size
132420	134360	of Belgium.
134360	139080	Events committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic exploitation
139080	143680	had killed about half of the population by 1908.
143680	148480	About 10 million Congolese were executed or starved to death.
148480	151400	Millions were mutilated and traumatized.
151400	157120	The economic exploitation of the Congo remained the top priority, and forced labor never really
157120	161900	ceased completely until the end of Belgian rule in 1960.
161940	164640	Which is not really that long ago.
164640	170500	So no, colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today, and it ended just two
170500	172640	generations ago.
172640	177280	Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago were under
177280	179320	foreign control.
179320	181640	But things are getting better.
181640	187440	Until 1989, victory for one side in a civil war was common, while nowadays victories are
187440	188440	much rarer.
188820	194460	At the same time, negotiated endings have jumped from 10% to almost 40%.
194460	196260	What about the rest of the world?
196260	199200	Why have nation states stopped attacking each other?
199200	201340	There are four major reasons.
201340	203560	One, democratization.
203560	207600	The steady development from autocracy to democracy.
207600	209940	Democracies hardly ever fight each other.
209940	215840	Of all the state-against-state wars fought since 1900, only a minority were fought between
215840	216840	democracies.
217240	219080	Two, globalization.
219080	223840	War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be.
223840	228780	Today, it's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global market than to seize
228780	230520	them by force.
230520	236280	People from other nations are more valuable to us alive than dead, which overall is a
236280	237840	pretty new concept.
237840	242040	Three, war is so 20th century.
242040	247320	Until World War I, warfare was seen as an inevitable part of the human experience and
247320	252560	as a valuable tool which you could use to achieve goals when diplomacy hit a brick wall.
252560	257400	Today, we have rules that declare acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that armed
257400	263840	force is only justified in self-defense or with the authority of the UN Security Council.
263840	268920	These rules are still broken, but today it's harder to do so without sparking opposition
268920	270120	and disapproval.
270200	276200	Also, we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague, and that's a very recent
276200	277200	innovation.
277200	281200	Four, borders are mostly fixed now.
281200	286320	After World War II, territorial wars generally stopped when most countries pledged to accept
286320	290320	international borders and respect other nations' autonomy.
290320	294800	But is all of this just an anomaly, or are we on the road to lasting peace?
294800	296800	Truth is, we don't know yet.
296800	300360	We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average, which is about one or
300360	302160	two big wars per century.
302160	306280	We just haven't had enough time since World War II to rule out the possibility that war
306280	307840	is not going away.
307840	312640	If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years, we can be really confident that
312640	314640	humanity is changing.
314640	317280	So you see, war might be over.
317280	321680	Yes, there are nasty conflicts going on in many places, but overall, things are getting
321680	326360	better, and we can make them even better by speaking up for peace and democracy.
