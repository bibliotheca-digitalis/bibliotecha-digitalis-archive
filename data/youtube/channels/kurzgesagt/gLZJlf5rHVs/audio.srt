1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,680
The night sky seems peaceful and orderly.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,360
But in reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,960
of kilometers per hour. Not bound by static formations, but changing neighborhoods constantly.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,640
Fortunately, space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,520
Unfortunately, they don't have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on Earth.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,680
And there are already stars starting to get very close.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
To understand how dangerous stars are to us, we need to talk about gravity.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Gravity attracts every piece of matter to every other piece of matter in the universe.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
You are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Luckily, this force gets weaker over distance, and it also depends on how massive something is.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
So things that are close and are very massive are more attractive,

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,280
winning the cosmic tug of war. This way, massive things define how smaller things behave around

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,880
them. The Sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system, and so it shapes the behavior

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,160
and orbits of everything else in it. Billions of years ago, after the Sun was born, the solar

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,640
system was a chaotic and dangerous place, as the planets were formed from countless little pieces

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,880
that collided constantly. But over the eons, a stable balance emerged. Today, most planets

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits. We have the inner and outer

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,240
planets, the asteroid and Kuiper belt, and at the edge, the Oort cloud, a giant sphere of comets

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
orbiting slowly in cold storage. We really don't want this balance to be disturbed.

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,280
If another star came too close to us, its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,080
a spoiled toddler, messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,000
This isn't some imaginary danger. Some 70,000 years ago, a red dwarf-brown dwarf binary system

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,440
passed through the Oort cloud and messed things up. It might even have sent a deadly onslaught

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,560
of asteroids our way. But it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the Oort cloud

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
arrive in the inner solar system. But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon.

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,240
Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun, is currently headed towards the solar

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,120
system. In about a million years, it'll pass through the Oort cloud and become the brightest

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,520
star in the night sky. A close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years,

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,120
disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the Oort cloud considerably.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
If we're unlucky, it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment,

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,280
similar to the early solar system. The night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,440
raining down on the inner solar system. The larger ones could cause dinosaur-level mass extinctions

33
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,360
and would be bad for the stock market. But it could get much worse. The galaxy is an

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,200
intense place, and stars get close to each other regularly. So it is possible that a star could

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,320
come much closer and not just pass us, but fly directly through the inner solar system.

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,800
This would be very bad in the extreme. The chance of another star colliding with the Sun

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
is astronomically unlikely, but that isn't what we're worried about.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,640
If another star were to pass by about as close as the Earth is from the Sun, it could easily eject

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,200
the Earth from the solar system. The odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,080
in the next 5 billion years. Small, but not absurdly so. As we discussed in another video,

41
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,160
there seem to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing in the galaxy,

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,120
and this is one way to make them. So if this were to happen with an average red dwarf,

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,680
what would happen on Earth? Kicking Earth out of the solar system.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,000
As the star enters the solar system, a small orange-ish dot appears in the sky that grows

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,520
bigger and bigger for months, eventually becoming visible during the day. It would get bigger and

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,760
much brighter than the Moon. Too bright to look at directly. The night sky would be filled with an

47
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,680
eerie red glow. After a few months, it would start shrinking again. But so would the Sun.

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,080
Over a few years, the Sun slowly grows smaller in the sky, and with it warmth and light start

49
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,760
to dissipate. All around the world, as the days turn dark, the final winter of humanity

50
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,920
would begin. The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread, while plants shrivel and die.

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Forests freeze, and animals die in droves. As the Earth passes the orbit of Mars,

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,640
the average surface temperature has plummeted to near minus 50 degrees Celsius.

53
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,360
From space, Earth begins to look like an icy Moon, the blue-green surface becoming the pale

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,600
gray-white of death. As global infrastructure breaks down, people huddle together indoors,

55
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,200
burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop,

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,720
counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows.

57
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time. By the time Earth reaches

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,200
Jupiter's orbit, surface temperatures sink to minus 150 degrees Celsius, lower than the coldest

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,760
ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica. Needless to say, by now, almost everyone is dead.

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
Without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water, clouds don't form,

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,240
and the water cycle stops. The polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator,

62
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,920
and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice. As more and more of its heat leaks out,

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,000
more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet, the concentration of salt in the

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,480
deep ocean grows, poisoning most animals that survived here. Although around hydrothermal vents,

65
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,880
communities of extremophiles might adapt even to these circumstances. Deep below the surface,

66
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,040
some bacteria would not notice much of any of this, as they're still kept warm by the

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,120
radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core. As the Earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
Kuiper Belt, the Sun is still the brightest star in the sky, but it's one among many, with stars

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,880
now visible during the day. The temperature is now barely 40 degrees Celsius above absolute zero,

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,760
below the freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere. A weird spectacle, enjoyed by no one

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,880
unfortunately, unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen snow. Over a few years,

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,080
it's deposited into an icy 10 meter thick sheet all over the planet's surface, with only a thin

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,480
whisper of gas remaining. The frozen corpses of flora and fauna are buried beneath them.

74
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,040
As Earth leaves the solar system, it becomes a rogue planet, traveling alone through the dark,

75
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:07,440
lifeless and in solitude. But weirdly enough, there is hope. Humanity would not be surprised

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,600
by this potential extinction event. We'd notice it thousands of years in advance. There's not a lot we

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,000
could do to stop a star, but we could prepare. Most of us would perish, but a few million could

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,920
survive in huge artificial complexes powered by geothermal and nuclear energy, possibly even

79
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,760
fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power. Here, humanity might survive for

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,040
hundreds of thousands of years. At some point, we would become used to our circumstances and

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,400
new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,840
and could walk the surface of Earth. And at some point, we might decide to look for another home.

83
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,480
If the Earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet,

84
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,840
we could try to make a fresh start. Space flight, oddly enough, would become very easy without the

85
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,280
atmosphere in the way. So it's not unthinkable that the last survivors would leave Earth behind

86
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,760
and try again on a new planet around a new star. Maybe one day, thousands of years later,

87
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,160
the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past. Stories of our lost

88
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,600
home, of a mysterious icy planet, floating alone and empty through the dark of space.

89
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,800
So basically, the key to humanity's survival is learning about what we'll be dealing with.

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,280
