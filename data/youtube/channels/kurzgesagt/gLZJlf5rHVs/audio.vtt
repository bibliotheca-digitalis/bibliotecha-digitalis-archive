00:00.880 --> 00:03.680
The night sky seems peaceful and orderly.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.360
But in reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands

00:09.360 --> 00:14.960
of kilometers per hour. Not bound by static formations, but changing neighborhoods constantly.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.640
Fortunately, space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.520
Unfortunately, they don't have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on Earth.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.680
And there are already stars starting to get very close.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.480
To understand how dangerous stars are to us, we need to talk about gravity.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.200
Gravity attracts every piece of matter to every other piece of matter in the universe.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.520
You are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.120
Luckily, this force gets weaker over distance, and it also depends on how massive something is.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.600
So things that are close and are very massive are more attractive,

01:01.600 --> 01:07.280
winning the cosmic tug of war. This way, massive things define how smaller things behave around

01:07.280 --> 01:14.880
them. The Sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system, and so it shapes the behavior

01:14.880 --> 01:20.160
and orbits of everything else in it. Billions of years ago, after the Sun was born, the solar

01:20.160 --> 01:24.640
system was a chaotic and dangerous place, as the planets were formed from countless little pieces

01:24.640 --> 01:30.880
that collided constantly. But over the eons, a stable balance emerged. Today, most planets

01:30.880 --> 01:35.920
and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits. We have the inner and outer

01:35.920 --> 01:42.240
planets, the asteroid and Kuiper belt, and at the edge, the Oort cloud, a giant sphere of comets

01:42.240 --> 01:47.360
orbiting slowly in cold storage. We really don't want this balance to be disturbed.

01:48.320 --> 01:53.280
If another star came too close to us, its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like

01:53.280 --> 01:58.080
a spoiled toddler, messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets.

01:59.200 --> 02:06.000
This isn't some imaginary danger. Some 70,000 years ago, a red dwarf-brown dwarf binary system

02:06.000 --> 02:11.440
passed through the Oort cloud and messed things up. It might even have sent a deadly onslaught

02:11.440 --> 02:16.560
of asteroids our way. But it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the Oort cloud

02:17.040 --> 02:21.520
arrive in the inner solar system. But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon.

02:22.160 --> 02:28.240
Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun, is currently headed towards the solar

02:28.240 --> 02:33.120
system. In about a million years, it'll pass through the Oort cloud and become the brightest

02:33.120 --> 02:39.520
star in the night sky. A close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years,

02:39.520 --> 02:43.120
disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the Oort cloud considerably.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.080
If we're unlucky, it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment,

02:48.080 --> 02:53.280
similar to the early solar system. The night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids

02:53.280 --> 02:59.440
raining down on the inner solar system. The larger ones could cause dinosaur-level mass extinctions

02:59.440 --> 03:05.360
and would be bad for the stock market. But it could get much worse. The galaxy is an

03:05.360 --> 03:11.200
intense place, and stars get close to each other regularly. So it is possible that a star could

03:11.200 --> 03:16.320
come much closer and not just pass us, but fly directly through the inner solar system.

03:16.960 --> 03:22.800
This would be very bad in the extreme. The chance of another star colliding with the Sun

03:22.800 --> 03:26.480
is astronomically unlikely, but that isn't what we're worried about.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.640
If another star were to pass by about as close as the Earth is from the Sun, it could easily eject

03:32.640 --> 03:39.200
the Earth from the solar system. The odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000

03:39.200 --> 03:46.080
in the next 5 billion years. Small, but not absurdly so. As we discussed in another video,

03:46.080 --> 03:50.160
there seem to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing in the galaxy,

03:50.160 --> 03:55.120
and this is one way to make them. So if this were to happen with an average red dwarf,

03:55.120 --> 03:59.680
what would happen on Earth? Kicking Earth out of the solar system.

04:00.640 --> 04:06.000
As the star enters the solar system, a small orange-ish dot appears in the sky that grows

04:06.000 --> 04:11.520
bigger and bigger for months, eventually becoming visible during the day. It would get bigger and

04:11.520 --> 04:17.760
much brighter than the Moon. Too bright to look at directly. The night sky would be filled with an

04:17.760 --> 04:23.680
eerie red glow. After a few months, it would start shrinking again. But so would the Sun.

04:24.240 --> 04:30.080
Over a few years, the Sun slowly grows smaller in the sky, and with it warmth and light start

04:30.080 --> 04:35.760
to dissipate. All around the world, as the days turn dark, the final winter of humanity

04:35.760 --> 04:41.920
would begin. The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread, while plants shrivel and die.

04:42.720 --> 04:48.720
Forests freeze, and animals die in droves. As the Earth passes the orbit of Mars,

04:48.720 --> 04:52.640
the average surface temperature has plummeted to near minus 50 degrees Celsius.

04:53.440 --> 04:59.360
From space, Earth begins to look like an icy Moon, the blue-green surface becoming the pale

04:59.360 --> 05:05.600
gray-white of death. As global infrastructure breaks down, people huddle together indoors,

05:05.600 --> 05:09.200
burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop,

05:09.200 --> 05:12.720
counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.360
Everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time. By the time Earth reaches

05:19.360 --> 05:25.200
Jupiter's orbit, surface temperatures sink to minus 150 degrees Celsius, lower than the coldest

05:25.200 --> 05:31.760
ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica. Needless to say, by now, almost everyone is dead.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.280
Without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water, clouds don't form,

05:37.280 --> 05:42.240
and the water cycle stops. The polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator,

05:42.240 --> 05:47.920
and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice. As more and more of its heat leaks out,

05:47.920 --> 05:52.000
more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet, the concentration of salt in the

05:52.000 --> 05:58.480
deep ocean grows, poisoning most animals that survived here. Although around hydrothermal vents,

05:58.480 --> 06:04.880
communities of extremophiles might adapt even to these circumstances. Deep below the surface,

06:04.880 --> 06:09.040
some bacteria would not notice much of any of this, as they're still kept warm by the

06:09.040 --> 06:15.120
radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core. As the Earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the

06:15.120 --> 06:20.720
Kuiper Belt, the Sun is still the brightest star in the sky, but it's one among many, with stars

06:20.720 --> 06:26.880
now visible during the day. The temperature is now barely 40 degrees Celsius above absolute zero,

06:26.880 --> 06:33.760
below the freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere. A weird spectacle, enjoyed by no one

06:33.760 --> 06:40.880
unfortunately, unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen snow. Over a few years,

06:40.880 --> 06:46.080
it's deposited into an icy 10 meter thick sheet all over the planet's surface, with only a thin

06:46.080 --> 06:52.480
whisper of gas remaining. The frozen corpses of flora and fauna are buried beneath them.

06:52.480 --> 06:59.040
As Earth leaves the solar system, it becomes a rogue planet, traveling alone through the dark,

06:59.040 --> 07:07.440
lifeless and in solitude. But weirdly enough, there is hope. Humanity would not be surprised

07:07.440 --> 07:13.600
by this potential extinction event. We'd notice it thousands of years in advance. There's not a lot we

07:13.600 --> 07:20.000
could do to stop a star, but we could prepare. Most of us would perish, but a few million could

07:20.000 --> 07:25.920
survive in huge artificial complexes powered by geothermal and nuclear energy, possibly even

07:25.920 --> 07:31.760
fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power. Here, humanity might survive for

07:31.760 --> 07:37.040
hundreds of thousands of years. At some point, we would become used to our circumstances and

07:37.040 --> 07:42.400
new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star

07:42.400 --> 07:47.840
and could walk the surface of Earth. And at some point, we might decide to look for another home.

07:48.640 --> 07:52.480
If the Earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet,

07:52.480 --> 07:57.840
we could try to make a fresh start. Space flight, oddly enough, would become very easy without the

07:57.840 --> 08:03.280
atmosphere in the way. So it's not unthinkable that the last survivors would leave Earth behind

08:03.280 --> 08:09.760
and try again on a new planet around a new star. Maybe one day, thousands of years later,

08:09.760 --> 08:16.160
the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past. Stories of our lost

08:16.160 --> 08:23.600
home, of a mysterious icy planet, floating alone and empty through the dark of space.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.800
So basically, the key to humanity's survival is learning about what we'll be dealing with.

08:30.800 --> 08:35.280
