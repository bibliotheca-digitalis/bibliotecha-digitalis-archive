880	3680	The night sky seems peaceful and orderly.
4480	9360	But in reality, stars are careening through the galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands
9360	14960	of kilometers per hour. Not bound by static formations, but changing neighborhoods constantly.
15600	20640	Fortunately, space is big, and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us.
21280	25520	Unfortunately, they don't have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on Earth.
26240	29680	And there are already stars starting to get very close.
38480	42480	To understand how dangerous stars are to us, we need to talk about gravity.
43200	47200	Gravity attracts every piece of matter to every other piece of matter in the universe.
47840	51520	You are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa.
52320	57120	Luckily, this force gets weaker over distance, and it also depends on how massive something is.
58000	61600	So things that are close and are very massive are more attractive,
61600	67280	winning the cosmic tug of war. This way, massive things define how smaller things behave around
67280	74880	them. The Sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system, and so it shapes the behavior
74880	80160	and orbits of everything else in it. Billions of years ago, after the Sun was born, the solar
80160	84640	system was a chaotic and dangerous place, as the planets were formed from countless little pieces
84640	90880	that collided constantly. But over the eons, a stable balance emerged. Today, most planets
90880	95920	and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits. We have the inner and outer
95920	102240	planets, the asteroid and Kuiper belt, and at the edge, the Oort cloud, a giant sphere of comets
102240	107360	orbiting slowly in cold storage. We really don't want this balance to be disturbed.
108320	113280	If another star came too close to us, its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like
113280	118080	a spoiled toddler, messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets.
119200	126000	This isn't some imaginary danger. Some 70,000 years ago, a red dwarf-brown dwarf binary system
126000	131440	passed through the Oort cloud and messed things up. It might even have sent a deadly onslaught
131440	136560	of asteroids our way. But it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the Oort cloud
137040	141520	arrive in the inner solar system. But there's a much bigger problem on the horizon.
142160	148240	Gliese 710, a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun, is currently headed towards the solar
148240	153120	system. In about a million years, it'll pass through the Oort cloud and become the brightest
153120	159520	star in the night sky. A close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years,
159520	163120	disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the Oort cloud considerably.
164000	168080	If we're unlucky, it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment,
168080	173280	similar to the early solar system. The night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids
173280	179440	raining down on the inner solar system. The larger ones could cause dinosaur-level mass extinctions
179440	185360	and would be bad for the stock market. But it could get much worse. The galaxy is an
185360	191200	intense place, and stars get close to each other regularly. So it is possible that a star could
191200	196320	come much closer and not just pass us, but fly directly through the inner solar system.
196960	202800	This would be very bad in the extreme. The chance of another star colliding with the Sun
202800	206480	is astronomically unlikely, but that isn't what we're worried about.
207440	212640	If another star were to pass by about as close as the Earth is from the Sun, it could easily eject
212640	219200	the Earth from the solar system. The odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000
219200	226080	in the next 5 billion years. Small, but not absurdly so. As we discussed in another video,
226080	230160	there seem to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing in the galaxy,
230160	235120	and this is one way to make them. So if this were to happen with an average red dwarf,
235120	239680	what would happen on Earth? Kicking Earth out of the solar system.
240640	246000	As the star enters the solar system, a small orange-ish dot appears in the sky that grows
246000	251520	bigger and bigger for months, eventually becoming visible during the day. It would get bigger and
251520	257760	much brighter than the Moon. Too bright to look at directly. The night sky would be filled with an
257760	263680	eerie red glow. After a few months, it would start shrinking again. But so would the Sun.
264240	270080	Over a few years, the Sun slowly grows smaller in the sky, and with it warmth and light start
270080	275760	to dissipate. All around the world, as the days turn dark, the final winter of humanity
275760	281920	would begin. The polar ice caps begin to grow and spread, while plants shrivel and die.
282720	288720	Forests freeze, and animals die in droves. As the Earth passes the orbit of Mars,
288720	292640	the average surface temperature has plummeted to near minus 50 degrees Celsius.
293440	299360	From space, Earth begins to look like an icy Moon, the blue-green surface becoming the pale
299360	305600	gray-white of death. As global infrastructure breaks down, people huddle together indoors,
305600	309200	burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop,
309200	312720	counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows.
313520	319360	Everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time. By the time Earth reaches
319360	325200	Jupiter's orbit, surface temperatures sink to minus 150 degrees Celsius, lower than the coldest
325200	331760	ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica. Needless to say, by now, almost everyone is dead.
333120	337280	Without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water, clouds don't form,
337280	342240	and the water cycle stops. The polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator,
342240	347920	and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice. As more and more of its heat leaks out,
347920	352000	more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet, the concentration of salt in the
352000	358480	deep ocean grows, poisoning most animals that survived here. Although around hydrothermal vents,
358480	364880	communities of extremophiles might adapt even to these circumstances. Deep below the surface,
364880	369040	some bacteria would not notice much of any of this, as they're still kept warm by the
369040	375120	radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core. As the Earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the
375120	380720	Kuiper Belt, the Sun is still the brightest star in the sky, but it's one among many, with stars
380720	386880	now visible during the day. The temperature is now barely 40 degrees Celsius above absolute zero,
386880	393760	below the freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere. A weird spectacle, enjoyed by no one
393760	400880	unfortunately, unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen snow. Over a few years,
400880	406080	it's deposited into an icy 10 meter thick sheet all over the planet's surface, with only a thin
406080	412480	whisper of gas remaining. The frozen corpses of flora and fauna are buried beneath them.
412480	419040	As Earth leaves the solar system, it becomes a rogue planet, traveling alone through the dark,
419040	427440	lifeless and in solitude. But weirdly enough, there is hope. Humanity would not be surprised
427440	433600	by this potential extinction event. We'd notice it thousands of years in advance. There's not a lot we
433600	440000	could do to stop a star, but we could prepare. Most of us would perish, but a few million could
440000	445920	survive in huge artificial complexes powered by geothermal and nuclear energy, possibly even
445920	451760	fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power. Here, humanity might survive for
451760	457040	hundreds of thousands of years. At some point, we would become used to our circumstances and
457040	462400	new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star
462400	467840	and could walk the surface of Earth. And at some point, we might decide to look for another home.
468640	472480	If the Earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet,
472480	477840	we could try to make a fresh start. Space flight, oddly enough, would become very easy without the
477840	483280	atmosphere in the way. So it's not unthinkable that the last survivors would leave Earth behind
483280	489760	and try again on a new planet around a new star. Maybe one day, thousands of years later,
489760	496160	the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past. Stories of our lost
496160	503600	home, of a mysterious icy planet, floating alone and empty through the dark of space.
505200	510800	So basically, the key to humanity's survival is learning about what we'll be dealing with.
