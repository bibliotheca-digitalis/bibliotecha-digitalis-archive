00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Neutron stars are the densest things that are not black holes.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Strange matter.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
A bizarre thing so extreme that it bends the rules of the universe

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Or it could teach us about how the universe began.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Maybe both.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe?

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
To get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things,

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
When this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
All the nothing inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
that really don't want to be close to each other, but have no choice.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
If gravity wins, they will become a black hole.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
If they win, they become a neutron star.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
but holding the mass of our sun.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And here, things get weird.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
are made up of smaller particles called quarks.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Quarks really don't want to be alone.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
They are what we call confined.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
You can try to separate them, but the harder you pull,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
the harder they try to pull themselves back together.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
If you use a lot of energy, they just use a lot of energy.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
They just use this energy to create new quarks.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
and have never been observed by themselves.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
The up and down quarks found in protons and neutrons.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
All other quarks seem to decay away quickly.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
But this may be different inside neutron stars.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
The forces operating in their cores are so extreme

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Neutron star cores are like fossils,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
One hypothesis is that inside a neutron star core,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
protons and neutrons de-confine.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
All the particles crammed shoulder to shoulder

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
made purely from quarks.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Quark matter.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
A star made from this is called a quark star,

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
though from the outside it may not look any different than a regular neutron star.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Now we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
it may get stranger.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Literally.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
In the cores of neutron stars,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
some of the quarks may be converted into strange quarks.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
If they turn up, they could create strange matter.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
More stable than any other matter in the universe.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
If this is the case, we have a problem.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It might be infectious.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
that it would immediately turn it into strange matter too.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
which frees energy and creates more strange matter.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But then again, who cares?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
All of it is inside neutron stars.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars, or black holes,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
they spew out tremendous amounts of their insides,

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
They could be really small, maybe even subatomic,

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
but even the largest strangelets wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
until they meet a star or planet by chance.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
If one were to strike Earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
The more it converts, the more it would grow.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Ultimately, all of the atoms making up Earth would be converted.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter the size of an asteroid.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
If a strangelet strikes the Sun, it would collapse into a strange star,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
eating through it like fire through a dry forest.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
This would not change the Sun's mass much,

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
but it would become way less bright, so Earth would freeze to death.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
And like a tiny virus, we'd have no way to see a strangelet coming.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
outnumbering all stars in the galaxy.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
These strangelets could have formed very early after the Big Bang,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
as the universe expanded and evolved.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
But then again, maybe not.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
This is speculation, and the Earth and Sun and planets

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
haven't been consumed in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
so the odds seem good that it won't happen anytime soon.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Understanding these strange objects today

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
and why it grew to look the way it does now.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
and thinking about electrons,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
The scientists thinking about the cores of neutron stars and strange matter today

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Or maybe not. Time will tell.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
you might still want to find out more about it.
