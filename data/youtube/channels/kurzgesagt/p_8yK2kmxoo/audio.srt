1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Neutron stars are the densest things that are not black holes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Strange matter.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A bizarre thing so extreme that it bends the rules of the universe

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Or it could teach us about how the universe began.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Maybe both.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
To get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All the nothing inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that really don't want to be close to each other, but have no choice.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If gravity wins, they will become a black hole.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If they win, they become a neutron star.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city,

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but holding the mass of our sun.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And here, things get weird.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms,

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
are made up of smaller particles called quarks.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Quarks really don't want to be alone.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They are what we call confined.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can try to separate them, but the harder you pull,

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the harder they try to pull themselves back together.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you use a lot of energy, they just use a lot of energy.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They just use this energy to create new quarks.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and have never been observed by themselves.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The up and down quarks found in protons and neutrons.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All other quarks seem to decay away quickly.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But this may be different inside neutron stars.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The forces operating in their cores are so extreme

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Neutron star cores are like fossils,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
One hypothesis is that inside a neutron star core,

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
protons and neutrons de-confine.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All the particles crammed shoulder to shoulder

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
made purely from quarks.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Quark matter.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A star made from this is called a quark star,

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
though from the outside it may not look any different than a regular neutron star.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it may get stranger.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Literally.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In the cores of neutron stars,

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
some of the quarks may be converted into strange quarks.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If they turn up, they could create strange matter.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
More stable than any other matter in the universe.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If this is the case, we have a problem.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It might be infectious.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that it would immediately turn it into strange matter too.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath,

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which frees energy and creates more strange matter.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But then again, who cares?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All of it is inside neutron stars.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars, or black holes,

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
they spew out tremendous amounts of their insides,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They could be really small, maybe even subatomic,

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but even the largest strangelets wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
until they meet a star or planet by chance.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If one were to strike Earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The more it converts, the more it would grow.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ultimately, all of the atoms making up Earth would be converted.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter the size of an asteroid.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If a strangelet strikes the Sun, it would collapse into a strange star,

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
eating through it like fire through a dry forest.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This would not change the Sun's mass much,

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but it would become way less bright, so Earth would freeze to death.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And like a tiny virus, we'd have no way to see a strangelet coming.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common,

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
outnumbering all stars in the galaxy.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
These strangelets could have formed very early after the Big Bang,

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
as the universe expanded and evolved.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But then again, maybe not.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is speculation, and the Earth and Sun and planets

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
haven't been consumed in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years,

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
so the odds seem good that it won't happen anytime soon.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Understanding these strange objects today

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and why it grew to look the way it does now.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and thinking about electrons,

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The scientists thinking about the cores of neutron stars and strange matter today

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Or maybe not. Time will tell.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So while you're waiting to see if the universe gets destroyed,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you might still want to find out more about it.

119
