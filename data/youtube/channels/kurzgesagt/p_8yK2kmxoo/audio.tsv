0	5000	Neutron stars are the densest things that are not black holes.
5000	10000	In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence.
10000	12000	Strange matter.
12000	16000	A bizarre thing so extreme that it bends the rules of the universe
16000	21000	and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with.
21000	24000	Or it could teach us about how the universe began.
24000	26000	Maybe both.
30000	39000	To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics.
39000	44000	What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe?
44000	48000	To get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things,
48000	52000	but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details.
52000	58000	A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova.
58000	62000	When this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity
62000	68000	with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently.
68000	73000	Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons.
73000	77000	All the nothing inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles
77000	81000	that really don't want to be close to each other, but have no choice.
81000	85000	They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse.
85000	88000	If gravity wins, they will become a black hole.
88000	91000	If they win, they become a neutron star.
91000	96000	This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city,
96000	98000	but holding the mass of our sun.
98000	101000	And here, things get weird.
101000	107000	The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change.
107000	112000	And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance.
112000	115000	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
115000	119000	We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken.
119000	122000	Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms,
122000	126000	are made up of smaller particles called quarks.
126000	128000	Quarks really don't want to be alone.
128000	131000	They are what we call confined.
131000	134000	You can try to separate them, but the harder you pull,
134000	137000	the harder they try to pull themselves back together.
137000	141000	If you use a lot of energy, they just use a lot of energy.
141000	144000	They just use this energy to create new quarks.
144000	148000	Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles
148000	151000	and have never been observed by themselves.
151000	155000	They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter.
155000	159000	The up and down quarks found in protons and neutrons.
159000	162000	All other quarks seem to decay away quickly.
162000	166000	But this may be different inside neutron stars.
166000	169000	The forces operating in their cores are so extreme
169000	174000	that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang.
174000	176000	Neutron star cores are like fossils,
176000	180000	which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything.
180000	183000	So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star
183000	188000	is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself.
188000	191000	One hypothesis is that inside a neutron star core,
191000	194000	protons and neutrons de-confine.
194000	196000	All the particles crammed shoulder to shoulder
196000	200000	dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks.
200000	204000	Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing
204000	206000	made purely from quarks.
206000	208000	Quark matter.
208000	211000	A star made from this is called a quark star,
211000	216000	though from the outside it may not look any different than a regular neutron star.
216000	220000	Now we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance.
220000	222000	If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough,
222000	225000	it may get stranger.
225000	227000	Literally.
227000	228000	In the cores of neutron stars,
228000	232000	some of the quarks may be converted into strange quarks.
232000	235000	Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties,
235000	239000	and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger.
239000	243000	If they turn up, they could create strange matter.
243000	246000	Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter.
246000	250000	Perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible.
250000	253000	More stable than any other matter in the universe.
253000	257000	So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars.
257000	260000	If this is the case, we have a problem.
260000	262000	It might be infectious.
262000	266000	Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability
266000	270000	that it would immediately turn it into strange matter too.
270000	274000	Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath,
274000	278000	which frees energy and creates more strange matter.
278000	282000	The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole.
282000	284000	But then again, who cares?
284000	287000	All of it is inside neutron stars.
287000	292000	Except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars, or black holes,
292000	295000	they spew out tremendous amounts of their insides,
295000	300000	some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets.
300000	304000	Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star.
304000	307000	They could be really small, maybe even subatomic,
307000	311000	but even the largest strangelets wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket.
311000	315000	These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years
315000	318000	until they meet a star or planet by chance.
318000	323000	If one were to strike Earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter.
323000	326000	The more it converts, the more it would grow.
326000	330000	Ultimately, all of the atoms making up Earth would be converted.
330000	335000	Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter the size of an asteroid.
335000	340000	If a strangelet strikes the Sun, it would collapse into a strange star,
340000	343000	eating through it like fire through a dry forest.
343000	346000	This would not change the Sun's mass much,
346000	350000	but it would become way less bright, so Earth would freeze to death.
350000	354000	And like a tiny virus, we'd have no way to see a strangelet coming.
354000	359000	Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common,
359000	362000	outnumbering all stars in the galaxy.
362000	365000	These strangelets could have formed very early after the Big Bang,
365000	369000	when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere.
369000	372000	They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies
372000	375000	as the universe expanded and evolved.
375000	378000	Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive
378000	383000	that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together.
383000	385000	But then again, maybe not.
385000	389000	This is speculation, and the Earth and Sun and planets
389000	393000	haven't been consumed in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years,
393000	396000	so the odds seem good that it won't happen anytime soon.
397000	400000	Understanding these strange objects today
400000	403000	may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe
403000	406000	and why it grew to look the way it does now.
406000	410000	When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires
410000	412000	and thinking about electrons,
412000	416000	they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years.
416000	420000	The scientists thinking about the cores of neutron stars and strange matter today
420000	425000	may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations.
425000	428000	Or maybe not. Time will tell.
