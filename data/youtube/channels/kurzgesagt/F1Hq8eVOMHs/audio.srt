1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,840
enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It's an expression of

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,820
culture our parents love and a means of celebration or comfort. That's why it

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,320
hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,780
fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,740
press. It doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,860
yourself and that debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,760
an answer. The reality is, well, it's complicated. Let's take a look at three

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,260
climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what happens.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,280
One. Does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change? Feeding

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,240
billions of people is impossible without causing emissions. Even if someday we

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,800
have zero carbon tractors, refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,120
and electric trucks to move our food, there are still unavoidable emissions.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,800
Rice emits methane. We cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops. And

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,040
we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure. Worldwide food

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
production is responsible for about 26% of all human made greenhouse gas

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,520
emissions, which is unfortunate since food is not optional. While 26% doesn't

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
sound that bad, it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
emissions today, the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,920
carbon budget by 2100. So no matter how we twist and turn it, food is a real

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,760
driver of climate change. Still, emissions from different food items vary a lot.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,760
How do things look when we compare their footprints separately? Food's climate

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,840
impact is most often based on life cycle assessments, an analysis that looks at

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,400
all the emissions of a product throughout its existence, from production

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,080
to transportation, packaging, use and waste management. In the most detailed

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,760
meta-analysis of life cycle assessments to date, beef emissions stand out at

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,960
the top. On average, a kilogram of beef emits 71 kilograms of co2 equivalents.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Lamb is also high at 40 kilograms. Pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kilograms. At the

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,520
bottom we have lots of plant-based foods. Potatoes, for example, emit around 150

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,120
times less than beef. The most important aspect of food isn't weight though, it's

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,000
nutrient density. A kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,440
kilogram of potatoes. So how does the ranking change if we compare emissions

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,600
per calorie or protein? Not much. Animal protein is still the most costly for the

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,800
environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie. But is

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,160
this fair? After all, not all beef is the same. There are all sorts of ways to rear

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,920
cattle from pure grass-fed to factory farming. The worst beef comes in at 105

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,720
kilograms of emissions per 100 grams of protein, the best at only nine. A

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,480
tenfold difference. In contrast, most other foods, especially plant-based, have

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,040
a much narrower spectrum. Still, the best beef is worse than the worst plant. Okay,

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,600
but this seems promising. Can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions? Maybe

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,520
by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint? Two, does buying

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,200
local food actually matter? Let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier. By

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,000
buying locally, you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,640
packaging. But it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,640
emissions. Actually, transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,200
all food emissions. Nearly all food transport emissions are produced over

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,960
the last few miles, the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,720
shops in your area. International food transport happens mostly on freight

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,320
ships, which are insanely efficient. For example, shipping one kilogram of

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,560
avocados from South America to Europe generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,040
equivalents in transport emissions and around 2.5 kilograms overall, while one

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,880
kilogram of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kilograms in CO2

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,840
equivalents at least. So even when shipped great distances, emissions from

54
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,320
almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,760
products. Okay, so if transport doesn't play a big role, what causes the vast

56
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,760
amounts of emissions from beef then? By far the largest share of beef emissions

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,000
consists of methane released directly by the animals. While CO2 hangs around for

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,680
centuries, methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades. But in these

59
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,800
short periods, it is very powerful. All in all, methane has already caused 23 to 40

60
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,680
percent of human-made warming so far. There's controversy about how bad this

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,760
is exactly, and we don't want to dive in too deep here, but the way things stand,

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,960
any kinds of extra emissions are not great. Still, all cows burp and fart to

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,560
similar degrees. What explains the spectrum of beef emissions? There are a

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,680
couple of things. It makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or

65
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,640
one dedicated to beef production. 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,680
sharing its footprint with dairy products. Dairy cows tend to get

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,760
higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane.

68
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,680
possible. The worst factor by far is the destruction of forests for farmland. Not

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,880
only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the flora, it sets free carbon

71
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,080
that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future.

72
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,160
This aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef. The worst

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,200
emitters are farms burning down rainforest for farmland, especially in

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,080
Brazil. There is a sinister truth hidden here. The more animals suffer, the better

75
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,240
they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient. They

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,360
use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,000
and don't expend energy on things like walking. Cattle in a factory farm that

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,880
never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than

79
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,480
cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly lush piece of rainforest. But isn't it a

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,320
bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much? Some of the land

81
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,160
these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops anyway. By grazing on

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,480
pastures, they can turn things we can't digest into food. Isn't farming animals

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,400
just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources? Three. Don't cows mainly

84
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,800
use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things? About half

85
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,840
of the world's ice and desert-free land is used for agriculture, an area the

86
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,160
size of the entire Americas plus China. Half of all agriculturally used land is

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,560
dedicated to animals. Most of it is grassland, 65% of which cannot be

88
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,800
converted to cropland. So pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way

89
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,280
to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway. There are a

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,520
couple of catches here though. While the idea of cows turning useless grass into

91
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,160
steak is nice, it is part of a marketing lie. Even though it is so massive,

92
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,200
pastureland alone can't support the ruminants living on it. Globally, grazing

93
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,400
systems sustain only 13% of beef production. So if we were to switch to

94
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,680
100% grass-fed, we'd simply have to eat much less beef. In the US, beef

95
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,240
production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass. The

96
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,200
only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,240
them to our cattle. And we haven't even talked about chicken and pigs, which

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
exclusively eat feed crops. Because of this feed demand, less than half of the

99
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,400
world's cereals are used directly as human food. 41% is fed to animals. The

100
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,320
same is true for soy. There's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy

101
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,400
production, which makes us think of soy milk and tofu. But only 19% of global soy

102
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,880
production goes towards products for humans. About 77% is used to feed animals.

103
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,800
Besides, land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless. A

104
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,680
beef-free diet would free up around 2 billion hectares, a vegan diet would free

105
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,360
up around 3 billion hectares of land. We could use this land to grow forests or

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
restore wild grasslands, basically anything that could suck carbon out of

107
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
the atmosphere. If we spent 3 billion hectares of land, it could remove about

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,080
8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year. By comparison, we emit about 50

109
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,120
billion tons of CO2 equivalents per year at the moment. That means we could save

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,320
16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet. Okay, to summarize, food is a huge driver

111
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,640
of emissions. Meat, but especially beef, is the worst food in terms of emissions.

112
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,120
Buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the

113
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,760
type of food you're consuming. When it comes to beef, cattle that are grass-fed

114
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,960
can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land.

115
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,620
Even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the

116
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,720
world, your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint

117
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,200
than a veggie patty. You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this

118
