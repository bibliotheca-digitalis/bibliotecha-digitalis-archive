0	5100	Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is
5100	9840	enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It's an expression of
9840	15820	culture our parents love and a means of celebration or comfort. That's why it
15820	19320	hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to
19320	24780	fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst
24780	28740	press. It doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research
28780	33860	yourself and that debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us
33860	39760	an answer. The reality is, well, it's complicated. Let's take a look at three
39760	45260	climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what happens.
51660	58280	One. Does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change? Feeding
58320	63240	billions of people is impossible without causing emissions. Even if someday we
63240	67800	have zero carbon tractors, refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy
67800	72120	and electric trucks to move our food, there are still unavoidable emissions.
72120	77800	Rice emits methane. We cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops. And
77800	84040	we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure. Worldwide food
84080	88640	production is responsible for about 26% of all human made greenhouse gas
88640	95520	emissions, which is unfortunate since food is not optional. While 26% doesn't
95520	99520	sound that bad, it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of
99520	103920	emissions today, the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire
103920	110920	carbon budget by 2100. So no matter how we twist and turn it, food is a real
110960	116760	driver of climate change. Still, emissions from different food items vary a lot.
116760	121760	How do things look when we compare their footprints separately? Food's climate
121760	126840	impact is most often based on life cycle assessments, an analysis that looks at
126840	130400	all the emissions of a product throughout its existence, from production
130400	136080	to transportation, packaging, use and waste management. In the most detailed
136080	140760	meta-analysis of life cycle assessments to date, beef emissions stand out at
140760	146960	the top. On average, a kilogram of beef emits 71 kilograms of co2 equivalents.
146960	154560	Lamb is also high at 40 kilograms. Pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kilograms. At the
154560	160520	bottom we have lots of plant-based foods. Potatoes, for example, emit around 150
160520	166120	times less than beef. The most important aspect of food isn't weight though, it's
166280	171000	nutrient density. A kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a
171000	175440	kilogram of potatoes. So how does the ranking change if we compare emissions
175440	181600	per calorie or protein? Not much. Animal protein is still the most costly for the
181600	187800	environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie. But is
187800	193160	this fair? After all, not all beef is the same. There are all sorts of ways to rear
193160	198920	cattle from pure grass-fed to factory farming. The worst beef comes in at 105
198920	203720	kilograms of emissions per 100 grams of protein, the best at only nine. A
203720	209480	tenfold difference. In contrast, most other foods, especially plant-based, have
209480	216040	a much narrower spectrum. Still, the best beef is worse than the worst plant. Okay,
216040	221600	but this seems promising. Can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions? Maybe
221720	227520	by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint? Two, does buying
227520	234200	local food actually matter? Let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier. By
234200	238000	buying locally, you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and
238000	243640	packaging. But it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total
243640	248640	emissions. Actually, transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of
248680	253200	all food emissions. Nearly all food transport emissions are produced over
253200	256960	the last few miles, the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and
256960	261720	shops in your area. International food transport happens mostly on freight
261720	266320	ships, which are insanely efficient. For example, shipping one kilogram of
266320	271560	avocados from South America to Europe generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2
271560	277040	equivalents in transport emissions and around 2.5 kilograms overall, while one
277040	281880	kilogram of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kilograms in CO2
281880	286840	equivalents at least. So even when shipped great distances, emissions from
286840	291320	almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal
291320	296760	products. Okay, so if transport doesn't play a big role, what causes the vast
296760	301760	amounts of emissions from beef then? By far the largest share of beef emissions
301800	308000	consists of methane released directly by the animals. While CO2 hangs around for
308000	312680	centuries, methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades. But in these
312680	319800	short periods, it is very powerful. All in all, methane has already caused 23 to 40
319800	324680	percent of human-made warming so far. There's controversy about how bad this
324680	328760	is exactly, and we don't want to dive in too deep here, but the way things stand,
329000	334960	any kinds of extra emissions are not great. Still, all cows burp and fart to
334960	339560	similar degrees. What explains the spectrum of beef emissions? There are a
339560	343680	couple of things. It makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or
343680	349640	one dedicated to beef production. 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows
349640	353680	sharing its footprint with dairy products. Dairy cows tend to get
353680	357760	higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane.
357760	361760	Geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are
361760	367680	possible. The worst factor by far is the destruction of forests for farmland. Not
367680	371880	only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the flora, it sets free carbon
371880	376080	that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future.
376080	381160	This aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef. The worst
381160	385200	emitters are farms burning down rainforest for farmland, especially in
385200	391080	Brazil. There is a sinister truth hidden here. The more animals suffer, the better
391080	395240	they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient. They
395240	399360	use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster
399360	405000	and don't expend energy on things like walking. Cattle in a factory farm that
405000	409880	never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than
409880	415480	cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly lush piece of rainforest. But isn't it a
415480	420320	bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much? Some of the land
420320	425160	these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops anyway. By grazing on
425160	430480	pastures, they can turn things we can't digest into food. Isn't farming animals
430480	437400	just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources? Three. Don't cows mainly
437400	442800	use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things? About half
442800	446840	of the world's ice and desert-free land is used for agriculture, an area the
446840	452160	size of the entire Americas plus China. Half of all agriculturally used land is
452160	457560	dedicated to animals. Most of it is grassland, 65% of which cannot be
457560	461800	converted to cropland. So pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way
461800	466280	to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway. There are a
466360	471520	couple of catches here though. While the idea of cows turning useless grass into
471520	477160	steak is nice, it is part of a marketing lie. Even though it is so massive,
477160	482200	pastureland alone can't support the ruminants living on it. Globally, grazing
482200	487400	systems sustain only 13% of beef production. So if we were to switch to
487400	493680	100% grass-fed, we'd simply have to eat much less beef. In the US, beef
493720	500240	production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass. The
500240	505200	only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding
505200	510240	them to our cattle. And we haven't even talked about chicken and pigs, which
510240	516080	exclusively eat feed crops. Because of this feed demand, less than half of the
516080	522400	world's cereals are used directly as human food. 41% is fed to animals. The
522440	527320	same is true for soy. There's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy
527320	533400	production, which makes us think of soy milk and tofu. But only 19% of global soy
533400	539880	production goes towards products for humans. About 77% is used to feed animals.
539880	544800	Besides, land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless. A
544800	549680	beef-free diet would free up around 2 billion hectares, a vegan diet would free
549720	555360	up around 3 billion hectares of land. We could use this land to grow forests or
555360	559600	restore wild grasslands, basically anything that could suck carbon out of
559600	564000	the atmosphere. If we spent 3 billion hectares of land, it could remove about
564000	569080	8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year. By comparison, we emit about 50
569080	573120	billion tons of CO2 equivalents per year at the moment. That means we could save
573160	580320	16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet. Okay, to summarize, food is a huge driver
580320	585640	of emissions. Meat, but especially beef, is the worst food in terms of emissions.
585640	590120	Buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the
590120	594760	type of food you're consuming. When it comes to beef, cattle that are grass-fed
594760	598960	can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land.
598960	602620	Even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the
602620	606720	world, your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint
606720	611200	than a veggie patty. You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this
611200	618280	information. In fact, you are always only one decision away from making a change.
