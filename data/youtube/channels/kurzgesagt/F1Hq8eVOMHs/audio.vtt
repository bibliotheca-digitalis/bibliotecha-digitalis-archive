00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is

00:05.100 --> 00:09.840
enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. It's an expression of

00:09.840 --> 00:15.820
culture our parents love and a means of celebration or comfort. That's why it

00:15.820 --> 00:19.320
hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to

00:19.320 --> 00:24.780
fight rapid climate change. One of the most delicious foods, meat, gets the worst

00:24.780 --> 00:28.740
press. It doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research

00:28.780 --> 00:33.860
yourself and that debates get emotional quickly. But clearly science can give us

00:33.860 --> 00:39.760
an answer. The reality is, well, it's complicated. Let's take a look at three

00:39.760 --> 00:45.260
climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what happens.

00:51.660 --> 00:58.280
One. Does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change? Feeding

00:58.320 --> 01:03.240
billions of people is impossible without causing emissions. Even if someday we

01:03.240 --> 01:07.800
have zero carbon tractors, refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy

01:07.800 --> 01:12.120
and electric trucks to move our food, there are still unavoidable emissions.

01:12.120 --> 01:17.800
Rice emits methane. We cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops. And

01:17.800 --> 01:24.040
we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure. Worldwide food

01:24.080 --> 01:28.640
production is responsible for about 26% of all human made greenhouse gas

01:28.640 --> 01:35.520
emissions, which is unfortunate since food is not optional. While 26% doesn't

01:35.520 --> 01:39.520
sound that bad, it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of

01:39.520 --> 01:43.920
emissions today, the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire

01:43.920 --> 01:50.920
carbon budget by 2100. So no matter how we twist and turn it, food is a real

01:50.960 --> 01:56.760
driver of climate change. Still, emissions from different food items vary a lot.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.760
How do things look when we compare their footprints separately? Food's climate

02:01.760 --> 02:06.840
impact is most often based on life cycle assessments, an analysis that looks at

02:06.840 --> 02:10.400
all the emissions of a product throughout its existence, from production

02:10.400 --> 02:16.080
to transportation, packaging, use and waste management. In the most detailed

02:16.080 --> 02:20.760
meta-analysis of life cycle assessments to date, beef emissions stand out at

02:20.760 --> 02:26.960
the top. On average, a kilogram of beef emits 71 kilograms of co2 equivalents.

02:26.960 --> 02:34.560
Lamb is also high at 40 kilograms. Pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kilograms. At the

02:34.560 --> 02:40.520
bottom we have lots of plant-based foods. Potatoes, for example, emit around 150

02:40.520 --> 02:46.120
times less than beef. The most important aspect of food isn't weight though, it's

02:46.280 --> 02:51.000
nutrient density. A kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a

02:51.000 --> 02:55.440
kilogram of potatoes. So how does the ranking change if we compare emissions

02:55.440 --> 03:01.600
per calorie or protein? Not much. Animal protein is still the most costly for the

03:01.600 --> 03:07.800
environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie. But is

03:07.800 --> 03:13.160
this fair? After all, not all beef is the same. There are all sorts of ways to rear

03:13.160 --> 03:18.920
cattle from pure grass-fed to factory farming. The worst beef comes in at 105

03:18.920 --> 03:23.720
kilograms of emissions per 100 grams of protein, the best at only nine. A

03:23.720 --> 03:29.480
tenfold difference. In contrast, most other foods, especially plant-based, have

03:29.480 --> 03:36.040
a much narrower spectrum. Still, the best beef is worse than the worst plant. Okay,

03:36.040 --> 03:41.600
but this seems promising. Can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions? Maybe

03:41.720 --> 03:47.520
by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint? Two, does buying

03:47.520 --> 03:54.200
local food actually matter? Let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier. By

03:54.200 --> 03:58.000
buying locally, you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and

03:58.000 --> 04:03.640
packaging. But it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total

04:03.640 --> 04:08.640
emissions. Actually, transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of

04:08.680 --> 04:13.200
all food emissions. Nearly all food transport emissions are produced over

04:13.200 --> 04:16.960
the last few miles, the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and

04:16.960 --> 04:21.720
shops in your area. International food transport happens mostly on freight

04:21.720 --> 04:26.320
ships, which are insanely efficient. For example, shipping one kilogram of

04:26.320 --> 04:31.560
avocados from South America to Europe generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2

04:31.560 --> 04:37.040
equivalents in transport emissions and around 2.5 kilograms overall, while one

04:37.040 --> 04:41.880
kilogram of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kilograms in CO2

04:41.880 --> 04:46.840
equivalents at least. So even when shipped great distances, emissions from

04:46.840 --> 04:51.320
almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal

04:51.320 --> 04:56.760
products. Okay, so if transport doesn't play a big role, what causes the vast

04:56.760 --> 05:01.760
amounts of emissions from beef then? By far the largest share of beef emissions

05:01.800 --> 05:08.000
consists of methane released directly by the animals. While CO2 hangs around for

05:08.000 --> 05:12.680
centuries, methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades. But in these

05:12.680 --> 05:19.800
short periods, it is very powerful. All in all, methane has already caused 23 to 40

05:19.800 --> 05:24.680
percent of human-made warming so far. There's controversy about how bad this

05:24.680 --> 05:28.760
is exactly, and we don't want to dive in too deep here, but the way things stand,

05:29.000 --> 05:34.960
any kinds of extra emissions are not great. Still, all cows burp and fart to

05:34.960 --> 05:39.560
similar degrees. What explains the spectrum of beef emissions? There are a

05:39.560 --> 05:43.680
couple of things. It makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or

05:43.680 --> 05:49.640
one dedicated to beef production. 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows

05:49.640 --> 05:53.680
sharing its footprint with dairy products. Dairy cows tend to get

05:53.680 --> 05:57.760
higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.760
Geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are

06:01.760 --> 06:07.680
possible. The worst factor by far is the destruction of forests for farmland. Not

06:07.680 --> 06:11.880
only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the flora, it sets free carbon

06:11.880 --> 06:16.080
that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.160
This aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef. The worst

06:21.160 --> 06:25.200
emitters are farms burning down rainforest for farmland, especially in

06:25.200 --> 06:31.080
Brazil. There is a sinister truth hidden here. The more animals suffer, the better

06:31.080 --> 06:35.240
they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient. They

06:35.240 --> 06:39.360
use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster

06:39.360 --> 06:45.000
and don't expend energy on things like walking. Cattle in a factory farm that

06:45.000 --> 06:49.880
never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than

06:49.880 --> 06:55.480
cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly lush piece of rainforest. But isn't it a

06:55.480 --> 07:00.320
bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much? Some of the land

07:00.320 --> 07:05.160
these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops anyway. By grazing on

07:05.160 --> 07:10.480
pastures, they can turn things we can't digest into food. Isn't farming animals

07:10.480 --> 07:17.400
just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources? Three. Don't cows mainly

07:17.400 --> 07:22.800
use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things? About half

07:22.800 --> 07:26.840
of the world's ice and desert-free land is used for agriculture, an area the

07:26.840 --> 07:32.160
size of the entire Americas plus China. Half of all agriculturally used land is

07:32.160 --> 07:37.560
dedicated to animals. Most of it is grassland, 65% of which cannot be

07:37.560 --> 07:41.800
converted to cropland. So pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way

07:41.800 --> 07:46.280
to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway. There are a

07:46.360 --> 07:51.520
couple of catches here though. While the idea of cows turning useless grass into

07:51.520 --> 07:57.160
steak is nice, it is part of a marketing lie. Even though it is so massive,

07:57.160 --> 08:02.200
pastureland alone can't support the ruminants living on it. Globally, grazing

08:02.200 --> 08:07.400
systems sustain only 13% of beef production. So if we were to switch to

08:07.400 --> 08:13.680
100% grass-fed, we'd simply have to eat much less beef. In the US, beef

08:13.720 --> 08:20.240
production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass. The

08:20.240 --> 08:25.200
only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding

08:25.200 --> 08:30.240
them to our cattle. And we haven't even talked about chicken and pigs, which

08:30.240 --> 08:36.080
exclusively eat feed crops. Because of this feed demand, less than half of the

08:36.080 --> 08:42.400
world's cereals are used directly as human food. 41% is fed to animals. The

08:42.440 --> 08:47.320
same is true for soy. There's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy

08:47.320 --> 08:53.400
production, which makes us think of soy milk and tofu. But only 19% of global soy

08:53.400 --> 08:59.880
production goes towards products for humans. About 77% is used to feed animals.

08:59.880 --> 09:04.800
Besides, land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless. A

09:04.800 --> 09:09.680
beef-free diet would free up around 2 billion hectares, a vegan diet would free

09:09.720 --> 09:15.360
up around 3 billion hectares of land. We could use this land to grow forests or

09:15.360 --> 09:19.600
restore wild grasslands, basically anything that could suck carbon out of

09:19.600 --> 09:24.000
the atmosphere. If we spent 3 billion hectares of land, it could remove about

09:24.000 --> 09:29.080
8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year. By comparison, we emit about 50

09:29.080 --> 09:33.120
billion tons of CO2 equivalents per year at the moment. That means we could save

09:33.160 --> 09:40.320
16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet. Okay, to summarize, food is a huge driver

09:40.320 --> 09:45.640
of emissions. Meat, but especially beef, is the worst food in terms of emissions.

09:45.640 --> 09:50.120
Buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the

09:50.120 --> 09:54.760
type of food you're consuming. When it comes to beef, cattle that are grass-fed

09:54.760 --> 09:58.960
can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.620
Even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the

10:02.620 --> 10:06.720
world, your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint

10:06.720 --> 10:11.200
than a veggie patty. You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this

10:11.200 --> 10:18.280
