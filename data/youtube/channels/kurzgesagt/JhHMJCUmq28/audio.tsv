0	6400	For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.
6400	13000	While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.
13000	22000	Since the 1960s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.
22000	25800	But this process is about to meet its physical limits.
25800	29000	Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.
29000	33000	To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.
40000	49000	A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things, representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.
49000	54000	Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.
54000	64000	A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through.
64000	69000	This information is made up of bits, which can be set to either 0 or 1.
69000	73000	Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.
73000	78000	Transistors are combined to create logic gates, which still do very simple stuff.
78000	85000	For example, an AND gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.
85000	91000	Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say for adding two numbers.
91000	97000	Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.
97000	106000	Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first-grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.
106000	111000	A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.
111000	116000	However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky.
116000	120000	In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.
120000	128000	Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another, so a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.
128000	139000	Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nm, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell's.
139000	148000	As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called quantum tunneling.
148000	157000	In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense.
157000	161000	We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.
161000	169000	To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.
169000	173000	In normal computers, bits are the smallest units of information.
173000	178000	Quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values.
178000	184000	A qubit can be any two-level quantum system, such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon.
184000	191000	0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photon's horizontal or vertical polarization.
191000	198000	In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once.
198000	200000	This is called superposition.
200000	209000	But as soon as you test its value, say by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.
209000	217000	So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predict which it will be.
217000	222000	But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.
222000	225000	Superposition is a game-changer.
225000	230000	Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.
230000	235000	That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.
235000	241000	Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once.
241000	244000	This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.
244000	248000	20 of them can already store a million values in parallel.
248000	253000	A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement,
253000	260000	a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart.
260000	268000	This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look.
268000	271000	Qubit manipulation is a mind-bender as well.
271000	276000	A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.
276000	285000	A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output.
285000	291000	So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,
291000	298000	and finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones.
298000	304000	What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time.
304000	312000	Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results, and it will only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double-check and try again.
312000	321000	But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.
321000	328000	So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in some areas they are vastly superior.
328000	330000	One of them is database searching.
330000	335000	To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.
336000	342000	Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases is a huge difference.
342000	347000	The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.
347000	357000	Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.
357000	362000	The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.
362000	368000	Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.
368000	372000	But a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.
372000	375000	Another really exciting new use is simulations.
375000	384000	Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.
384000	388000	So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?
389000	394000	Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.
394000	401000	Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity.
401000	406000	We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
