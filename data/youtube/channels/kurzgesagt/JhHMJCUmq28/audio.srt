00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,000
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Since the 1960s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,800
But this process is about to meet its physical limits.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,000
Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things, representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This information is made up of bits, which can be set to either 0 or 1.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Transistors are combined to create logic gates, which still do very simple stuff.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For example, an AND gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say for adding two numbers.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first-grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another, so a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nm, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell's.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called quantum tunneling.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In normal computers, bits are the smallest units of information.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A qubit can be any two-level quantum system, such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photon's horizontal or vertical polarization.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is called superposition.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But as soon as you test its value, say by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predict which it will be.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Superposition is a game-changer.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
20 of them can already store a million values in parallel.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement,

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Qubit manipulation is a mind-bender as well.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results, and it will only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double-check and try again.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in some areas they are vastly superior.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
One of them is database searching.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases is a huge difference.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Another really exciting new use is simulations.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
