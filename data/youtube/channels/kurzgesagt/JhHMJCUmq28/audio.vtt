00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.

00:06.400 --> 00:13.000
While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains.

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
Since the 1960s, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.800
But this process is about to meet its physical limits.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.000
Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things, representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors.

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block or open the way for information coming through.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
This information is made up of bits, which can be set to either 0 or 1.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Transistors are combined to create logic gates, which still do very simple stuff.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
For example, an AND gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say for adding two numbers.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first-grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another, so a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.

02:08.000 --> 02:19.000
Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nm, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell's.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called quantum tunneling.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
In normal computers, bits are the smallest units of information.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
A qubit can be any two-level quantum system, such as a spin in a magnetic field or a single photon.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photon's horizontal or vertical polarization.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be in just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
This is called superposition.

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
But as soon as you test its value, say by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predict which it will be.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Superposition is a game-changer.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
20 of them can already store a million values in parallel.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is entanglement,

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
This means that when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of its partners without having to look.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Qubit manipulation is a mind-bender as well.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
and finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of zeros and ones.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup all done at the same time.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results, and it will only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double-check and try again.

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
So while quantum computers will probably not replace our home computers, in some areas they are vastly superior.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
One of them is database searching.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Quantum algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases is a huge difference.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
But a quantum computer with exponential speedup could do it in a breeze.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Another really exciting new use is simulations.

06:15.000 --> 06:24.000
Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures such as molecules, they often lack accuracy.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics?

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a very specialized tool or a big revolution for humanity.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
