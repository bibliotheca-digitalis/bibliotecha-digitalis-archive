1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Life is fundamentally different from dead stuff.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,240
Or is it?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,920
Physicist Erwin Schrodinger defined life this way.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,400
Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,480
What does this mean?

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's pretend that your download folder is the universe.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,840
By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
This is what living things do.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,520
But what is life?

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680
Every living thing on this planet is made of cells.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,520
Basically, a cell is a protein-based robot too small to feel or experience anything.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,240
It has the properties we just assigned to life.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,600
It has a wall that separates it from the surroundings, creating order.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,080
It regulates itself and maintains a constant state.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,400
It eats stuff to stay alive.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,160
It grows and develops.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,080
It reacts to the environment.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,560
And it's subject to evolution.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,160
And it makes more of itself.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,400
But of all the stuff that makes up a cell, no part is alive.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff,

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
forming reactions that start other reactions which start other reactions.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,360
In a single cell every second, several million chemical reactions take place,

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
forming a complex orchestra.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,560
A cell can build several thousand types of protein,

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,760
some very simple, some complex micro-machines.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
Imagine driving a car at 100 kilometers an hour

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,480
while constantly rebuilding every single part of it

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,080
with stuff you collect from the street.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
That is what cells do.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
But no part of the cell is alive.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
Everything is dead matter moved by the laws of the universe.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
So is life the aggregate of all these reaction processes that are taking place?

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
Eventually every living thing will die.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,120
The goal of the whole process is to prevent this by producing new entities.

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,280
And by this we mean DNA.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
Life is, in a way, just a lot of stuff that carries genetic information around.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
Every living thing is subject to evolution

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,360
and the DNA that develops the best living thing around it will stay in the game.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
So is DNA life then?

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
If you take DNA out of its hull, it certainly is a very complex molecule,

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
but it can't do anything by itself.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,520
This is where viruses make everything more complicated.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,080
They are basically strings of RNA or DNA in a small hull and need cells to do something.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,200
We're not sure if they count as living or dead.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,120
And still, there are 225 million cubic meters of viruses on Earth.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
They don't seem to care what we think of them.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
There are even viruses that invade dead cells and reanimate them

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
so they can be a host for them, which blurs the line even more.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,000
Or mitochondria.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,880
They are the power plants of most complex cells

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,480
and were previously free-living bacteria that entered a partnership with bigger cells.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
They still have their own DNA and can multiply on their own,

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
but they are not alive anymore.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,240
They are dead.

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,320
So they traded their own life for the survival of their DNA,

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,320
which means living things can evolve into dead things

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,800
as long as it's beneficial to their genetic code.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,120
So maybe life is information that manages to ensure its continued existence.

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
But what about AI?

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Artificial intelligence.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,120
By our most common definitions, we are very close to creating artificial life in computers.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
It's just a question of time before the technology we build gets there.

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
And this is not science fiction either.

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
There are a lot of smart people actively working on this.

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
You could already argue that computer viruses are alive.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
Okay, so what is life then?

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,720
Things.

70
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Processes.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,960
DNA.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Information.

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,360
This got confusing very fast.

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
One thing is for sure,

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,440
the idea that life is fundamentally different from non-living things

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,080
because they contain some non-physical element

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,880
or are governed by different principles than inanimate objects turns out to be wrong.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
Before Charles Darwin, humans drew a line between themselves and the rest of living things.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,640
There was something magical about us that made us special.

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Once we had to accept we are, like every living being, a product of evolution,

81
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
we drew a different line.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,680
But the more we learn about what computers can do and how life works,

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,160
the closer we get to creating the first machine that fits our description of life,

84
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,760
the more our image of ourselves is in danger again.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
And this will happen sooner or later.

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,160
And here's another question for you.

87
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,920
If everything in the universe is made of the same stuff,

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,800
does this mean everything in the universe is dead,

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,040
or that everything in the universe is alive?

90
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
That it's just a question of complexity.

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Does this mean we can never die because we were never alive in the first place?

92
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,640
Is life and death an irrelevant question and we haven't noticed it yet?

93
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,520
Is it possible we are much more part of the universe around us than we thought?

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,200
Don't look at us.

95
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,880
We don't have any answers for you, just questions for you to think about.

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
After all, it's thinking about questions like this that makes us feel alive

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
and gives us some comfort.
