0	3280	Life is fundamentally different from dead stuff.
3280	4240	Or is it?
4240	7920	Physicist Erwin Schrodinger defined life this way.
7920	12400	Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium.
12960	14480	What does this mean?
14480	17600	Let's pretend that your download folder is the universe.
17600	21600	It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.
21600	25840	By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.
25840	27920	This is what living things do.
27920	29520	But what is life?
36480	39680	Every living thing on this planet is made of cells.
39680	45520	Basically, a cell is a protein-based robot too small to feel or experience anything.
45520	48240	It has the properties we just assigned to life.
48240	51600	It has a wall that separates it from the surroundings, creating order.
52160	56080	It regulates itself and maintains a constant state.
56080	58400	It eats stuff to stay alive.
58400	60160	It grows and develops.
60160	62080	It reacts to the environment.
62080	64560	And it's subject to evolution.
64560	66160	And it makes more of itself.
66800	70400	But of all the stuff that makes up a cell, no part is alive.
71040	73920	Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff,
73920	77840	forming reactions that start other reactions which start other reactions.
78480	83360	In a single cell every second, several million chemical reactions take place,
83360	85040	forming a complex orchestra.
85600	88560	A cell can build several thousand types of protein,
88560	91760	some very simple, some complex micro-machines.
92560	95520	Imagine driving a car at 100 kilometers an hour
95520	98480	while constantly rebuilding every single part of it
98480	100080	with stuff you collect from the street.
100720	102320	That is what cells do.
103040	105360	But no part of the cell is alive.
105360	108720	Everything is dead matter moved by the laws of the universe.
109520	114240	So is life the aggregate of all these reaction processes that are taking place?
115200	117440	Eventually every living thing will die.
118160	123120	The goal of the whole process is to prevent this by producing new entities.
123120	125280	And by this we mean DNA.
125920	130560	Life is, in a way, just a lot of stuff that carries genetic information around.
130560	132880	Every living thing is subject to evolution
132880	137360	and the DNA that develops the best living thing around it will stay in the game.
138000	140160	So is DNA life then?
140800	145680	If you take DNA out of its hull, it certainly is a very complex molecule,
145680	147520	but it can't do anything by itself.
148240	151520	This is where viruses make everything more complicated.
152160	158080	They are basically strings of RNA or DNA in a small hull and need cells to do something.
158640	161200	We're not sure if they count as living or dead.
161760	167120	And still, there are 225 million cubic meters of viruses on Earth.
167120	169120	They don't seem to care what we think of them.
169680	173760	There are even viruses that invade dead cells and reanimate them
173760	177200	so they can be a host for them, which blurs the line even more.
178160	180000	Or mitochondria.
180000	182880	They are the power plants of most complex cells
182880	188480	and were previously free-living bacteria that entered a partnership with bigger cells.
188480	192400	They still have their own DNA and can multiply on their own,
192400	194400	but they are not alive anymore.
195120	196240	They are dead.
196800	200320	So they traded their own life for the survival of their DNA,
200880	204320	which means living things can evolve into dead things
204320	206800	as long as it's beneficial to their genetic code.
207520	213120	So maybe life is information that manages to ensure its continued existence.
213680	215760	But what about AI?
215760	216960	Artificial intelligence.
217600	223120	By our most common definitions, we are very close to creating artificial life in computers.
223680	227680	It's just a question of time before the technology we build gets there.
227680	229920	And this is not science fiction either.
229920	233280	There are a lot of smart people actively working on this.
233280	236000	You could already argue that computer viruses are alive.
237280	239680	Okay, so what is life then?
240320	240720	Things.
241280	242400	Processes.
242400	242960	DNA.
243600	244240	Information.
244960	247360	This got confusing very fast.
248080	249440	One thing is for sure,
249440	253440	the idea that life is fundamentally different from non-living things
253440	256080	because they contain some non-physical element
256080	260880	or are governed by different principles than inanimate objects turns out to be wrong.
261600	267360	Before Charles Darwin, humans drew a line between themselves and the rest of living things.
267360	270640	There was something magical about us that made us special.
271360	276240	Once we had to accept we are, like every living being, a product of evolution,
276240	277360	we drew a different line.
277920	281680	But the more we learn about what computers can do and how life works,
281680	286160	the closer we get to creating the first machine that fits our description of life,
286160	289760	the more our image of ourselves is in danger again.
289760	291760	And this will happen sooner or later.
292320	294160	And here's another question for you.
294720	297920	If everything in the universe is made of the same stuff,
297920	300800	does this mean everything in the universe is dead,
300800	303040	or that everything in the universe is alive?
303760	305920	That it's just a question of complexity.
306480	310320	Does this mean we can never die because we were never alive in the first place?
311040	314640	Is life and death an irrelevant question and we haven't noticed it yet?
315280	319520	Is it possible we are much more part of the universe around us than we thought?
320320	321200	Don't look at us.
321200	324880	We don't have any answers for you, just questions for you to think about.
325520	329920	After all, it's thinking about questions like this that makes us feel alive
329920	331920	and gives us some comfort.
