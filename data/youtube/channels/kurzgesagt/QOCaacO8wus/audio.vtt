00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Life is fundamentally different from dead stuff.

00:03.280 --> 00:04.240
Or is it?

00:04.240 --> 00:07.920
Physicist Erwin Schrodinger defined life this way.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.400
Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.480
What does this mean?

00:14.480 --> 00:17.600
Let's pretend that your download folder is the universe.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.600
It started orderly and got more and more chaotic over time.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.840
By investing energy, you can create order and clean it up.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.920
This is what living things do.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.520
But what is life?

00:36.480 --> 00:39.680
Every living thing on this planet is made of cells.

00:39.680 --> 00:45.520
Basically, a cell is a protein-based robot too small to feel or experience anything.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.240
It has the properties we just assigned to life.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.600
It has a wall that separates it from the surroundings, creating order.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.080
It regulates itself and maintains a constant state.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.400
It eats stuff to stay alive.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.160
It grows and develops.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.080
It reacts to the environment.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.560
And it's subject to evolution.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.160
And it makes more of itself.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.400
But of all the stuff that makes up a cell, no part is alive.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.920
Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff,

01:13.920 --> 01:17.840
forming reactions that start other reactions which start other reactions.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.360
In a single cell every second, several million chemical reactions take place,

01:23.360 --> 01:25.040
forming a complex orchestra.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.560
A cell can build several thousand types of protein,

01:28.560 --> 01:31.760
some very simple, some complex micro-machines.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.520
Imagine driving a car at 100 kilometers an hour

01:35.520 --> 01:38.480
while constantly rebuilding every single part of it

01:38.480 --> 01:40.080
with stuff you collect from the street.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.320
That is what cells do.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.360
But no part of the cell is alive.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.720
Everything is dead matter moved by the laws of the universe.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.240
So is life the aggregate of all these reaction processes that are taking place?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.440
Eventually every living thing will die.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.120
The goal of the whole process is to prevent this by producing new entities.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.280
And by this we mean DNA.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.560
Life is, in a way, just a lot of stuff that carries genetic information around.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.880
Every living thing is subject to evolution

02:12.880 --> 02:17.360
and the DNA that develops the best living thing around it will stay in the game.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.160
So is DNA life then?

02:20.800 --> 02:25.680
If you take DNA out of its hull, it certainly is a very complex molecule,

02:25.680 --> 02:27.520
but it can't do anything by itself.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.520
This is where viruses make everything more complicated.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.080
They are basically strings of RNA or DNA in a small hull and need cells to do something.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.200
We're not sure if they count as living or dead.

02:41.760 --> 02:47.120
And still, there are 225 million cubic meters of viruses on Earth.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.120
They don't seem to care what we think of them.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.760
There are even viruses that invade dead cells and reanimate them

02:53.760 --> 02:57.200
so they can be a host for them, which blurs the line even more.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.000
Or mitochondria.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.880
They are the power plants of most complex cells

03:02.880 --> 03:08.480
and were previously free-living bacteria that entered a partnership with bigger cells.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.400
They still have their own DNA and can multiply on their own,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
but they are not alive anymore.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.240
They are dead.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.320
So they traded their own life for the survival of their DNA,

03:20.880 --> 03:24.320
which means living things can evolve into dead things

03:24.320 --> 03:26.800
as long as it's beneficial to their genetic code.

03:27.520 --> 03:33.120
So maybe life is information that manages to ensure its continued existence.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.760
But what about AI?

03:35.760 --> 03:36.960
Artificial intelligence.

03:37.600 --> 03:43.120
By our most common definitions, we are very close to creating artificial life in computers.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.680
It's just a question of time before the technology we build gets there.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.920
And this is not science fiction either.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.280
There are a lot of smart people actively working on this.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.000
You could already argue that computer viruses are alive.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.680
Okay, so what is life then?

04:00.320 --> 04:00.720
Things.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.400
Processes.

04:02.400 --> 04:02.960
DNA.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.240
Information.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.360
This got confusing very fast.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.440
One thing is for sure,

04:09.440 --> 04:13.440
the idea that life is fundamentally different from non-living things

04:13.440 --> 04:16.080
because they contain some non-physical element

04:16.080 --> 04:20.880
or are governed by different principles than inanimate objects turns out to be wrong.

04:21.600 --> 04:27.360
Before Charles Darwin, humans drew a line between themselves and the rest of living things.

04:27.360 --> 04:30.640
There was something magical about us that made us special.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.240
Once we had to accept we are, like every living being, a product of evolution,

04:36.240 --> 04:37.360
we drew a different line.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.680
But the more we learn about what computers can do and how life works,

04:41.680 --> 04:46.160
the closer we get to creating the first machine that fits our description of life,

04:46.160 --> 04:49.760
the more our image of ourselves is in danger again.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.760
And this will happen sooner or later.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.160
And here's another question for you.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.920
If everything in the universe is made of the same stuff,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.800
does this mean everything in the universe is dead,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.040
or that everything in the universe is alive?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.920
That it's just a question of complexity.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.320
Does this mean we can never die because we were never alive in the first place?

05:11.040 --> 05:14.640
Is life and death an irrelevant question and we haven't noticed it yet?

05:15.280 --> 05:19.520
Is it possible we are much more part of the universe around us than we thought?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.200
Don't look at us.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.880
We don't have any answers for you, just questions for you to think about.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.920
After all, it's thinking about questions like this that makes us feel alive

05:29.920 --> 05:31.920
and gives us some comfort.
