0	6000	Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source.
6000	9000	Unfortunately, the universe will die.
9000	14000	It will happen slowly, over many billions of years, but it will happen.
14000	19000	On a universal timescale, stars like our Sun will be gone in no time.
19000	24000	Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective.
25000	27000	The corpses of dead stars.
27000	29000	White dwarfs.
29000	34000	They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe.
34000	39000	What are these strange things, and what happens when they finally die?
39000	54000	How long stars live varies drastically, depending on how massive they are.
54000	58000	For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast,
58000	62000	dying violently in supernova a few million years after birth.
62000	64000	But they're the exception.
64000	69000	97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs.
69000	72000	There are two ways this can happen.
72000	76000	Small stars, so-called red dwarfs, burn out over trillions of years,
76000	79000	until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs.
79000	83000	Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting.
83000	90000	Imagine the Sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity.
90000	93000	The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy
93000	98000	that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance.
98000	102000	When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted,
102000	105000	and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements.
105000	109000	While doing so, it will shed its outer layers.
109000	114000	When this process is over, more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space
114000	118000	as a spectacular planetary nebula millions of kilometers across.
118000	121000	What remains will be its former core.
121000	125000	A white dwarf is born, a star-corped.
125000	128000	While its former self was about 100 times its diameter,
128000	134000	now it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass.
134000	137000	This means it's extremely dense.
137000	141000	A teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car.
141000	147000	Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's.
147000	154000	If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle.
154000	158000	Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible.
158000	162000	Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died,
162000	165000	which probably ruined any planets they once had.
165000	167000	But that's not all.
167000	170000	Since they are so small, a planet would need to orbit them
170000	175000	about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water.
175000	177000	This proximity has up and downsides.
177000	184000	For one, it would tidally lock the planet, giving it a permanent day and permanent night.
184000	188000	At the edges of these day and night zones, life could be possible.
188000	191000	But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output,
191000	195000	so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs.
195000	197000	This is still speculation at this point,
197000	200000	but if we could find a white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around,
200000	204000	we could have a home for many billions of years.
204000	208000	But why do they shine so much longer than other star types?
208000	213000	White dwarfs are very, very hot, up to 40 times hotter than our Sun,
213000	216000	ranking among the hottest objects in the universe.
216000	218000	But they are not incredibly active.
218000	221000	All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go.
221000	224000	Only on its outer layer can it escape into space.
224000	229000	But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction.
229000	233000	The only way energy can escape is by radiation.
233000	238000	This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down,
238000	241000	which may make them humanity's last refuge.
241000	246000	They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe.
246000	252000	According to some estimates, white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years,
252000	255000	10 billion times longer than the universe has existed,
255000	260000	so far into the future that no regular stars will shine anymore,
260000	262000	galaxies will have evaporated,
262000	267000	and only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf.
267000	271000	When this happens, the last hope for life will die off.
271000	275000	Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give,
275000	279000	still massive enough to kill you if you get too close,
279000	283000	so cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe,
283000	287000	so dark that they are practically invisible.
287000	291000	The universe will enter its last stage, heat death,
291000	295000	which will leave the universe unrecognizable.
295000	298000	An absolutely dark and cold graveyard,
298000	303000	with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of light years.
303000	307000	We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end.
307000	311000	If the proton, one of the fundamental parts of atoms, has a limited lifespan,
311000	315000	black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years.
315000	317000	If the proton does not decay,
317000	321000	black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure iron via quantum tunneling,
321000	327000	over a timespan so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay.
327000	332000	These iron spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe.
332000	335000	Nothing new will happen anymore.
335000	336000	Forever.
336000	340000	While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away,
340000	344000	that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all.
344000	347000	It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years.
347000	351000	Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time,
351000	357000	able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets,
357000	361000	and enough time to visit them one day.
363000	366000	Our music is finally available on Spotify and iTunes.
366000	369000	It's composed by our good friends at Epic Mountain,
369000	372000	two guys with a studio who make music for a living.
372000	375000	You can check them out here and follow them on Facebook and Twitter.

378000	381000	It really would be extremely helpful.
