00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Unfortunately, the universe will die.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
It will happen slowly, over many billions of years, but it will happen.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
On a universal timescale, stars like our Sun will be gone in no time.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
The corpses of dead stars.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
White dwarfs.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
What are these strange things, and what happens when they finally die?

00:39.000 --> 00:54.000
How long stars live varies drastically, depending on how massive they are.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
dying violently in supernova a few million years after birth.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
But they're the exception.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
There are two ways this can happen.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Small stars, so-called red dwarfs, burn out over trillions of years,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Imagine the Sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
While doing so, it will shed its outer layers.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
When this process is over, more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
as a spectacular planetary nebula millions of kilometers across.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
What remains will be its former core.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
A white dwarf is born, a star-corped.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
While its former self was about 100 times its diameter,

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
now it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
This means it's extremely dense.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
A teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
which probably ruined any planets they once had.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
But that's not all.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Since they are so small, a planet would need to orbit them

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
This proximity has up and downsides.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
For one, it would tidally lock the planet, giving it a permanent day and permanent night.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
At the edges of these day and night zones, life could be possible.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
This is still speculation at this point,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
but if we could find a white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
we could have a home for many billions of years.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
But why do they shine so much longer than other star types?

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
White dwarfs are very, very hot, up to 40 times hotter than our Sun,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
ranking among the hottest objects in the universe.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
But they are not incredibly active.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Only on its outer layer can it escape into space.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
The only way energy can escape is by radiation.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
which may make them humanity's last refuge.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
According to some estimates, white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
10 billion times longer than the universe has existed,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
so far into the future that no regular stars will shine anymore,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
galaxies will have evaporated,

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
and only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
When this happens, the last hope for life will die off.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
still massive enough to kill you if you get too close,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
so cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
so dark that they are practically invisible.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
The universe will enter its last stage, heat death,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
which will leave the universe unrecognizable.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
An absolutely dark and cold graveyard,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of light years.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
If the proton, one of the fundamental parts of atoms, has a limited lifespan,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
If the proton does not decay,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure iron via quantum tunneling,

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
over a timespan so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
These iron spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Nothing new will happen anymore.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Forever.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time,

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
and enough time to visit them one day.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Our music is finally available on Spotify and iTunes.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It's composed by our good friends at Epic Mountain,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
two guys with a studio who make music for a living.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You can check them out here and follow them on Facebook and Twitter.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And if you like our videos, please consider supporting us on Patreon.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
It really would be extremely helpful.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
If you need an excuse to delay work a little bit longer,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
here's a playlist with more space videos.
