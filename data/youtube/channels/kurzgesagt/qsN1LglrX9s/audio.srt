1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Unfortunately, the universe will die.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It will happen slowly, over many billions of years, but it will happen.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
On a universal timescale, stars like our Sun will be gone in no time.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The corpses of dead stars.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
White dwarfs.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What are these strange things, and what happens when they finally die?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How long stars live varies drastically, depending on how massive they are.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
dying violently in supernova a few million years after birth.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But they're the exception.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are two ways this can happen.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Small stars, so-called red dwarfs, burn out over trillions of years,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Imagine the Sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
While doing so, it will shed its outer layers.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When this process is over, more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
as a spectacular planetary nebula millions of kilometers across.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What remains will be its former core.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A white dwarf is born, a star-corped.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
While its former self was about 100 times its diameter,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
now it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This means it's extremely dense.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
which probably ruined any planets they once had.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But that's not all.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Since they are so small, a planet would need to orbit them

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This proximity has up and downsides.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For one, it would tidally lock the planet, giving it a permanent day and permanent night.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
At the edges of these day and night zones, life could be possible.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is still speculation at this point,

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but if we could find a white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around,

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we could have a home for many billions of years.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But why do they shine so much longer than other star types?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
White dwarfs are very, very hot, up to 40 times hotter than our Sun,

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ranking among the hottest objects in the universe.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But they are not incredibly active.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Only on its outer layer can it escape into space.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The only way energy can escape is by radiation.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down,

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which may make them humanity's last refuge.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
According to some estimates, white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years,

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
10 billion times longer than the universe has existed,

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
so far into the future that no regular stars will shine anymore,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
galaxies will have evaporated,

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When this happens, the last hope for life will die off.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give,

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
still massive enough to kill you if you get too close,

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
so cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so dark that they are practically invisible.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The universe will enter its last stage, heat death,

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which will leave the universe unrecognizable.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
An absolutely dark and cold graveyard,

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of light years.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If the proton, one of the fundamental parts of atoms, has a limited lifespan,

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If the proton does not decay,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure iron via quantum tunneling,

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
over a timespan so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
These iron spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Nothing new will happen anymore.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Forever.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away,

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time,

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets,

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and enough time to visit them one day.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Our music is finally available on Spotify and iTunes.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's composed by our good friends at Epic Mountain,

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
two guys with a studio who make music for a living.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can check them out here and follow them on Facebook and Twitter.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It really would be extremely helpful.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you need an excuse to delay work a little bit longer,
