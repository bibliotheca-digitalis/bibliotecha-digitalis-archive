00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
Time makes sense in small pieces, but when you look at huge stretches of time, it's

00:06.960 --> 00:10.100
almost impossible to wrap your head around things.

00:10.100 --> 00:15.320
So let's start small with minutes, hours, days.

00:15.320 --> 00:20.400
You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working with some coffee in there

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
somewhere.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.100
Please watch less TV.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.640
Now let's look at 2013.

00:26.640 --> 00:32.620
Relatively unnoticed, Hitler's bodyguard died at the age of 96, while in June Edward

00:32.620 --> 00:35.440
Snowden started the NSA scandal.

00:35.440 --> 00:40.720
Moving back a bit, the 21st century is still pretty young and largely shaped by the attacks

00:40.720 --> 00:44.760
on 9-11 that ultimately led to the Third Iraq War.

00:44.760 --> 00:48.920
Oh, and Facebook and smartphones took over our lives.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.640
But we're just getting started.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.640
Let's back up further.

00:56.640 --> 01:03.580
The 20th century has seen its share of conflicts too.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.120
After two devastating world wars, the Cold War lasted for almost the whole second half

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
of it.

01:09.120 --> 01:14.140
An average human lifespan covers most of this stuff as well as the birth of the internet

01:14.140 --> 01:17.280
and the beginning of the Information Age.

01:17.280 --> 01:24.420
The oldest living person on Earth is currently Misao Okawa, who was born in 1898, which means

01:24.420 --> 01:30.220
that her birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.

01:30.220 --> 01:35.600
The last 500 years of human history brought enormous changes to our lifestyles.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.700
Industrialization gave rise to new ideas like communism.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.200
Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.860
The theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in, all in

01:48.860 --> 01:51.220
a few hundred years.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.980
The 15th century was very eventful.

01:53.980 --> 01:59.100
Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle

01:59.100 --> 02:00.500
Ages.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.580
People in the Middle Ages were super into war over territory and religion, but the Black

02:04.580 --> 02:10.860
Plague was far more efficient than war, killing every third European in six years.

02:10.860 --> 02:15.380
Arriving in the Common Era, let's take a look where we came from.

02:15.380 --> 02:21.480
Our current century is tiny, and 2013 is barely visible.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.860
This is recorded human history.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.820
The Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago.

02:27.820 --> 02:31.020
The peak of the Roman Empire was 2,000 years ago.

02:31.020 --> 02:37.820
So to the Romans, the Pyramids were as old as the Romans are to us today.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.600
History starts with writing.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.760
But what happened before that?

02:41.760 --> 02:46.300
About 12,000 years ago, the agricultural revolution took place.

02:46.300 --> 02:51.340
Mankind began farming, which gave rise to the existence of cities and larger communities.

02:51.340 --> 02:55.420
The dominance of the human species over planet Earth really started here.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.900
90,000 years ago, Neanderthals and humans coexist in Europe.

02:59.900 --> 03:05.140
Fun fact, this is roughly the time period a modern spacecraft would need to reach the

03:05.140 --> 03:06.980
nearest star.

03:06.980 --> 03:12.420
Homo sapiens, the modern human, evolved 200,000 years ago.

03:12.420 --> 03:18.460
Looking at all of human history, what we call AD seems pretty small, doesn't it?

03:18.460 --> 03:23.380
Six million years ago, our ancestors and the modern chimpanzee shared a common ancestor

03:23.380 --> 03:25.100
for the last time.

03:25.100 --> 03:30.900
And for 2.75 million years, stone tools were all the rage.

03:30.900 --> 03:36.540
A mere 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion,

03:36.540 --> 03:39.100
which paved the way for the rise of mammals.

03:39.100 --> 03:45.300
But the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for an incredibly long time, over 165 million years.

03:45.520 --> 03:51.460
So long that it means a T-Rex that lived 65 million years ago is closer to seeing a live

03:51.460 --> 03:56.380
Miley Cyrus concert than to seeing a live Stegosaurus.

03:56.380 --> 04:00.260
Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago.

04:00.260 --> 04:04.140
The earliest animals were fish and other small, simple sea creatures.

04:04.140 --> 04:10.140
Then came insects, then reptiles, and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined

04:10.140 --> 04:12.380
the party.

04:12.380 --> 04:18.660
Life itself began much farther back, 3.6 billion years ago.

04:18.660 --> 04:23.500
Before any animals appeared, there were 2.4 billion years when life consisted only of

04:23.500 --> 04:28.060
tiny microbes, countless single-cell bacteria.

04:28.060 --> 04:33.980
For 3 billion years, all life on Earth was invisible to the naked eye.

04:33.980 --> 04:38.220
It's hard to understand how single-celled organisms could develop into complex life

04:38.220 --> 04:41.180
forms like fish or sloths.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.980
The answer is time, a whole lot of time.

04:44.980 --> 04:49.020
2.4 billion years is a lot of time to work with.

04:49.020 --> 04:53.940
4.6 billion years ago, the Sun was born from the remnants of a giant explosion.

04:53.940 --> 04:57.380
60 million years later, Earth formed.

04:57.380 --> 05:02.340
In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth

05:02.340 --> 05:06.220
with large oceans and a moon to send spaceships to.

05:06.220 --> 05:11.900
But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.

05:11.900 --> 05:17.780
13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born, and 600 million years later, our own

05:17.780 --> 05:20.700
galaxy formed from billions of stars.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.780
But what was before the Big Bang?

05:23.780 --> 05:28.000
The truth is, we don't know that yet, and maybe we never will.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.980
But we gave it some colors, so at least we have that.

05:31.980 --> 05:35.780
And there you have it, the past.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.540
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future.

05:39.540 --> 05:45.580
In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible.

05:45.580 --> 05:50.580
The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of the solar system.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.300
Okay, so no more solar system.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.020
And what happens after that?

05:56.020 --> 05:59.700
A few trillion years from now, star production will cease.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.580
And one day, the last star in the universe will die.

06:03.580 --> 06:08.940
The universe will turn dark, inhabited only by black holes.

06:08.940 --> 06:14.620
Long after the last black hole has evaporated, our universe reaches its final stage, something

06:14.620 --> 06:17.240
called heat death.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.780
Nothing changes anymore.

06:18.780 --> 06:24.060
The universe is dead, forever.

06:24.060 --> 06:28.140
Now you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you?

06:28.140 --> 06:29.140
We are too.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.660
It's only natural.

06:31.660 --> 06:35.340
The good news is, this is all far, far away.

06:35.340 --> 06:39.180
The only time that actually matters is now.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.500
That cute girl you like?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
Ask her out.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.780
Time is precious.

06:43.780 --> 06:44.380
Make it count.
