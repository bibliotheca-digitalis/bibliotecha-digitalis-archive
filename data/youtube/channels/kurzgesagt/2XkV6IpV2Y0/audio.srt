1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Time makes sense in small pieces, but when you look at huge stretches of time, it's

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,100
almost impossible to wrap your head around things.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,320
So let's start small with minutes, hours, days.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,400
You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working with some coffee in there

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
somewhere.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
Please watch less TV.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,640
Now let's look at 2013.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,620
Relatively unnoticed, Hitler's bodyguard died at the age of 96, while in June Edward

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,440
Snowden started the NSA scandal.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,720
Moving back a bit, the 21st century is still pretty young and largely shaped by the attacks

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,760
on 9-11 that ultimately led to the Third Iraq War.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,920
Oh, and Facebook and smartphones took over our lives.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,640
But we're just getting started.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's back up further.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,580
The 20th century has seen its share of conflicts too.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,120
After two devastating world wars, the Cold War lasted for almost the whole second half

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
of it.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,140
An average human lifespan covers most of this stuff as well as the birth of the internet

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,280
and the beginning of the Information Age.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,420
The oldest living person on Earth is currently Misao Okawa, who was born in 1898, which means

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,220
that her birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,600
The last 500 years of human history brought enormous changes to our lifestyles.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,700
Industrialization gave rise to new ideas like communism.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,200
Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,860
The theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in, all in

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,220
a few hundred years.

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,980
The 15th century was very eventful.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,100
Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,500
Ages.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,580
People in the Middle Ages were super into war over territory and religion, but the Black

31
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,860
Plague was far more efficient than war, killing every third European in six years.

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,380
Arriving in the Common Era, let's take a look where we came from.

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,480
Our current century is tiny, and 2013 is barely visible.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,860
This is recorded human history.

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,820
The Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,020
The peak of the Roman Empire was 2,000 years ago.

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,820
So to the Romans, the Pyramids were as old as the Romans are to us today.

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,600
History starts with writing.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,760
But what happened before that?

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,300
About 12,000 years ago, the agricultural revolution took place.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,340
Mankind began farming, which gave rise to the existence of cities and larger communities.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,420
The dominance of the human species over planet Earth really started here.

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,900
90,000 years ago, Neanderthals and humans coexist in Europe.

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,140
Fun fact, this is roughly the time period a modern spacecraft would need to reach the

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,980
nearest star.

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,420
Homo sapiens, the modern human, evolved 200,000 years ago.

47
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,460
Looking at all of human history, what we call AD seems pretty small, doesn't it?

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,380
Six million years ago, our ancestors and the modern chimpanzee shared a common ancestor

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,100
for the last time.

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,900
And for 2.75 million years, stone tools were all the rage.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,540
A mere 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion,

52
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,100
which paved the way for the rise of mammals.

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,300
But the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for an incredibly long time, over 165 million years.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,460
So long that it means a T-Rex that lived 65 million years ago is closer to seeing a live

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,380
Miley Cyrus concert than to seeing a live Stegosaurus.

56
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,260
Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago.

57
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,140
The earliest animals were fish and other small, simple sea creatures.

58
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Then came insects, then reptiles, and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined

59
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,380
the party.

60
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,660
Life itself began much farther back, 3.6 billion years ago.

61
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,500
Before any animals appeared, there were 2.4 billion years when life consisted only of

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,060
tiny microbes, countless single-cell bacteria.

63
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,980
For 3 billion years, all life on Earth was invisible to the naked eye.

64
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,220
It's hard to understand how single-celled organisms could develop into complex life

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,180
forms like fish or sloths.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,980
The answer is time, a whole lot of time.

67
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,020
2.4 billion years is a lot of time to work with.

68
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,940
4.6 billion years ago, the Sun was born from the remnants of a giant explosion.

69
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,380
60 million years later, Earth formed.

70
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,340
In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,220
with large oceans and a moon to send spaceships to.

72
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,900
But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.

73
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,780
13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born, and 600 million years later, our own

74
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,700
galaxy formed from billions of stars.

75
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,780
But what was before the Big Bang?

76
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,000
The truth is, we don't know that yet, and maybe we never will.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,980
But we gave it some colors, so at least we have that.

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,780
And there you have it, the past.

79
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,540
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future.

80
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,580
In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible.

81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,580
The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of the solar system.

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,300
Okay, so no more solar system.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,020
And what happens after that?

84
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,700
A few trillion years from now, star production will cease.

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,580
And one day, the last star in the universe will die.

86
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,940
The universe will turn dark, inhabited only by black holes.

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,620
Long after the last black hole has evaporated, our universe reaches its final stage, something

88
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,240
called heat death.

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,780
Nothing changes anymore.

90
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,060
The universe is dead, forever.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,140
Now you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you?

92
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
We are too.

93
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,660
It's only natural.

94
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,340
The good news is, this is all far, far away.

95
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,180
The only time that actually matters is now.

96
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,500
That cute girl you like?

97
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Ask her out.

98
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,780
Time is precious.

99
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,380
Make it count.
