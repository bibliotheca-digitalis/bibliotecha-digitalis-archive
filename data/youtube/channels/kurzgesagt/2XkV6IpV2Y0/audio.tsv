0	6960	Time makes sense in small pieces, but when you look at huge stretches of time, it's
6960	10100	almost impossible to wrap your head around things.
10100	15320	So let's start small with minutes, hours, days.
15320	20400	You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working with some coffee in there
20400	21400	somewhere.
21400	24100	Please watch less TV.
24100	26640	Now let's look at 2013.
26640	32620	Relatively unnoticed, Hitler's bodyguard died at the age of 96, while in June Edward
32620	35440	Snowden started the NSA scandal.
35440	40720	Moving back a bit, the 21st century is still pretty young and largely shaped by the attacks
40720	44760	on 9-11 that ultimately led to the Third Iraq War.
44760	48920	Oh, and Facebook and smartphones took over our lives.
48920	50640	But we're just getting started.
50640	52640	Let's back up further.
56640	63580	The 20th century has seen its share of conflicts too.
63580	68120	After two devastating world wars, the Cold War lasted for almost the whole second half
68120	69120	of it.
69120	74140	An average human lifespan covers most of this stuff as well as the birth of the internet
74140	77280	and the beginning of the Information Age.
77280	84420	The oldest living person on Earth is currently Misao Okawa, who was born in 1898, which means
84420	90220	that her birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.
90220	95600	The last 500 years of human history brought enormous changes to our lifestyles.
95600	99700	Industrialization gave rise to new ideas like communism.
99700	104200	Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute.
104200	108860	The theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in, all in
108860	111220	a few hundred years.
111220	113980	The 15th century was very eventful.
113980	119100	Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle
119100	120500	Ages.
120500	124580	People in the Middle Ages were super into war over territory and religion, but the Black
124580	130860	Plague was far more efficient than war, killing every third European in six years.
130860	135380	Arriving in the Common Era, let's take a look where we came from.
135380	141480	Our current century is tiny, and 2013 is barely visible.
141480	143860	This is recorded human history.
143860	147820	The Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago.
147820	151020	The peak of the Roman Empire was 2,000 years ago.
151020	157820	So to the Romans, the Pyramids were as old as the Romans are to us today.
157820	159600	History starts with writing.
159600	161760	But what happened before that?
161760	166300	About 12,000 years ago, the agricultural revolution took place.
166300	171340	Mankind began farming, which gave rise to the existence of cities and larger communities.
171340	175420	The dominance of the human species over planet Earth really started here.
175420	179900	90,000 years ago, Neanderthals and humans coexist in Europe.
179900	185140	Fun fact, this is roughly the time period a modern spacecraft would need to reach the
185140	186980	nearest star.
186980	192420	Homo sapiens, the modern human, evolved 200,000 years ago.
192420	198460	Looking at all of human history, what we call AD seems pretty small, doesn't it?
198460	203380	Six million years ago, our ancestors and the modern chimpanzee shared a common ancestor
203380	205100	for the last time.
205100	210900	And for 2.75 million years, stone tools were all the rage.
210900	216540	A mere 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion,
216540	219100	which paved the way for the rise of mammals.
219100	225300	But the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for an incredibly long time, over 165 million years.
225520	231460	So long that it means a T-Rex that lived 65 million years ago is closer to seeing a live
231460	236380	Miley Cyrus concert than to seeing a live Stegosaurus.
236380	240260	Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago.
240260	244140	The earliest animals were fish and other small, simple sea creatures.
244140	250140	Then came insects, then reptiles, and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined
250140	252380	the party.
252380	258660	Life itself began much farther back, 3.6 billion years ago.
258660	263500	Before any animals appeared, there were 2.4 billion years when life consisted only of
263500	268060	tiny microbes, countless single-cell bacteria.
268060	273980	For 3 billion years, all life on Earth was invisible to the naked eye.
273980	278220	It's hard to understand how single-celled organisms could develop into complex life
278220	281180	forms like fish or sloths.
281180	284980	The answer is time, a whole lot of time.
284980	289020	2.4 billion years is a lot of time to work with.
289020	293940	4.6 billion years ago, the Sun was born from the remnants of a giant explosion.
293940	297380	60 million years later, Earth formed.
297380	302340	In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth
302340	306220	with large oceans and a moon to send spaceships to.
306220	311900	But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.
311900	317780	13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born, and 600 million years later, our own
317780	320700	galaxy formed from billions of stars.
320700	323780	But what was before the Big Bang?
323780	328000	The truth is, we don't know that yet, and maybe we never will.
328000	331980	But we gave it some colors, so at least we have that.
331980	335780	And there you have it, the past.
335780	339540	Now let's take a look at what we know about the future.
339540	345580	In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible.
345580	350580	The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of the solar system.
350580	353300	Okay, so no more solar system.
353300	356020	And what happens after that?
356020	359700	A few trillion years from now, star production will cease.
359700	363580	And one day, the last star in the universe will die.
363580	368940	The universe will turn dark, inhabited only by black holes.
368940	374620	Long after the last black hole has evaporated, our universe reaches its final stage, something
374620	377240	called heat death.
377240	378780	Nothing changes anymore.
378780	384060	The universe is dead, forever.
384060	388140	Now you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you?
388140	389140	We are too.
389140	391660	It's only natural.
391660	395340	The good news is, this is all far, far away.
395340	399180	The only time that actually matters is now.
399180	400500	That cute girl you like?
400500	402500	Ask her out.
402500	403780	Time is precious.
403780	404380	Make it count.
