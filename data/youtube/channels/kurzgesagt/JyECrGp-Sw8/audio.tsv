0	5360	Many of our viewers have asked us a very serious question.
5360	10480	What if we made a big pile of bombs and exploded every nuclear weapon in the world all at once?
10480	15800	Strangely enough, we couldn't find a good source to answer this question to our satisfaction.
15800	21080	So we gathered together a few scientists to calculate what would happen and find an answer
21080	24920	to this extremely important scientific problem once and for all.
24920	31880	Currently, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on Earth. The US and Russia both have around 7,000,
31880	37820	while France, China, the UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea own around 1,000 between them.
37820	43600	But how much destructive power is this really? Let's try to put these numbers into perspective.
43600	59640	On Earth, there are about 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants.
59640	64480	Some are bigger than others, so we'll assume that on average, we need three nuclear bombs
64480	70000	to completely wipe out one city. This means we could destroy every single city on planet
70000	74680	Earth with our nuclear arsenal, killing more than 3 billion people, roughly half of humanity,
74680	81480	in an instant. And we'd still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left. Now that's what an expert would call
81480	86560	overkill. So we can say with confidence that we have a lot of nuclear weapons and they can do a
86560	93040	lot of damage. But what if we make a huge pile of all 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger? Let's drop
93040	97040	our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, just to show nature who's boss.
97040	103760	Our warheads, piled haphazardly, fit into a small warehouse. A typical US warhead has the
103760	111400	power of 200,000 tons of TNT. So 15,000 warheads would be the equivalent of 3 billion tons of TNT.
111400	116240	For scale, this is enough to rebuild the whole island of Manhattan with every building and
116240	122200	skyscraper using stacks of TNT. The closest thing we can compare to the energy gathered here is a
122400	128280	volcano. One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions in recorded history took place in 1883 on the
128280	134040	island of Krakatoa. The eruption was so powerful that 70% of the island and the surrounding
134040	138840	archipelago was destroyed, killing tens of thousands of people. Its effects were felt
138840	145240	around the world for days after the event. Our nuclear pile contains 15 times the energy of the
145240	154520	Krakatoa volcanic eruption. So let's finally push the button. Three, two, one. In a second,
154520	159360	a fireball 50 kilometers across vaporizes everything in its way and creates a blast
159360	165880	wave that flattens 3,000 square kilometers of forest. Every living thing within 250 kilometers
165880	171080	will start to burn. The explosion will be heard literally around the world as the pressure wave
171080	176840	circles the earth tens of times over the next few weeks. Millions of tons of incinerated material
176840	182120	are catapulted into the atmosphere. The mushroom cloud reaches the outer reaches of the stratosphere,
182120	188080	pushing up against space itself. After things have calmed down, a small crater about 10 kilometers
188080	192160	across is left in the center of the worst world fires the planet has seen in millennia,
192160	198120	spreading throughout South America, burning down forests and cities alike. And now the unpleasant
198120	203880	part begins. Extremely radioactive material will kill living things very quickly and a large area
203880	208160	several kilometers around the crater is now uninhabitable, as is everywhere for hundreds
208160	213280	of kilometers downwind. Much of the fallout is carried high into the atmosphere by the mushroom
213280	219040	cloud and carried around the planet. The amount of radioactive material in the environment doubles
219040	225000	worldwide, which still isn't civilization ending, but we may see more cancer for a while. A portion
225000	229480	of the particles will flow to the edge of space for years and cause a nuclear winter that could
229480	235200	lower global temperatures by a few degrees for a few years. This explosion was pretty bad if you're
235200	240960	in South America and especially Brazil. The Amazon rainforest is pretty much history, which is not
240960	248240	great, but human life will go on. Okay, but what if we explode more nuclear weapons? Let's suppose
248240	253920	humanity decided to mine every bit of uranium on earth and build as many nuclear bombs as possible.
253920	259920	At current usage, it's estimated that there are around 35 million tons of uranium in Earth's
259920	266160	crust, enough to power human civilization for over 2000 years or to build millions of nuclear
266160	271400	warheads. For the sake of argument, let's say we create a pile with a yield of 10 billion Hiroshima
271400	276600	bombs, which makes up a cube three kilometers high that contains roughly the energy of the asteroid
276600	282320	impact that ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, except it's also nuclear.
282320	292320	Three, two, one. Our pile explodes in a fireball stretching so high into the sky that it's visible
292320	298080	from half of South America with so much power that the ground just splashes like water forming
298080	304040	a crater 100 kilometers across. Bedrock on the scale of whole mountain ranges is vaporized in
304040	309200	an instant while thousands of tons of material is catapulted away with such speed that it's ejected
309200	314640	into space. Some leaves earth forever while most of it comes raining down as hot burning
314640	319920	debris that heats up the atmosphere to oven like temperatures killing most big animals and causing
319920	326120	firestorms all over the world. The Earth's crust rings like a bell struck by global earthquakes
326120	330600	stronger than anything in recorded history decimating cities around the world while
330600	336160	hurricane force winds flatten every single tree in South America and wildfires consume the continent.
336160	341960	The abundance of hydrocarbons in the Amazon burned to form ash are cast into the atmosphere
341960	347080	darting the sky and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface dropping temperatures to near freezing
347080	353320	worldwide. The ensuing global winter may last for decades and results in the extinction of every
353320	358640	large animal species, humans included. We could also mention that every corner of the planet is
358640	364280	covered with radioactive fallout but at this point it doesn't matter that much anymore. This is
364320	370040	humanity's extinction event. The astronauts aboard the International Space Station get to enjoy a
370040	375000	great view for a while but it's not unlikely that the spray of rocks blast into orbit will destroy
375000	380400	the station. Those lucky enough to be in bunkers or in submarines deep below the ocean surface may
380400	384680	survive the longest before they exhaust their food supplies and have to venture out for more.
384680	392120	They'll find the world a charred, freezing, radioactive wasteland. The planet itself doesn't
392120	397280	care at all. After just a few million years, the wounds of the explosions have healed and life is
397280	403160	thriving, arguably even more so than when humans were around. If intelligent life emerges again,
403160	408720	it might be able to work out what happened. When they study geology, they'll find a bizarre and
408720	414120	very thin layer of rock covering the entire world enriched in radioactive elements like uranium and
414120	419120	the other nasty things it decays to, mixed with rare earth metals and plastics that humans used.
419120	428400	They would probably be very, very confused. Videos like this one take well over 1,200
428400	433280	hours to finish. Over the years, we put more and more effort into research, conversations
433280	438840	with experts, illustration and animation, sound design and fact-checking. For this video,
438840	443320	we put a lot of extra work into our sources document. You can read how we got to the
443320	447280	information in the video, what our experts thought about it, where they disagreed with
447280	454120	each other. We can take the time to do this because of you, our viewers. Because you watch
