1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Many of our viewers have asked us a very serious question.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,480
What if we made a big pile of bombs and exploded every nuclear weapon in the world all at once?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,800
Strangely enough, we couldn't find a good source to answer this question to our satisfaction.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,080
So we gathered together a few scientists to calculate what would happen and find an answer

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,920
to this extremely important scientific problem once and for all.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,880
Currently, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on Earth. The US and Russia both have around 7,000,

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,820
while France, China, the UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea own around 1,000 between them.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,600
But how much destructive power is this really? Let's try to put these numbers into perspective.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:59,640
On Earth, there are about 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,480
Some are bigger than others, so we'll assume that on average, we need three nuclear bombs

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,000
to completely wipe out one city. This means we could destroy every single city on planet

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,680
Earth with our nuclear arsenal, killing more than 3 billion people, roughly half of humanity,

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,480
in an instant. And we'd still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left. Now that's what an expert would call

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,560
overkill. So we can say with confidence that we have a lot of nuclear weapons and they can do a

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,040
lot of damage. But what if we make a huge pile of all 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger? Let's drop

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, just to show nature who's boss.

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,760
Our warheads, piled haphazardly, fit into a small warehouse. A typical US warhead has the

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,400
power of 200,000 tons of TNT. So 15,000 warheads would be the equivalent of 3 billion tons of TNT.

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,240
For scale, this is enough to rebuild the whole island of Manhattan with every building and

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,200
skyscraper using stacks of TNT. The closest thing we can compare to the energy gathered here is a

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,280
volcano. One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions in recorded history took place in 1883 on the

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,040
island of Krakatoa. The eruption was so powerful that 70% of the island and the surrounding

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,840
archipelago was destroyed, killing tens of thousands of people. Its effects were felt

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,240
around the world for days after the event. Our nuclear pile contains 15 times the energy of the

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:34,520
Krakatoa volcanic eruption. So let's finally push the button. Three, two, one. In a second,

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,360
a fireball 50 kilometers across vaporizes everything in its way and creates a blast

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,880
wave that flattens 3,000 square kilometers of forest. Every living thing within 250 kilometers

28
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,080
will start to burn. The explosion will be heard literally around the world as the pressure wave

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,840
circles the earth tens of times over the next few weeks. Millions of tons of incinerated material

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,120
are catapulted into the atmosphere. The mushroom cloud reaches the outer reaches of the stratosphere,

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,080
pushing up against space itself. After things have calmed down, a small crater about 10 kilometers

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,160
across is left in the center of the worst world fires the planet has seen in millennia,

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,120
spreading throughout South America, burning down forests and cities alike. And now the unpleasant

34
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,880
part begins. Extremely radioactive material will kill living things very quickly and a large area

35
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,160
several kilometers around the crater is now uninhabitable, as is everywhere for hundreds

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,280
of kilometers downwind. Much of the fallout is carried high into the atmosphere by the mushroom

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,040
cloud and carried around the planet. The amount of radioactive material in the environment doubles

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,000
worldwide, which still isn't civilization ending, but we may see more cancer for a while. A portion

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,480
of the particles will flow to the edge of space for years and cause a nuclear winter that could

40
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,200
lower global temperatures by a few degrees for a few years. This explosion was pretty bad if you're

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,960
in South America and especially Brazil. The Amazon rainforest is pretty much history, which is not

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:08,240
great, but human life will go on. Okay, but what if we explode more nuclear weapons? Let's suppose

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,920
humanity decided to mine every bit of uranium on earth and build as many nuclear bombs as possible.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,920
At current usage, it's estimated that there are around 35 million tons of uranium in Earth's

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,160
crust, enough to power human civilization for over 2000 years or to build millions of nuclear

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,400
warheads. For the sake of argument, let's say we create a pile with a yield of 10 billion Hiroshima

47
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,600
bombs, which makes up a cube three kilometers high that contains roughly the energy of the asteroid

48
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,320
impact that ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, except it's also nuclear.

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Three, two, one. Our pile explodes in a fireball stretching so high into the sky that it's visible

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,080
from half of South America with so much power that the ground just splashes like water forming

51
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,040
a crater 100 kilometers across. Bedrock on the scale of whole mountain ranges is vaporized in

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,200
an instant while thousands of tons of material is catapulted away with such speed that it's ejected

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,640
into space. Some leaves earth forever while most of it comes raining down as hot burning

54
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,920
debris that heats up the atmosphere to oven like temperatures killing most big animals and causing

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,120
firestorms all over the world. The Earth's crust rings like a bell struck by global earthquakes

56
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,600
stronger than anything in recorded history decimating cities around the world while

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,160
hurricane force winds flatten every single tree in South America and wildfires consume the continent.

58
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,960
The abundance of hydrocarbons in the Amazon burned to form ash are cast into the atmosphere

59
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,080
darting the sky and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface dropping temperatures to near freezing

60
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,320
worldwide. The ensuing global winter may last for decades and results in the extinction of every

61
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,640
large animal species, humans included. We could also mention that every corner of the planet is

62
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,280
covered with radioactive fallout but at this point it doesn't matter that much anymore. This is

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,040
humanity's extinction event. The astronauts aboard the International Space Station get to enjoy a

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,000
great view for a while but it's not unlikely that the spray of rocks blast into orbit will destroy

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,400
the station. Those lucky enough to be in bunkers or in submarines deep below the ocean surface may

66
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,680
survive the longest before they exhaust their food supplies and have to venture out for more.

67
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,120
They'll find the world a charred, freezing, radioactive wasteland. The planet itself doesn't

68
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,280
care at all. After just a few million years, the wounds of the explosions have healed and life is

69
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,160
thriving, arguably even more so than when humans were around. If intelligent life emerges again,

70
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,720
it might be able to work out what happened. When they study geology, they'll find a bizarre and

71
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,120
very thin layer of rock covering the entire world enriched in radioactive elements like uranium and

72
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,120
the other nasty things it decays to, mixed with rare earth metals and plastics that humans used.

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:08,400
They would probably be very, very confused. Videos like this one take well over 1,200

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
hours to finish. Over the years, we put more and more effort into research, conversations

75
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,840
with experts, illustration and animation, sound design and fact-checking. For this video,

76
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,320
we put a lot of extra work into our sources document. You can read how we got to the

77
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,280
information in the video, what our experts thought about it, where they disagreed with

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,120
each other. We can take the time to do this because of you, our viewers. Because you watch

79
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,720
and share our videos, buy our posters and support us on patreon.com. If you like what we're doing,
