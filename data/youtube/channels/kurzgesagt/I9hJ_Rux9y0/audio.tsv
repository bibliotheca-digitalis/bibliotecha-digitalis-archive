0	8000	Friends make life good. They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable, but fun.
8000	14000	They give us a sense of meaning and purpose, and are a source of security, self-esteem, and happiness.
14000	23000	Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel, and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.
23000	30000	But maybe you have scrolled through your phone unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with, or ask for comfort.
30000	36000	You may realize that you don't have enough friends and feel lonely, and it's not just you.
36000	43000	Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread. Many people want more close friends, but don't know how to get them.
43000	51000	Surprisingly, nowadays, loneliness is highest among young people, whose relationships were also hit especially hard by the global pandemic.
51000	56000	Social distancing stopped teens and young adults from mingling in classrooms, clubs, or dorms.
56000	65000	Millions of friendships may be lifelong friendships that might have blossomed, will never exist, with profound long-term consequences for our collective happiness.
65000	70000	The good news is that it's not too late, and there are lots of friends to be found.
70000	77000	We'll mix scientific information with actionable advice in this video, but we can't address every individual situation.
77000	84000	People, cultures, and schedules are different. If you suffer from chronic loneliness, you can also watch the video we made about it.
84000	92000	Okay, as with all important things in life, making friends is infuriatingly simple, but not necessarily easy.
92000	96000	But it works through a few pretty straightforward mechanisms.
96000	100000	The most important thing about making friends.
100000	105000	People make friends with other people when they spend casual time together.
105000	117000	This is how our ancestors formed their relationships, because humans lived in small, close-knit communities in which options for making friends were limited, so we just formed good relationships with the people who were around us.
117000	121000	This is why it's so easy to form new friendships in school and university.
121000	129000	Society locks you and your peers in a building for several years. You share similar activities, but more importantly, similar schedules.
129000	137000	Overlapping and fluctuating social circles form, naturally giving you regular face time and shared experiences with many different people.
137000	141000	Time to find others with similar world views or senses of humor.
141000	145000	Proximity can be more important than similar interests.
145000	151000	One study found that in student dormitories, the distance between rooms was the strongest friendship predictor.
151000	155000	Living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends.
155000	163000	Another study showed that being physically present in a class a lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you.
163000	169000	So the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world.
169000	173000	This alone can make it happen automatically and trumps all other advice.
173000	180000	But don't forget that making friends is not a numbers game or a competition. Don't compare yourself to others.
180000	184000	Everyone has a social calibrator that can change as you go through life.
184000	189000	Maybe you were more introverted as a teen, but yearn for connection in your twenties.
189000	194000	Maybe you were part of sprawling social circles, but prefer fewer friends in your thirties.
194000	198000	There is no right or wrong, only right for you.
198000	200000	Why we don't have enough friends.
200000	207000	The main reason for lack of friendships is the simple fact that most people don't prioritize friendships nearly enough.
207000	212000	They don't realize until it's too late that retaining friendships demands regular energy and attention.
212000	218000	Although they are so important for happiness, friends often take a back seat to other life decisions.
218000	227000	Work, commuting, romance or kids take up so much time and energy that it's so much easier to crash on your couch and lose yourself in mindless activities.
227000	240000	Especially as an adult, going for a bike ride, getting dinner or visiting a hobby store takes much more mental effort and commitment than it did after school when time ran slower and energy and curiosity were abundant.
240000	243000	But it's not just adults who are too busy for friends.
243000	251000	The average American teenager spends more time on TikTok every day than socializing at parties, events or on the phone with friends combined.
251000	259000	Established friendships don't require the same time investment as early friendships to keep up, but they do require some commitment.
259000	265000	As life distracts you, it's easy to skip out on checking in when a friend goes through exciting or depressing times.
265000	270000	And so many friendships fade for lack of attention, often by accident.
270000	277000	Which is extra tragic because there is never only one person losing a friend, it's always at least two.
277000	282000	Another thing that makes many people vulnerable is the way friendship networks are structured.
282000	287000	The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that on average most people have fewer friends than their friends.
287000	294000	Which makes sense since you're more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends than with someone who has few.
294000	300000	Rather than being densely interconnected, friend networks are often built around central hubs.
300000	305000	So if central people disappear from your life, this can deprive you of many connections at once.
305000	312000	And it can lead to a distorted self-perception that you are less popular than others, although you are perfectly average.
312000	315000	It can get worse quickly with big life events.
315000	320000	Maybe you move for school, work or love and are left without social networks.
320000	325000	Or you had a breakup that left you with the smaller part of the formerly shared social pie.
325000	334000	The reasons why you find yourself with less connection than you want are as diverse as people, but the underlying cause is almost always time.
334000	336000	There is no shortcut.
336000	344000	To make new friends and retain friendships, you have to prioritize relationships, spend time with people in real life and make them feel that you care.
344000	349000	So take a look at yourself and rebalance what you spend your life doing.
349000	351000	How to make new friends.
351000	357000	Studies have shown that new friendships can develop quite quickly, weeks after you meet someone.
357000	367000	But it takes a few months for a casual friendship to become a close relationship, with the biggest impediment being time invested and the quality of your interactions.
367000	374000	To make friends, it helps if you intentionally look for people you have things in common with and who are open to new relationships.
374000	378000	You want to make it easy for yourself, so examine what kind of person you are.
378000	386000	Generally speaking, extroverts tend to crave sensory stimulation, spicier foods, loud music or the excitement of engaging a crowd.
386000	396000	Introverts, often confused with shy people, tend to be more sensitive to sensory stimulants and prefer quieter surroundings, fewer people and even less spicy food.
396000	398000	Different places attract different people.
398000	405000	Not everybody can easily make friends at a bar or a football game, not everybody finds a stroll through a park or a bookstore stimulating.
405000	415000	Men especially form friendships around shared activities, but in general it's a good idea to go to places that feel comfortable, where there are people you might like who do things you find interesting.
415000	427000	Look for local clubs or opportunities to volunteer, check out what hobby stores are around and dust off your space marines or see if there are new D&D groups in your city and ask if you could join one.
427000	434000	Check Meetup apps for gaming nights or wine tasting, join a sports club or look for people who go hiking or want to cook together.
434000	438000	Another obvious avenue is your professional life.
438000	444000	It helps if you work in a job that attracts people like you, so you might consider this when you choose a career.
444000	451000	Deepening your relationship with colleagues can lead to great friendships, especially if you look for peers and there is no power imbalance.
451000	454000	And of course, there are friends you've lost touch with.
454000	457000	You may be able to revive some of these relationships.
457000	461000	In some cases, all it needs is a call or an invitation.
461000	466000	Research shows that more often than not, the other person will appreciate that you've reached out.
466000	470000	There are likely way more opportunities to spend time with others than you are aware of.
470000	474000	And if there aren't, you can take the initiative and create them.
474000	477000	Invitations are signals to start friendships.
477000	484000	So bring people together by having a dinner party, organizing a football game after work or starting a board game group.
484000	498000	Everybody appreciates people who organize fun things, and the simple act of reaching out can kickstart a self-propelling upward spiral of wellbeing, fun and connectedness that can seriously improve the life of everyone around you in meaningful ways.
498000	504000	If you meet someone you vibe with, it's pretty scary to make the first move, but they may feel the same way.
504000	508000	Equally interested in a friendship, but also blocked by fear of rejection.
508000	510000	So it's worth going for it.
510000	516000	Worst case, they're not interested, which will sting for a few hours, but the best case could be a lifelong friendship.
516000	519000	A risk well worth the reward.
519000	524000	Once you've formed early connections, check in whether they have important things happening in their life.
524000	532000	Of course, it's important not to be overbearing, but the more time you invest, the more opportunity you have to engage in meaningful banter or silly jokes.
533000	540000	The fact that friendships take time also means that you need to be patient and kind with yourself, especially if you're out of practice.
540000	545000	Things will not improve overnight, but slowly, step by step, if you keep up.
545000	548000	Open up, care and share.
548000	554000	Many people don't have an issue being around others, but struggle to turn acquaintances into friends.
554000	559000	So let's talk about two important principles that make it more likely that you'll connect.
559000	561000	Caring and sharing.
561000	568000	In general, our favorite topic is ourselves and the things we care about, because we are literally at the center of our own universe.
568000	572000	So people tend to like people who are genuinely interested in them.
572000	577000	So if you want to make friends, your goal should be trying to learn what makes them tick.
577000	582000	Just as important as caring about others is reciprocity and openness.
582000	586000	To connect, you need to share the experiences that made you, you.
586000	591000	Now you don't want to overwhelm the other person and immediately spill out your deepest secrets,
591000	597000	but open up a little and reveal personal things, because this also signals to others that it's okay to do the same.
597000	601000	The best case is that you find shared experiences.
601000	606000	Maybe you both had a hard time in school, maybe you share a passion for weird movies.
606000	613000	Learning about others and sharing personal stories in a balanced way and not overdoing it is not an exact science.
613000	620000	Noticing the line between opening up and oversharing requires practice and depends on the vibe of the conversation.
620000	627000	One of the perplexities of life is that to get something, it can be helpful to convince yourself that you want it less than you do.
627000	632000	In general, it's good to be laid back, have fun, and enjoy yourself.
632000	640000	Do things for yourself without expectations, but also be open to social opportunities and accept invitations if they show up.
640000	642000	And that's basically it.
642000	645000	Give friendships more priority in your life.
645000	649000	Check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun.
649000	655000	Show genuine interest in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too hard.
655000	657000	If you do this, you're on track.
657000	663000	If this sounds a bit scary, the good news is that human brains are hard-wired to seek connection.
663000	669000	It's perfectly normal to seek out new friends, and there are many people who would welcome more close relationships.
669000	678000	There are friendships up for grabs everywhere, and there are plenty of people who will be so happy to have you in their life as a good friend.
678000	680000	Go get to know them.
681000	688000	We want to be part of your friendship journey, so we've created a few things you can share with new and old friends.
688000	692000	Two wormhole pins to connect you and your BFF no matter where you are.
692000	697000	If you want to share something with your entire friend group, get a little bird pin for each of them.
697000	700000	They're all unique but fit together like pieces of a puzzle.
700000	705000	Or get matching posters to let your friends know you're thinking of them.
705000	708000	Or just browse all the sciency things we made for you.
708000	714000	If you like videos like this, getting something from our shop is the best way to support us.
714000	716000	Thank you for watching.
