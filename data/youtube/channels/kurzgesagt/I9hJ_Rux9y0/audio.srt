1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Friends make life good. They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable, but fun.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They give us a sense of meaning and purpose, and are a source of security, self-esteem, and happiness.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel, and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But maybe you have scrolled through your phone unsure who to call to go to a movie with, to celebrate with, or ask for comfort.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You may realize that you don't have enough friends and feel lonely, and it's not just you.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread. Many people want more close friends, but don't know how to get them.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Surprisingly, nowadays, loneliness is highest among young people, whose relationships were also hit especially hard by the global pandemic.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Social distancing stopped teens and young adults from mingling in classrooms, clubs, or dorms.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Millions of friendships may be lifelong friendships that might have blossomed, will never exist, with profound long-term consequences for our collective happiness.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The good news is that it's not too late, and there are lots of friends to be found.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll mix scientific information with actionable advice in this video, but we can't address every individual situation.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
People, cultures, and schedules are different. If you suffer from chronic loneliness, you can also watch the video we made about it.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, as with all important things in life, making friends is infuriatingly simple, but not necessarily easy.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But it works through a few pretty straightforward mechanisms.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The most important thing about making friends.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
People make friends with other people when they spend casual time together.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is how our ancestors formed their relationships, because humans lived in small, close-knit communities in which options for making friends were limited, so we just formed good relationships with the people who were around us.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is why it's so easy to form new friendships in school and university.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Society locks you and your peers in a building for several years. You share similar activities, but more importantly, similar schedules.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Overlapping and fluctuating social circles form, naturally giving you regular face time and shared experiences with many different people.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Time to find others with similar world views or senses of humor.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Proximity can be more important than similar interests.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One study found that in student dormitories, the distance between rooms was the strongest friendship predictor.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Another study showed that being physically present in a class a lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This alone can make it happen automatically and trumps all other advice.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But don't forget that making friends is not a numbers game or a competition. Don't compare yourself to others.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Everyone has a social calibrator that can change as you go through life.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Maybe you were more introverted as a teen, but yearn for connection in your twenties.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Maybe you were part of sprawling social circles, but prefer fewer friends in your thirties.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There is no right or wrong, only right for you.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why we don't have enough friends.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The main reason for lack of friendships is the simple fact that most people don't prioritize friendships nearly enough.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They don't realize until it's too late that retaining friendships demands regular energy and attention.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Although they are so important for happiness, friends often take a back seat to other life decisions.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Work, commuting, romance or kids take up so much time and energy that it's so much easier to crash on your couch and lose yourself in mindless activities.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Especially as an adult, going for a bike ride, getting dinner or visiting a hobby store takes much more mental effort and commitment than it did after school when time ran slower and energy and curiosity were abundant.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But it's not just adults who are too busy for friends.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The average American teenager spends more time on TikTok every day than socializing at parties, events or on the phone with friends combined.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Established friendships don't require the same time investment as early friendships to keep up, but they do require some commitment.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
As life distracts you, it's easy to skip out on checking in when a friend goes through exciting or depressing times.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And so many friendships fade for lack of attention, often by accident.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Which is extra tragic because there is never only one person losing a friend, it's always at least two.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Another thing that makes many people vulnerable is the way friendship networks are structured.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that on average most people have fewer friends than their friends.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Which makes sense since you're more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends than with someone who has few.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rather than being densely interconnected, friend networks are often built around central hubs.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So if central people disappear from your life, this can deprive you of many connections at once.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And it can lead to a distorted self-perception that you are less popular than others, although you are perfectly average.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It can get worse quickly with big life events.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Maybe you move for school, work or love and are left without social networks.

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or you had a breakup that left you with the smaller part of the formerly shared social pie.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The reasons why you find yourself with less connection than you want are as diverse as people, but the underlying cause is almost always time.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There is no shortcut.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
To make new friends and retain friendships, you have to prioritize relationships, spend time with people in real life and make them feel that you care.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So take a look at yourself and rebalance what you spend your life doing.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How to make new friends.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Studies have shown that new friendships can develop quite quickly, weeks after you meet someone.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But it takes a few months for a casual friendship to become a close relationship, with the biggest impediment being time invested and the quality of your interactions.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To make friends, it helps if you intentionally look for people you have things in common with and who are open to new relationships.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You want to make it easy for yourself, so examine what kind of person you are.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Generally speaking, extroverts tend to crave sensory stimulation, spicier foods, loud music or the excitement of engaging a crowd.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Introverts, often confused with shy people, tend to be more sensitive to sensory stimulants and prefer quieter surroundings, fewer people and even less spicy food.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Different places attract different people.

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not everybody can easily make friends at a bar or a football game, not everybody finds a stroll through a park or a bookstore stimulating.

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Men especially form friendships around shared activities, but in general it's a good idea to go to places that feel comfortable, where there are people you might like who do things you find interesting.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look for local clubs or opportunities to volunteer, check out what hobby stores are around and dust off your space marines or see if there are new D&D groups in your city and ask if you could join one.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Check Meetup apps for gaming nights or wine tasting, join a sports club or look for people who go hiking or want to cook together.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Another obvious avenue is your professional life.

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It helps if you work in a job that attracts people like you, so you might consider this when you choose a career.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Deepening your relationship with colleagues can lead to great friendships, especially if you look for peers and there is no power imbalance.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And of course, there are friends you've lost touch with.

74
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You may be able to revive some of these relationships.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In some cases, all it needs is a call or an invitation.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Research shows that more often than not, the other person will appreciate that you've reached out.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are likely way more opportunities to spend time with others than you are aware of.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And if there aren't, you can take the initiative and create them.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Invitations are signals to start friendships.

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So bring people together by having a dinner party, organizing a football game after work or starting a board game group.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everybody appreciates people who organize fun things, and the simple act of reaching out can kickstart a self-propelling upward spiral of wellbeing, fun and connectedness that can seriously improve the life of everyone around you in meaningful ways.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you meet someone you vibe with, it's pretty scary to make the first move, but they may feel the same way.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Equally interested in a friendship, but also blocked by fear of rejection.

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So it's worth going for it.

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Worst case, they're not interested, which will sting for a few hours, but the best case could be a lifelong friendship.

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
A risk well worth the reward.

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Once you've formed early connections, check in whether they have important things happening in their life.

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Of course, it's important not to be overbearing, but the more time you invest, the more opportunity you have to engage in meaningful banter or silly jokes.

89
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The fact that friendships take time also means that you need to be patient and kind with yourself, especially if you're out of practice.

90
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Things will not improve overnight, but slowly, step by step, if you keep up.

91
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Open up, care and share.

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Many people don't have an issue being around others, but struggle to turn acquaintances into friends.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So let's talk about two important principles that make it more likely that you'll connect.

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Caring and sharing.

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In general, our favorite topic is ourselves and the things we care about, because we are literally at the center of our own universe.

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So people tend to like people who are genuinely interested in them.

97
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So if you want to make friends, your goal should be trying to learn what makes them tick.

98
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Just as important as caring about others is reciprocity and openness.

99
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
To connect, you need to share the experiences that made you, you.

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now you don't want to overwhelm the other person and immediately spill out your deepest secrets,

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but open up a little and reveal personal things, because this also signals to others that it's okay to do the same.

102
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The best case is that you find shared experiences.

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe you both had a hard time in school, maybe you share a passion for weird movies.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Learning about others and sharing personal stories in a balanced way and not overdoing it is not an exact science.

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Noticing the line between opening up and oversharing requires practice and depends on the vibe of the conversation.

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One of the perplexities of life is that to get something, it can be helpful to convince yourself that you want it less than you do.

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In general, it's good to be laid back, have fun, and enjoy yourself.

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do things for yourself without expectations, but also be open to social opportunities and accept invitations if they show up.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And that's basically it.

110
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Give friendships more priority in your life.

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun.

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Show genuine interest in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too hard.

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you do this, you're on track.

114
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If this sounds a bit scary, the good news is that human brains are hard-wired to seek connection.

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's perfectly normal to seek out new friends, and there are many people who would welcome more close relationships.

116
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There are friendships up for grabs everywhere, and there are plenty of people who will be so happy to have you in their life as a good friend.

117
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Go get to know them.

118
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We want to be part of your friendship journey, so we've created a few things you can share with new and old friends.

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Two wormhole pins to connect you and your BFF no matter where you are.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you want to share something with your entire friend group, get a little bird pin for each of them.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They're all unique but fit together like pieces of a puzzle.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Or get matching posters to let your friends know you're thinking of them.

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Or just browse all the sciency things we made for you.

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If you like videos like this, getting something from our shop is the best way to support us.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you for watching.
