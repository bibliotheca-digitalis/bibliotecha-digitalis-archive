1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
If you are like most people, there is a gap between the person you are and the person you wish to be.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,520
There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,180
From working out regularly, eating healthily, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more, or simply actually

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,080
doing your hobby instead of browsing Reddit.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,120
But it sometimes feels that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,000
Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,680
Maybe you've tried your hardest to be like that, and it worked for a while.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,720
Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,800
In the end, you always seem to fail, and with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,200
If you believe success and hustle internet, it's all your own fault.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
If you don't succeed, you just didn't want it enough and the failure is all you.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,680
But change is actually hard, and as with most things in life,

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
understanding why makes things easier.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The jungle.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,740
Imagine your brain as a lush and dense jungle.

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,700
Moving through it, say to make a decision to do something, is like moving through an actual jungle. It's hard, and it costs energy.

17
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,700
Your brain hates expending energy,

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,420
so it came up with a trick. All your actions and behaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain.

19
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,880
As you start doing something, you trample down some plants and make rough improvised trails through the undergrowth.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,780
The more often you do the thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes.

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,020
Over time, it turns into a path that is easier to tread, so you take it more often, and it turns into a street.

22
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
As you repeat doing the thing over and over for years, the street turns into a highway.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,620
Traversing it becomes effortless, familiar, and comfortable.

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,720
The more pronounced your brain highways, the more you get used to their comfort.

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,620
So we continue to use them, which means we tend to do what we've always done.

26
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,820
This is why change is hard, especially as an adult when your jungle is crisscrossed by lots of established streets and highways.

27
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,500
To understand how those highways are built, we need to distinguish between two things.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,700
Routines and habits.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,020
The things you do. Routines and habits.

30
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,980
A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry out the same way every time, because they've worked out well for you.

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,340
For example, you get the same ingredients for your favorite dish and cook them in a certain order, because you like the taste of the result.

32
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,340
Or before going to bed, you set an alarm at 6.30, because this is when you want to get up.

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Imagine routines as being executed by a wise planner.

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,340
It's slow and analytical, responsible for strategizing and mental calculations.

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,340
The planner is aware of the future and carefully considers what kind of result you want.

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:26,340
Based on that, it chooses actions to achieve specific outcomes, even if they are uncomfortable, like taking a shower after getting up.

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Routines can eventually turn into habits, which feel much easier, because they're basically a sequence of actions carried out without thinking about them.

38
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,340
You've done them so often before that your brain considers them rewarding and a great response to a situation.

39
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,340
So a habit can feel like you're on autopilot.

40
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,700
You don't have to convince yourself to do something that's a habit, you just do it.

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,700
The important thing about habits is that they are set in motion by triggers,

42
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,700
context cues that can be single things or entire situations that give your brain the signal to start the behavior or action.

43
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,700
You already have a lot of triggers in your life, like when you see your phone,

44
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
you almost always unlock the screen,

45
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
or you reach for the seatbelt when you sit in a car,

46
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,700
or when you buy your coffee before work, you also get a cookie, even though you aren't actually hungry.

47
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler.

48
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
It responds to your immediate desires based on what's around you,

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
without considering any longer-term goals.

50
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
For the toddler, the future doesn't exist and it hates hard work.

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,700
So when it notices a trigger, it steers you to take this easy road inside your brain that leads to a familiar, rewarding result.

52
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Like coffee, the toddler also wants the cookie just because that's what you do every morning.

53
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,700
This rewarding feeling is also how most of your bad habits started.

54
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Chocolate is tasty, browsing Reddit is occasionally mildly entertaining.

55
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,700
This is why you repeat these actions, even if they're bad for you.

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Rewarding feelings associated with an action demand to be repeated, and so a bad habit is born.

57
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,060
While the toddler sounds like a built-in sabotage mechanism,

58
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,060
it is as important as the wise planner, and actually, they work together most of the time.

59
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,060
You need your wise planner for thinking big thoughts and parallel parking, and doing your taxes.

60
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,060
But letting your wise planner do everything would cost too much energy.

61
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Outsourcing mundane and repetitive tasks to habits managed by the toddler

62
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,420
allows your brain to easily manage your daily life while dealing with more complex mental challenges at the same time.

63
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,420
So if we want to change and introduce a new behavior into our lives,

64
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,420
we can actually use these energy-saving mechanisms to make it easier.

65
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,420
We'll focus on small things, not big ones.

66
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,420
Improving your life a little is so much better than aiming high and changing nothing.

67
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Especially because small changes can do a lot over months and years.

68
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,780
If you want to make change easier, the best way may not be to force it with willpower,

69
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,780
but to convince your brain that it's not that big of a deal.

70
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,780
By creating new routines and then turning them into habits.

71
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,780
You want your wise planner to construct that first trail,

72
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,780
and then use your toddler to help initiate the action effortlessly.

73
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,140
Let's say you want to work out to be fitter, a very common goal.

74
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,140
The first thing to do is to break down this pretty vague goal into clear separate actions,

75
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,140
because the idea is to make the action itself as easy a threshold as possible.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,140
So small it's manageable, and so specific that you don't have to think about it a lot.

77
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,140
For example, a tangible, controllable action might be doing 10 squats every morning.

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,500
So you can start by trying to create a routine, but already include clear triggers that the toddler can pick up later on.

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a signal that you always associate with the action.

80
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
They can be visual pointers like seeing a particular object, like your training outfit,

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
or a certain time of day, or a designated place like a nearby park,

82
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
or even better, all of these things combined.

83
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,860
The important thing is that you always start doing your action in a specific context.

84
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,860
This trigger is the start button that will eventually set off the action automatically.

85
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,860
So to establish a home workout habit with 10 squats to begin with,

86
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,860
you could make sure to always do them with your exercise gear on at the same place and time,

87
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
like in your living room at 8am.

88
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Once you have your trigger and action, all you need to do is repeat them regularly,

89
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,860
ideally every day.

90
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,220
If you keep going, they will change from a routine to a habit, from a trail to a highway.

91
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Don't get this wrong, the squats will still take you energy to do,

92
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,220
but the decision to do them will feel much less like a chore and more like a regular part of your day.

93
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,220
While this is simple, it's not easy.

94
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Many things you want to turn into habit don't offer as much instant gratification as wasting time on Reddit.

95
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,580
To make your new action easier to repeat and more likely to be picked up by the toddler,

96
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
try to make it pleasurable.

97
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Not necessarily by rewarding yourself after you've done it,

98
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,580
but by making the action or behavior itself more enjoyable.

99
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Like only listening to your favorite podcast while working out,

100
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,580
or chipping away at your taxes while you wait for civilization to load the next round.

101
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
You need to figure out what works for you.

102
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
In principle, that's it.

103
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Frustratingly simple, like most things you can do to make your life better.

104
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,940
How long it takes for your toddler to take over and establish a habit varies widely.

105
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,940
It depends on the behavior you're trying to get used to,

106
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
what kind of person you are, your stress levels and many more things.

107
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,940
It takes anything between 15 and 250 days until a new habit is kicked off automatically by its trigger.

108
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
You won't know how long it will take for you.

109
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Starting is the easy part, especially in the first week or two.

110
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Continuing to do it every day is the hard part.

111
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
But it does get easier as you keep going.

112
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
There are no silver bullets for change.

113
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,300
But the science of habits is a reminder that it is possible no matter how old or young you are.

114
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Even if you only end up doing a little more good stuff or a few new things,

115
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
that's still a success.

116
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgeable is a million times better than being unhappy about a thing and changing nothing.

117
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,660
In the end, change is a direction, not a destination.

118
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
So now, hoping we've given you a bit of insight and motivation,

119
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,660
here is the thing we made to make this progress easier with design and science.

120
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Please bear in mind you don't need to buy anything to work on yourself.

121
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
This is optional.

122
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,020
Having said that, we struggle with change as much as anyone else,

123
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,020
so we've created our own habit journal as much for ourselves as for you.

124
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Before we printed anything, we tested it on ourselves and got feedback from the Kurzgesagt team and experts.

125
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,020
The idea is for you to track your habit progress for your desired behavior.

126
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,020
There's a tutorial part which guides you through the hardest part of the process step by step.

127
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,380
You'll get helpful pointers, reflect on your progress and how you could make things easier for yourself.

128
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,380
Once you get through the tutorial part, the habit journaling starts,

129
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,380
regularly interwoven with examples, science breaks and reflections

130
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
that we hope will help keep the journey interesting.

131
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Like our gratitude journal, it's cloth-bound, with an embossed hardcover and printed on high-quality paper.

132
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Nice to the touch and with lots of beautiful illustrations,

133
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,740
this book is a companion on your personal change journey, however small or big it may be.

134
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Getting things from our shop is the best way to support Kurzgesagt and what we try to do here on the channel.

135
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Thank you for watching.
