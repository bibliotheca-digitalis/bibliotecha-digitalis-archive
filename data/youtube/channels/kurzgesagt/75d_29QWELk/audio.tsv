0	6720	If you are like most people, there is a gap between the person you are and the person you wish to be.
7800	12520	There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve.
13720	21180	From working out regularly, eating healthily, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more, or simply actually
21360	24080	doing your hobby instead of browsing Reddit.
24600	29120	But it sometimes feels that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person.
29600	34000	Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower.
35040	39680	Maybe you've tried your hardest to be like that, and it worked for a while.
40480	43720	Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways.
44320	51800	In the end, you always seem to fail, and with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself.
52720	57200	If you believe success and hustle internet, it's all your own fault.
57360	61920	If you don't succeed, you just didn't want it enough and the failure is all you.
62520	66680	But change is actually hard, and as with most things in life,
67480	69480	understanding why makes things easier.
78000	80000	The jungle.
80600	83740	Imagine your brain as a lush and dense jungle.
84300	91700	Moving through it, say to make a decision to do something, is like moving through an actual jungle. It's hard, and it costs energy.
92540	94700	Your brain hates expending energy,
94700	101420	so it came up with a trick. All your actions and behaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain.
102100	107880	As you start doing something, you trample down some plants and make rough improvised trails through the undergrowth.
108780	112780	The more often you do the thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes.
113340	120020	Over time, it turns into a path that is easier to tread, so you take it more often, and it turns into a street.
120740	125740	As you repeat doing the thing over and over for years, the street turns into a highway.
126820	130620	Traversing it becomes effortless, familiar, and comfortable.
131620	135720	The more pronounced your brain highways, the more you get used to their comfort.
135820	139620	So we continue to use them, which means we tend to do what we've always done.
140260	147820	This is why change is hard, especially as an adult when your jungle is crisscrossed by lots of established streets and highways.
148820	153500	To understand how those highways are built, we need to distinguish between two things.
154420	156700	Routines and habits.
158100	161020	The things you do. Routines and habits.
162380	167980	A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry out the same way every time, because they've worked out well for you.
168340	175340	For example, you get the same ingredients for your favorite dish and cook them in a certain order, because you like the taste of the result.
176340	180340	Or before going to bed, you set an alarm at 6.30, because this is when you want to get up.
181340	185340	Imagine routines as being executed by a wise planner.
186340	191340	It's slow and analytical, responsible for strategizing and mental calculations.
192340	197340	The planner is aware of the future and carefully considers what kind of result you want.
198340	206340	Based on that, it chooses actions to achieve specific outcomes, even if they are uncomfortable, like taking a shower after getting up.
207340	215340	Routines can eventually turn into habits, which feel much easier, because they're basically a sequence of actions carried out without thinking about them.
216340	222340	You've done them so often before that your brain considers them rewarding and a great response to a situation.
223340	226340	So a habit can feel like you're on autopilot.
226700	231700	You don't have to convince yourself to do something that's a habit, you just do it.
232700	236700	The important thing about habits is that they are set in motion by triggers,
237700	244700	context cues that can be single things or entire situations that give your brain the signal to start the behavior or action.
245700	249700	You already have a lot of triggers in your life, like when you see your phone,
250700	252700	you almost always unlock the screen,
253700	255700	or you reach for the seatbelt when you sit in a car,
256700	261700	or when you buy your coffee before work, you also get a cookie, even though you aren't actually hungry.
262700	265700	Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler.
266700	269700	It responds to your immediate desires based on what's around you,
270700	272700	without considering any longer-term goals.
273700	277700	For the toddler, the future doesn't exist and it hates hard work.
278700	285700	So when it notices a trigger, it steers you to take this easy road inside your brain that leads to a familiar, rewarding result.
286700	290700	Like coffee, the toddler also wants the cookie just because that's what you do every morning.
291700	295700	This rewarding feeling is also how most of your bad habits started.
296700	300700	Chocolate is tasty, browsing Reddit is occasionally mildly entertaining.
301700	304700	This is why you repeat these actions, even if they're bad for you.
305700	312700	Rewarding feelings associated with an action demand to be repeated, and so a bad habit is born.
313060	316060	While the toddler sounds like a built-in sabotage mechanism,
317060	321060	it is as important as the wise planner, and actually, they work together most of the time.
322060	327060	You need your wise planner for thinking big thoughts and parallel parking, and doing your taxes.
328060	332060	But letting your wise planner do everything would cost too much energy.
333060	337060	Outsourcing mundane and repetitive tasks to habits managed by the toddler
337420	343420	allows your brain to easily manage your daily life while dealing with more complex mental challenges at the same time.
344420	348420	So if we want to change and introduce a new behavior into our lives,
349420	352420	we can actually use these energy-saving mechanisms to make it easier.
353420	356420	We'll focus on small things, not big ones.
357420	362420	Improving your life a little is so much better than aiming high and changing nothing.
362780	366780	Especially because small changes can do a lot over months and years.
370780	374780	If you want to make change easier, the best way may not be to force it with willpower,
375780	377780	but to convince your brain that it's not that big of a deal.
378780	382780	By creating new routines and then turning them into habits.
383780	385780	You want your wise planner to construct that first trail,
386780	389780	and then use your toddler to help initiate the action effortlessly.
390140	394140	Let's say you want to work out to be fitter, a very common goal.
395140	400140	The first thing to do is to break down this pretty vague goal into clear separate actions,
401140	405140	because the idea is to make the action itself as easy a threshold as possible.
406140	410140	So small it's manageable, and so specific that you don't have to think about it a lot.
411140	416140	For example, a tangible, controllable action might be doing 10 squats every morning.
416500	423500	So you can start by trying to create a routine, but already include clear triggers that the toddler can pick up later on.
424500	428500	Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a signal that you always associate with the action.
429500	433500	They can be visual pointers like seeing a particular object, like your training outfit,
434500	438500	or a certain time of day, or a designated place like a nearby park,
439500	442500	or even better, all of these things combined.
442860	447860	The important thing is that you always start doing your action in a specific context.
448860	453860	This trigger is the start button that will eventually set off the action automatically.
454860	457860	So to establish a home workout habit with 10 squats to begin with,
458860	462860	you could make sure to always do them with your exercise gear on at the same place and time,
463860	464860	like in your living room at 8am.
465860	469860	Once you have your trigger and action, all you need to do is repeat them regularly,
470860	471860	ideally every day.
472220	478220	If you keep going, they will change from a routine to a habit, from a trail to a highway.
479220	482220	Don't get this wrong, the squats will still take you energy to do,
483220	489220	but the decision to do them will feel much less like a chore and more like a regular part of your day.
490220	493220	While this is simple, it's not easy.
494220	500220	Many things you want to turn into habit don't offer as much instant gratification as wasting time on Reddit.
500580	504580	To make your new action easier to repeat and more likely to be picked up by the toddler,
505580	506580	try to make it pleasurable.
507580	510580	Not necessarily by rewarding yourself after you've done it,
511580	514580	but by making the action or behavior itself more enjoyable.
515580	517580	Like only listening to your favorite podcast while working out,
518580	522580	or chipping away at your taxes while you wait for civilization to load the next round.
523580	525580	You need to figure out what works for you.
526580	528580	In principle, that's it.
528940	532940	Frustratingly simple, like most things you can do to make your life better.
533940	537940	How long it takes for your toddler to take over and establish a habit varies widely.
538940	541940	It depends on the behavior you're trying to get used to,
542940	545940	what kind of person you are, your stress levels and many more things.
546940	553940	It takes anything between 15 and 250 days until a new habit is kicked off automatically by its trigger.
554940	556940	You won't know how long it will take for you.
557300	561300	Starting is the easy part, especially in the first week or two.
562300	565300	Continuing to do it every day is the hard part.
566300	568300	But it does get easier as you keep going.
569300	571300	There are no silver bullets for change.
572300	577300	But the science of habits is a reminder that it is possible no matter how old or young you are.
578300	581300	Even if you only end up doing a little more good stuff or a few new things,
582300	583300	that's still a success.
583660	590660	Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgeable is a million times better than being unhappy about a thing and changing nothing.
591660	595660	In the end, change is a direction, not a destination.
598660	601660	So now, hoping we've given you a bit of insight and motivation,
602660	606660	here is the thing we made to make this progress easier with design and science.
607660	610660	Please bear in mind you don't need to buy anything to work on yourself.
611020	612020	This is optional.
613020	615020	Having said that, we struggle with change as much as anyone else,
616020	620020	so we've created our own habit journal as much for ourselves as for you.
621020	627020	Before we printed anything, we tested it on ourselves and got feedback from the Kurzgesagt team and experts.
628020	632020	The idea is for you to track your habit progress for your desired behavior.
633020	637020	There's a tutorial part which guides you through the hardest part of the process step by step.
637380	643380	You'll get helpful pointers, reflect on your progress and how you could make things easier for yourself.
644380	647380	Once you get through the tutorial part, the habit journaling starts,
648380	651380	regularly interwoven with examples, science breaks and reflections
652380	654380	that we hope will help keep the journey interesting.
655380	661380	Like our gratitude journal, it's cloth-bound, with an embossed hardcover and printed on high-quality paper.
661740	664740	Nice to the touch and with lots of beautiful illustrations,
665740	670740	this book is a companion on your personal change journey, however small or big it may be.
671740	676740	Getting things from our shop is the best way to support Kurzgesagt and what we try to do here on the channel.
677740	678740	Thank you for watching.
