0	11000	Until recently, the vast majority of the world population worked on farms and the total production of the world's economy was mostly the total agricultural output.
11000	20000	And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land. The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year.
20000	25000	The size of the pie was fixed. The world was a zero-sum game.
25000	32000	In such a stagnating world, the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off.
32000	36000	If you take a bigger piece of the pie, someone else's gets smaller.
36000	45000	If you want more food, then conquering, plundering, and stealing are great strategies. Your neighbor's loss is your gain.
45000	52000	This was the state of things for thousands of years. Societies invaded each other constantly to get more pie.
52000	60000	Economic inequality was extreme. Some had all the pie they wanted, while others had to live with the crumbs.
60000	71000	Then the industrial revolution happened and everything changed. We developed machinery, better crops, better fertilizers. Agricultural output skyrocketed.
71000	77000	But we didn't just produce more food, every industrial sector exploded in terms of productivity.
77000	84000	From 1700 to 1870, the production of iron in Britain increased 137-fold.
84000	93000	The industrial revolution led to a previously unimaginable increase in economic output. This altered the nature of our societies.
93000	99000	Economic growth changed the world from a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game.
100000	111000	We had found a way to create a bigger pie. But not only a bigger pie, but a pie that was growing bigger each year. More people could have more at the same time.
111000	123000	This development is spreading and continuing today. Antibiotics kill bacteria, power plants deliver energy, cell phones connect us, planes let us travel cheaply, fridges stall food.
123000	134000	Continuous progress in all sectors of the economy seems normal to us today. But the change from stagnation to economic growth really was the most drastic shift in human history.
134000	142000	How was this possible? At the very core of this massive transformation stand new ideas that lead to innovation.
143000	153000	Innovation has many different definitions. But in the context of this video, we mean better solutions to existing problems and solutions to problems we didn't know we had.
153000	161000	The more you innovate, the more complex and interesting problems you discover as your wishes and needs evolve.
161000	176000	The average citizen in Norway 250 years ago might have wanted some really good shoes. 150 years ago, maybe a bicycle. 80 years ago, a car. 30 years ago, cheap air travel. And so on.
176000	183000	Once we get what we want, we don't stop. We can see how we can improve things even more and how to make things even better.
183000	194000	The new positive-sum world has existed for 0.1% of human history and we have yet to get used to it. It has a consequence that feels really unintuitive.
194000	209000	In a positive-sum world, it's in your personal, selfish best interest that every human on planet Earth is well off. It's good for you if people in obscure parts of countries you've never heard of are prospering.
210000	222000	There is a genuine, selfish argument for making the world a better place. In a positive-sum world, the more people are well off, the better your own life is.
222000	233000	This is because of the nature of innovation. It is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. The supply increases when more people have the freedom and education to contribute.
233000	245000	They become inventors, researchers, engineers, or thinkers that come up with new ideas. The demand for ideas increases as people get richer and can pay for new solutions.
245000	258000	They increase the size of the market for innovations. Innovation follows incentives. So naturally, if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovator's attention and energy.
259000	271000	Improving the lives of those who are worst off has a multiplying effect. It increases demand for ideas while at the same time making it easier for ideas to be produced.
271000	282000	Let's take an example that interests all of us, a cure for cancer. If there are 1 billion people in the world that have the wealth to pay for cancer treatments, innovation will follow this demand.
282000	291000	So hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in medical research. This had a huge effect, but we're still nowhere near to curing all forms of cancer.
291000	306000	Today, every sixth person in the world dies of cancer, and you might be one of them. Now imagine if demand were higher. Imagine instead of 1 billion people being able to pay for a cure for cancer, there were 4 billion, or 7 billion.
307000	317000	Imagine how far medicine could have developed if we'd invested 7 times as much in curing cancer. On top of that, there's so much human potential being wasted right now.
317000	329000	The work of a poor farmer in a developing nation is not useful to you, but if he becomes better off, his children might spend their time in university developing things that are useful to you.
329000	336000	Instead of having some hotspots of innovation in the developed world, we would have many hotspots all over the world.
336000	345000	The research output of humanity would be many times what it is right now. Could we have cured cancer by now if that were the case?
345000	356000	Well, maybe. If we spent 7 times as much on research, had 7 times as many people working on it, and a global network of medical research, things would certainly be further ahead than they are now.
357000	368000	And this is the core of the argument. The more people want the same thing that you want, the more likely you are to get it. That is what it means to live in a positive-sum world.
368000	379000	You don't gain more pie if poor places stay poor. Instead, you get more pie if poor places get richer, contribute ideas, and grow the global pie.
380000	390000	Do you like space travel? Imagine there were billions of people in Africa and Asia with their own space programs, and demand for satellites and moon bases and cities on Mars.
390000	397000	Do you like being alive? A few billion people paying for medical research could literally save your life.
397000	406000	It's in your interest for people around the world to become better off. The faster we get to this version of the world, the better for you personally.
406000	414000	No matter what your motivation is, working on a better world is a very good thing to do. For others. And for you.
