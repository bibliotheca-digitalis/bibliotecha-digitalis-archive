Until recently, the vast majority of the world population worked on farms and the total production of the world's economy was mostly the total agricultural output.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land. The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
The size of the pie was fixed. The world was a zero-sum game.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
In such a stagnating world, the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
If you take a bigger piece of the pie, someone else's gets smaller.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
If you want more food, then conquering, plundering, and stealing are great strategies. Your neighbor's loss is your gain.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
This was the state of things for thousands of years. Societies invaded each other constantly to get more pie.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Economic inequality was extreme. Some had all the pie they wanted, while others had to live with the crumbs.

01:00.000 --> 01:11.000
Then the industrial revolution happened and everything changed. We developed machinery, better crops, better fertilizers. Agricultural output skyrocketed.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
But we didn't just produce more food, every industrial sector exploded in terms of productivity.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
From 1700 to 1870, the production of iron in Britain increased 137-fold.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
The industrial revolution led to a previously unimaginable increase in economic output. This altered the nature of our societies.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Economic growth changed the world from a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game.

01:40.000 --> 01:51.000
We had found a way to create a bigger pie. But not only a bigger pie, but a pie that was growing bigger each year. More people could have more at the same time.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
This development is spreading and continuing today. Antibiotics kill bacteria, power plants deliver energy, cell phones connect us, planes let us travel cheaply, fridges stall food.

02:03.000 --> 02:14.000
Continuous progress in all sectors of the economy seems normal to us today. But the change from stagnation to economic growth really was the most drastic shift in human history.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
How was this possible? At the very core of this massive transformation stand new ideas that lead to innovation.

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
Innovation has many different definitions. But in the context of this video, we mean better solutions to existing problems and solutions to problems we didn't know we had.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
The more you innovate, the more complex and interesting problems you discover as your wishes and needs evolve.

02:41.000 --> 02:56.000
The average citizen in Norway 250 years ago might have wanted some really good shoes. 150 years ago, maybe a bicycle. 80 years ago, a car. 30 years ago, cheap air travel. And so on.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
Once we get what we want, we don't stop. We can see how we can improve things even more and how to make things even better.

03:03.000 --> 03:14.000
The new positive-sum world has existed for 0.1% of human history and we have yet to get used to it. It has a consequence that feels really unintuitive.

03:14.000 --> 03:29.000
In a positive-sum world, it's in your personal, selfish best interest that every human on planet Earth is well off. It's good for you if people in obscure parts of countries you've never heard of are prospering.

03:30.000 --> 03:42.000
There is a genuine, selfish argument for making the world a better place. In a positive-sum world, the more people are well off, the better your own life is.

03:42.000 --> 03:53.000
This is because of the nature of innovation. It is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. The supply increases when more people have the freedom and education to contribute.

03:53.000 --> 04:05.000
They become inventors, researchers, engineers, or thinkers that come up with new ideas. The demand for ideas increases as people get richer and can pay for new solutions.

04:05.000 --> 04:18.000
They increase the size of the market for innovations. Innovation follows incentives. So naturally, if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovator's attention and energy.

04:19.000 --> 04:31.000
Improving the lives of those who are worst off has a multiplying effect. It increases demand for ideas while at the same time making it easier for ideas to be produced.

04:31.000 --> 04:42.000
Let's take an example that interests all of us, a cure for cancer. If there are 1 billion people in the world that have the wealth to pay for cancer treatments, innovation will follow this demand.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
So hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in medical research. This had a huge effect, but we're still nowhere near to curing all forms of cancer.

04:51.000 --> 05:06.000
Today, every sixth person in the world dies of cancer, and you might be one of them. Now imagine if demand were higher. Imagine instead of 1 billion people being able to pay for a cure for cancer, there were 4 billion, or 7 billion.

05:07.000 --> 05:17.000
Imagine how far medicine could have developed if we'd invested 7 times as much in curing cancer. On top of that, there's so much human potential being wasted right now.

05:17.000 --> 05:29.000
The work of a poor farmer in a developing nation is not useful to you, but if he becomes better off, his children might spend their time in university developing things that are useful to you.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Instead of having some hotspots of innovation in the developed world, we would have many hotspots all over the world.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
The research output of humanity would be many times what it is right now. Could we have cured cancer by now if that were the case?

05:45.000 --> 05:56.000
Well, maybe. If we spent 7 times as much on research, had 7 times as many people working on it, and a global network of medical research, things would certainly be further ahead than they are now.

05:57.000 --> 06:08.000
And this is the core of the argument. The more people want the same thing that you want, the more likely you are to get it. That is what it means to live in a positive-sum world.

06:08.000 --> 06:19.000
You don't gain more pie if poor places stay poor. Instead, you get more pie if poor places get richer, contribute ideas, and grow the global pie.

06:20.000 --> 06:30.000
Do you like space travel? Imagine there were billions of people in Africa and Asia with their own space programs, and demand for satellites and moon bases and cities on Mars.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
Do you like being alive? A few billion people paying for medical research could literally save your life.

06:37.000 --> 06:46.000
It's in your interest for people around the world to become better off. The faster we get to this version of the world, the better for you personally.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
No matter what your motivation is, working on a better world is a very good thing to do. For others. And for you.
