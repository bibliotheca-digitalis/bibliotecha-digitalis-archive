880	4160	Supernovae are the most powerful explosions in the universe,
4160	7200	unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies.
8000	10240	We have no real metaphor for their power.
10800	13040	If the sun were to magically go supernova,
13040	18400	it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion every second for weeks.
19680	22480	While supernovae are the engines of creation,
22480	27760	forging the elements that enable life, they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies.
28640	30960	So what would happen if one hit Earth?
40480	43840	There are, roughly speaking, two ways to make a supernova.
43840	47280	Either the core of a massive star implodes, or less common,
47280	51360	a white dwarf gains mass to the point where it ignites explosive nuclear fusion.
52000	55360	The outcome is the same, a supernova explosion.
56320	60640	When we think of an explosion on Earth, we think of something that happens fast and ends.
61200	65440	But a supernova is more like a volcanic eruption followed by a tsunami.
66000	69760	At first, there's a colorful ball of hot, expanding gas,
69760	73680	creating a spectacular cloud that will shine for about a month.
73680	75280	But then, it doesn't stop.
76160	80480	Hot and dangerous gas rushes outwards at speeds of 10,000 kilometers a second
80480	84000	through the near vacuum of space, sweeping up the sparse gas of the galaxy.
84880	88400	This wall of gas expands for tens of thousands of years,
88400	92960	and will eventually span up to dozens of lightyears until it finally cools off
92960	95840	and disperses its substance back into the galaxy.
96800	99920	So what if this star tsunami hits us?
100880	103920	Well, the damage depends on how far away it is.
108560	113200	Humans have witnessed dozens of supernovae, but all of them were thousands of lightyears away.
113760	120160	They appeared as new stars, some outshining the moon, twinkling for a few weeks, and disappearing.
120160	123520	Aside from looking very pretty at this distance, they don't do much to us.
127680	132080	Things begin to get a bit icky once a supernova occurs around 300 lightyears away.
132640	136320	We can expect one this close to us every few million years.
136320	140160	A single star giving the night sky an eerie glow like twilight.
140640	145760	And while this is far enough away and dim enough to not do harm to us, they can affect the Earth.
146400	151200	At these distances, it's like being hit by the last weak waves of the star tsunami.
151920	155040	Not strong enough to do real damage, but still noticeable.
155920	158800	In fact, we know that over the past 10 million years,
158800	161840	multiple supernovae have struck Earth from these distances,
161840	164560	because we can find radioactive isotopes of iron
164560	167040	deep in the rocks and sediments at the bottom of the ocean.
167920	170640	Amazingly, these supernovae around the solar system
170640	175200	have cleared a 1000 lightyear wide pocket of space that's called the local bubble.
175920	178880	They blew away the interstellar gas and dust,
178880	182720	creating a lumpy wall of gas that's now a cradle for star formation.
183840	186720	Stage 3, 150 lightyears away.
188080	191760	Once a supernova happens much closer than 300 lightyears,
191760	194480	we're approaching the zone where it does real damage.
195280	198640	Stars have extremely powerful magnetic fields.
198640	203760	When they die, the tsunami of dead star actually retains a lot of this magnetic energy
203760	206320	woven through the shockwave that expands outwards.
207200	211760	In this highly magnetized cloud, we get conditions like in a huge particle accelerator
211760	217280	that's accelerating charged particles like protons, nuclei, and electrons to immense speeds.
217280	222560	Which means we have an expanding cloud that is shooting deadly radiation in all directions,
222560	225920	long after the bright light from the initial explosion has faded away.
226640	228960	If a supernova happens too close by,
228960	233840	waves of these cosmic rays will wash over the solar system for thousands of years.
234720	238640	While we're mostly protected on Earth's surface by the atmosphere and ozone layer,
238640	242560	the influx of extra radiation will still increase cancer and mutation rates.
243200	246640	Not enough to cause a mass extinction, but it will be noticeable.
247360	249920	Spaceflight would become impossible in the solar system,
249920	253040	as astronauts wouldn't survive the waves of radiation for long.
253920	258560	We don't know exactly how bad this would be, but a supernova that is close enough
258560	262960	may trap our species on Earth for generations, maybe thousands of years.
263680	265360	It only gets worse from here.
266080	268880	Stage four, closer than 100 lightyears.
269760	272400	Within 100 lightyears, things get bad,
272400	276320	as a supernova disrupts our climate in ways that we don't fully understand yet.
277040	280240	There are a few unpleasant things happening all one after another.
280800	283840	First, the high-energy photons arrive from the explosion,
283840	287360	followed by many decades of radiation from the radioactive tsunami,
287360	292640	both of which seriously damage the ozone layer, Earth's shield against harmful radiation.
292640	296960	The ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation by breaking apart ozone,
296960	303120	O3, into O2 and a free oxygen atom, which later reforms back into another ozone molecule.
303760	308320	But the supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen,
308320	311520	breaking the cycle, and depleting the ozone layer quickly.
312320	313840	Without a radiation shield,
313840	319200	everybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation from our sun.
319200	323760	Cancer rates would skyrocket, and just going outside during the day could be life-threatening.
324480	329040	The extra radiation would also kill a lot, if not most, of the plankton in the oceans
329040	332800	that live near the surface and are the basis for the marine food chains.
333360	335280	This leads to a mass extinction.
335280	338960	Worse still, supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere,
338960	342800	which means that it would punch through molecules and knock electrons off nuclei,
342800	347840	leaving them charged. These charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather
347840	349600	and form massive global clouds.
350320	353920	In the worst case, they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age.
354960	360080	In fact, it's thought that the ice age two and a half million years ago was caused by a supernova.
360080	363920	Some scientists even think that a supernova about 60 light years away
363920	368160	might have been the cause of the Devonian mass extinction 350 million years ago.
368880	370320	But wait, there's more.
371040	375680	The electrons punched free by the radiation form enormous electric avalanches,
375680	377360	or in other words, lightning.
378000	381200	Earth is hit by some of the worst thunderstorms in millions of years.
381920	386400	The intense lightning causes global wildfires that consume forests and crops,
386400	391200	devastate cities, disrupt our electrical grids and global supply chains,
391200	394800	all while a decimated ozone layer leaks deadly radiation.
395840	400560	While in the past, the ecosystem may have bounced back from a nearby supernova after a few thousand
400560	405280	or million years, there's no guarantee modern civilization can take a hit of this magnitude.
405840	409680	We would face food shortages, skyrocketing prices and wars
409680	412560	as nations struggle to not be consumed by chaos.
413360	417120	So a supernova this close would at the very least do significant damage
417120	421520	for hundreds or thousands of years, if not end our modern civilization,
421520	424240	and with its millions or even billions of lives.
424960	428320	Still, humanity would likely survive and could recover.
433200	437840	A supernova closer than 25 light years means that we're in its kill radius,
437920	440320	where a mass extinction is all but guaranteed.
440880	443680	Probably about half of the ozone layer would be destroyed,
443680	447680	and massive climatic disruption on a scale we've never witnessed would ravage Earth.
448240	452160	Entire ecosystems would swiftly be wiped out by radiation
452160	454720	as global wildfires envelop the planet.
455280	460000	All the things described before happen, but way more intensely and much faster.
460560	464400	A few people might survive for years in bunkers if they have food supplies,
464400	468560	but the world they return to will be devastated and hostile to life
468560	473680	for hundreds of thousands of years. Human extinction is extremely likely.
477840	482640	Being any closer to a supernova is very unlikely because space is big,
483200	487200	but the effects would be extreme. Even from four light years away,
487200	491920	the distance to Alpha Centauri, a supernova would be almost as bright as the sun in the sky.
492480	496800	While casting two shadows could be fun for a few hours, within days the Earth's surface
496800	501040	gets as hot as a sauna, baking the surface for weeks until the explosion fades.
501600	506800	The surface of Earth burns, scoured of life. Even the oceans aren't safe.
506800	510560	The massive amount of radiation that follows burns away the ozone layer,
510560	515920	killing everything that sees sunlight. It would be the largest extinction event in history,
515920	520240	reducing life to a few survivors in the deep sea and critters in the deep soil.
520960	522720	Life basically has to start over.
524240	526720	Conclusion. How worried do you need to be?
527840	534000	So, should you worry? No. Fortunately, there are only a handful of stars that may explode
534000	538240	within 1000 light years of Earth, and none are close enough to be a serious threat.
538960	543200	Even better, these stars will probably not go supernova for many millions of years.
544160	548560	So you are safe. But there's no guarantee for the far future.
548560	554160	As stars orbit the galaxy, our descendants may find themselves dangerously close to a supernova.
554160	560000	But by then, a far more advanced and wiser humanity will hopefully be able to just
560000	566720	move out of the way. In any case, you can sleep well tonight, under the beautiful night sky.
