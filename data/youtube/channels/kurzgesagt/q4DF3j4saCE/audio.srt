1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,160
Supernovae are the most powerful explosions in the universe,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,200
unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
We have no real metaphor for their power.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,040
If the sun were to magically go supernova,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,400
it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion every second for weeks.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
While supernovae are the engines of creation,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,760
forging the elements that enable life, they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
So what would happen if one hit Earth?

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,840
There are, roughly speaking, two ways to make a supernova.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,280
Either the core of a massive star implodes, or less common,

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
a white dwarf gains mass to the point where it ignites explosive nuclear fusion.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
The outcome is the same, a supernova explosion.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
When we think of an explosion on Earth, we think of something that happens fast and ends.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,440
But a supernova is more like a volcanic eruption followed by a tsunami.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
At first, there's a colorful ball of hot, expanding gas,

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
creating a spectacular cloud that will shine for about a month.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
But then, it doesn't stop.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,480
Hot and dangerous gas rushes outwards at speeds of 10,000 kilometers a second

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,000
through the near vacuum of space, sweeping up the sparse gas of the galaxy.

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,400
This wall of gas expands for tens of thousands of years,

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,960
and will eventually span up to dozens of lightyears until it finally cools off

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
and disperses its substance back into the galaxy.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,920
So what if this star tsunami hits us?

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
Well, the damage depends on how far away it is.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
Humans have witnessed dozens of supernovae, but all of them were thousands of lightyears away.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,160
They appeared as new stars, some outshining the moon, twinkling for a few weeks, and disappearing.

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,520
Aside from looking very pretty at this distance, they don't do much to us.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
Things begin to get a bit icky once a supernova occurs around 300 lightyears away.

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,320
We can expect one this close to us every few million years.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,160
A single star giving the night sky an eerie glow like twilight.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,760
And while this is far enough away and dim enough to not do harm to us, they can affect the Earth.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
At these distances, it's like being hit by the last weak waves of the star tsunami.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
Not strong enough to do real damage, but still noticeable.

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
In fact, we know that over the past 10 million years,

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
multiple supernovae have struck Earth from these distances,

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
because we can find radioactive isotopes of iron

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
deep in the rocks and sediments at the bottom of the ocean.

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
Amazingly, these supernovae around the solar system

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
have cleared a 1000 lightyear wide pocket of space that's called the local bubble.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,880
They blew away the interstellar gas and dust,

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,720
creating a lumpy wall of gas that's now a cradle for star formation.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Stage 3, 150 lightyears away.

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
Once a supernova happens much closer than 300 lightyears,

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
we're approaching the zone where it does real damage.

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
Stars have extremely powerful magnetic fields.

46
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,760
When they die, the tsunami of dead star actually retains a lot of this magnetic energy

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,320
woven through the shockwave that expands outwards.

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,760
In this highly magnetized cloud, we get conditions like in a huge particle accelerator

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,280
that's accelerating charged particles like protons, nuclei, and electrons to immense speeds.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
Which means we have an expanding cloud that is shooting deadly radiation in all directions,

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
long after the bright light from the initial explosion has faded away.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,960
If a supernova happens too close by,

53
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,840
waves of these cosmic rays will wash over the solar system for thousands of years.

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
While we're mostly protected on Earth's surface by the atmosphere and ozone layer,

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
the influx of extra radiation will still increase cancer and mutation rates.

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,640
Not enough to cause a mass extinction, but it will be noticeable.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,920
Spaceflight would become impossible in the solar system,

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
as astronauts wouldn't survive the waves of radiation for long.

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
We don't know exactly how bad this would be, but a supernova that is close enough

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,960
may trap our species on Earth for generations, maybe thousands of years.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
It only gets worse from here.

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Stage four, closer than 100 lightyears.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,400
Within 100 lightyears, things get bad,

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
as a supernova disrupts our climate in ways that we don't fully understand yet.

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
There are a few unpleasant things happening all one after another.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
First, the high-energy photons arrive from the explosion,

67
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
followed by many decades of radiation from the radioactive tsunami,

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,640
both of which seriously damage the ozone layer, Earth's shield against harmful radiation.

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,960
The ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation by breaking apart ozone,

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,120
O3, into O2 and a free oxygen atom, which later reforms back into another ozone molecule.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,320
But the supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen,

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,520
breaking the cycle, and depleting the ozone layer quickly.

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
Without a radiation shield,

74
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,200
everybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation from our sun.

75
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,760
Cancer rates would skyrocket, and just going outside during the day could be life-threatening.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,040
The extra radiation would also kill a lot, if not most, of the plankton in the oceans

77
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,800
that live near the surface and are the basis for the marine food chains.

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
This leads to a mass extinction.

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
Worse still, supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere,

80
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
which means that it would punch through molecules and knock electrons off nuclei,

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
leaving them charged. These charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
and form massive global clouds.

83
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,920
In the worst case, they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age.

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,080
In fact, it's thought that the ice age two and a half million years ago was caused by a supernova.

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Some scientists even think that a supernova about 60 light years away

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,160
might have been the cause of the Devonian mass extinction 350 million years ago.

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
But wait, there's more.

88
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,680
The electrons punched free by the radiation form enormous electric avalanches,

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
or in other words, lightning.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,200
Earth is hit by some of the worst thunderstorms in millions of years.

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,400
The intense lightning causes global wildfires that consume forests and crops,

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,200
devastate cities, disrupt our electrical grids and global supply chains,

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,800
all while a decimated ozone layer leaks deadly radiation.

94
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,560
While in the past, the ecosystem may have bounced back from a nearby supernova after a few thousand

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,280
or million years, there's no guarantee modern civilization can take a hit of this magnitude.

96
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
We would face food shortages, skyrocketing prices and wars

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,560
as nations struggle to not be consumed by chaos.

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,120
So a supernova this close would at the very least do significant damage

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,520
for hundreds or thousands of years, if not end our modern civilization,

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
and with its millions or even billions of lives.

101
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,320
Still, humanity would likely survive and could recover.

102
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,840
A supernova closer than 25 light years means that we're in its kill radius,

103
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
where a mass extinction is all but guaranteed.

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,680
Probably about half of the ozone layer would be destroyed,

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
and massive climatic disruption on a scale we've never witnessed would ravage Earth.

106
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
Entire ecosystems would swiftly be wiped out by radiation

107
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,720
as global wildfires envelop the planet.

108
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
All the things described before happen, but way more intensely and much faster.

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
A few people might survive for years in bunkers if they have food supplies,

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
but the world they return to will be devastated and hostile to life

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,680
for hundreds of thousands of years. Human extinction is extremely likely.

112
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,640
Being any closer to a supernova is very unlikely because space is big,

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,200
but the effects would be extreme. Even from four light years away,

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,920
the distance to Alpha Centauri, a supernova would be almost as bright as the sun in the sky.

115
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,800
While casting two shadows could be fun for a few hours, within days the Earth's surface

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,040
gets as hot as a sauna, baking the surface for weeks until the explosion fades.

117
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,800
The surface of Earth burns, scoured of life. Even the oceans aren't safe.

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
The massive amount of radiation that follows burns away the ozone layer,

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,920
killing everything that sees sunlight. It would be the largest extinction event in history,

120
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,240
reducing life to a few survivors in the deep sea and critters in the deep soil.

121
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
Life basically has to start over.

122
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Conclusion. How worried do you need to be?

123
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,000
So, should you worry? No. Fortunately, there are only a handful of stars that may explode

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
within 1000 light years of Earth, and none are close enough to be a serious threat.

125
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Even better, these stars will probably not go supernova for many millions of years.

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
So you are safe. But there's no guarantee for the far future.

127
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,160
As stars orbit the galaxy, our descendants may find themselves dangerously close to a supernova.

128
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,000
But by then, a far more advanced and wiser humanity will hopefully be able to just

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
move out of the way. In any case, you can sleep well tonight, under the beautiful night sky.

130
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,080
And if you dream about understanding the physics behind this video and others,
