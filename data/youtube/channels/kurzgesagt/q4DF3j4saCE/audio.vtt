00:00.880 --> 00:04.160
Supernovae are the most powerful explosions in the universe,

00:04.160 --> 00:07.200
unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.240
We have no real metaphor for their power.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.040
If the sun were to magically go supernova,

00:13.040 --> 00:18.400
it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion every second for weeks.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.480
While supernovae are the engines of creation,

00:22.480 --> 00:27.760
forging the elements that enable life, they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.960
So what would happen if one hit Earth?

00:40.480 --> 00:43.840
There are, roughly speaking, two ways to make a supernova.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.280
Either the core of a massive star implodes, or less common,

00:47.280 --> 00:51.360
a white dwarf gains mass to the point where it ignites explosive nuclear fusion.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.360
The outcome is the same, a supernova explosion.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.640
When we think of an explosion on Earth, we think of something that happens fast and ends.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.440
But a supernova is more like a volcanic eruption followed by a tsunami.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.760
At first, there's a colorful ball of hot, expanding gas,

01:09.760 --> 01:13.680
creating a spectacular cloud that will shine for about a month.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.280
But then, it doesn't stop.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.480
Hot and dangerous gas rushes outwards at speeds of 10,000 kilometers a second

01:20.480 --> 01:24.000
through the near vacuum of space, sweeping up the sparse gas of the galaxy.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.400
This wall of gas expands for tens of thousands of years,

01:28.400 --> 01:32.960
and will eventually span up to dozens of lightyears until it finally cools off

01:32.960 --> 01:35.840
and disperses its substance back into the galaxy.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.920
So what if this star tsunami hits us?

01:40.880 --> 01:43.920
Well, the damage depends on how far away it is.

01:48.560 --> 01:53.200
Humans have witnessed dozens of supernovae, but all of them were thousands of lightyears away.

01:53.760 --> 02:00.160
They appeared as new stars, some outshining the moon, twinkling for a few weeks, and disappearing.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.520
Aside from looking very pretty at this distance, they don't do much to us.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.080
Things begin to get a bit icky once a supernova occurs around 300 lightyears away.

02:12.640 --> 02:16.320
We can expect one this close to us every few million years.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.160
A single star giving the night sky an eerie glow like twilight.

02:20.640 --> 02:25.760
And while this is far enough away and dim enough to not do harm to us, they can affect the Earth.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.200
At these distances, it's like being hit by the last weak waves of the star tsunami.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.040
Not strong enough to do real damage, but still noticeable.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.800
In fact, we know that over the past 10 million years,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.840
multiple supernovae have struck Earth from these distances,

02:41.840 --> 02:44.560
because we can find radioactive isotopes of iron

02:44.560 --> 02:47.040
deep in the rocks and sediments at the bottom of the ocean.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.640
Amazingly, these supernovae around the solar system

02:50.640 --> 02:55.200
have cleared a 1000 lightyear wide pocket of space that's called the local bubble.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.880
They blew away the interstellar gas and dust,

02:58.880 --> 03:02.720
creating a lumpy wall of gas that's now a cradle for star formation.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.720
Stage 3, 150 lightyears away.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.760
Once a supernova happens much closer than 300 lightyears,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.480
we're approaching the zone where it does real damage.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.640
Stars have extremely powerful magnetic fields.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.760
When they die, the tsunami of dead star actually retains a lot of this magnetic energy

03:23.760 --> 03:26.320
woven through the shockwave that expands outwards.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.760
In this highly magnetized cloud, we get conditions like in a huge particle accelerator

03:31.760 --> 03:37.280
that's accelerating charged particles like protons, nuclei, and electrons to immense speeds.

03:37.280 --> 03:42.560
Which means we have an expanding cloud that is shooting deadly radiation in all directions,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.920
long after the bright light from the initial explosion has faded away.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.960
If a supernova happens too close by,

03:48.960 --> 03:53.840
waves of these cosmic rays will wash over the solar system for thousands of years.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.640
While we're mostly protected on Earth's surface by the atmosphere and ozone layer,

03:58.640 --> 04:02.560
the influx of extra radiation will still increase cancer and mutation rates.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.640
Not enough to cause a mass extinction, but it will be noticeable.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.920
Spaceflight would become impossible in the solar system,

04:09.920 --> 04:13.040
as astronauts wouldn't survive the waves of radiation for long.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.560
We don't know exactly how bad this would be, but a supernova that is close enough

04:18.560 --> 04:22.960
may trap our species on Earth for generations, maybe thousands of years.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.360
It only gets worse from here.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.880
Stage four, closer than 100 lightyears.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.400
Within 100 lightyears, things get bad,

04:32.400 --> 04:36.320
as a supernova disrupts our climate in ways that we don't fully understand yet.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.240
There are a few unpleasant things happening all one after another.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.840
First, the high-energy photons arrive from the explosion,

04:43.840 --> 04:47.360
followed by many decades of radiation from the radioactive tsunami,

04:47.360 --> 04:52.640
both of which seriously damage the ozone layer, Earth's shield against harmful radiation.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.960
The ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation by breaking apart ozone,

04:56.960 --> 05:03.120
O3, into O2 and a free oxygen atom, which later reforms back into another ozone molecule.

05:03.760 --> 05:08.320
But the supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen,

05:08.320 --> 05:11.520
breaking the cycle, and depleting the ozone layer quickly.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.840
Without a radiation shield,

05:13.840 --> 05:19.200
everybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation from our sun.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.760
Cancer rates would skyrocket, and just going outside during the day could be life-threatening.

05:24.480 --> 05:29.040
The extra radiation would also kill a lot, if not most, of the plankton in the oceans

05:29.040 --> 05:32.800
that live near the surface and are the basis for the marine food chains.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.280
This leads to a mass extinction.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.960
Worse still, supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere,

05:38.960 --> 05:42.800
which means that it would punch through molecules and knock electrons off nuclei,

05:42.800 --> 05:47.840
leaving them charged. These charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather

05:47.840 --> 05:49.600
and form massive global clouds.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.920
In the worst case, they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.080
In fact, it's thought that the ice age two and a half million years ago was caused by a supernova.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.920
Some scientists even think that a supernova about 60 light years away

06:03.920 --> 06:08.160
might have been the cause of the Devonian mass extinction 350 million years ago.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.320
But wait, there's more.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.680
The electrons punched free by the radiation form enormous electric avalanches,

06:15.680 --> 06:17.360
or in other words, lightning.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.200
Earth is hit by some of the worst thunderstorms in millions of years.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.400
The intense lightning causes global wildfires that consume forests and crops,

06:26.400 --> 06:31.200
devastate cities, disrupt our electrical grids and global supply chains,

06:31.200 --> 06:34.800
all while a decimated ozone layer leaks deadly radiation.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.560
While in the past, the ecosystem may have bounced back from a nearby supernova after a few thousand

06:40.560 --> 06:45.280
or million years, there's no guarantee modern civilization can take a hit of this magnitude.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.680
We would face food shortages, skyrocketing prices and wars

06:49.680 --> 06:52.560
as nations struggle to not be consumed by chaos.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.120
So a supernova this close would at the very least do significant damage

06:57.120 --> 07:01.520
for hundreds or thousands of years, if not end our modern civilization,

07:01.520 --> 07:04.240
and with its millions or even billions of lives.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.320
Still, humanity would likely survive and could recover.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.840
A supernova closer than 25 light years means that we're in its kill radius,

07:17.920 --> 07:20.320
where a mass extinction is all but guaranteed.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.680
Probably about half of the ozone layer would be destroyed,

07:23.680 --> 07:27.680
and massive climatic disruption on a scale we've never witnessed would ravage Earth.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.160
Entire ecosystems would swiftly be wiped out by radiation

07:32.160 --> 07:34.720
as global wildfires envelop the planet.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.000
All the things described before happen, but way more intensely and much faster.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.400
A few people might survive for years in bunkers if they have food supplies,

07:44.400 --> 07:48.560
but the world they return to will be devastated and hostile to life

07:48.560 --> 07:53.680
for hundreds of thousands of years. Human extinction is extremely likely.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.640
Being any closer to a supernova is very unlikely because space is big,

08:03.200 --> 08:07.200
but the effects would be extreme. Even from four light years away,

08:07.200 --> 08:11.920
the distance to Alpha Centauri, a supernova would be almost as bright as the sun in the sky.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.800
While casting two shadows could be fun for a few hours, within days the Earth's surface

08:16.800 --> 08:21.040
gets as hot as a sauna, baking the surface for weeks until the explosion fades.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.800
The surface of Earth burns, scoured of life. Even the oceans aren't safe.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.560
The massive amount of radiation that follows burns away the ozone layer,

08:30.560 --> 08:35.920
killing everything that sees sunlight. It would be the largest extinction event in history,

08:35.920 --> 08:40.240
reducing life to a few survivors in the deep sea and critters in the deep soil.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.720
Life basically has to start over.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.720
Conclusion. How worried do you need to be?

08:47.840 --> 08:54.000
So, should you worry? No. Fortunately, there are only a handful of stars that may explode

08:54.000 --> 08:58.240
within 1000 light years of Earth, and none are close enough to be a serious threat.

08:58.960 --> 09:03.200
Even better, these stars will probably not go supernova for many millions of years.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.560
So you are safe. But there's no guarantee for the far future.

09:08.560 --> 09:14.160
As stars orbit the galaxy, our descendants may find themselves dangerously close to a supernova.

09:14.160 --> 09:20.000
But by then, a far more advanced and wiser humanity will hopefully be able to just

09:20.000 --> 09:26.720
move out of the way. In any case, you can sleep well tonight, under the beautiful night sky.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.080
