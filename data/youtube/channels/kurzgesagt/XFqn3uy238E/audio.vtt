00:00.000 --> 00:07.380
Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one, because our videos distill

00:07.380 --> 00:14.300
very complex subjects into flashy 10-minute pieces and, unfortunately, reality is, well,

00:14.300 --> 00:15.300
complicated.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.340
The question of how we deal with that is central to what we do on this channel and something

00:20.340 --> 00:21.620
we think about a lot.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.500
What we mean by lying is the concept of lies to children.

00:35.500 --> 00:40.500
The idea that on the path to explaining something complicated, you start off with a little lie,

00:40.500 --> 00:45.540
a useful oversimplification that makes it easier to grasp a concept.

00:45.540 --> 00:49.940
For example, as a kid you learned that the Earth is a sphere orbiting the sun with planet

00:49.940 --> 00:50.940
bodies.

00:50.940 --> 00:55.280
But it's not actually a sphere and the bodies are super different in size and not close

00:55.280 --> 00:57.140
to each other at all.

00:57.140 --> 01:02.700
By beginning at a place of oversimplification, you're building a framework, a foundation,

01:02.700 --> 01:07.960
that you can then build upon and add nuance and complexity later on.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.080
Step by step, you're getting towards the real gist of the complicated subject.

01:13.080 --> 01:19.480
Science communication has to use lies to children to some degree or it turns into science education.

01:19.480 --> 01:24.140
And getting a proper education in all of the scientific fields would take years of intense

01:24.140 --> 01:26.480
study to become fluent in them.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.260
As a species, we have a major interest in summarizing science and its advancements and

01:31.260 --> 01:35.640
educating as many people about it as possible because we all benefit if more people have

01:35.640 --> 01:38.940
a fact-based scientific worldview.

01:38.940 --> 01:43.540
We will discuss what science is and how it works in different videos in more detail,

01:43.540 --> 01:48.600
but for now let's just say it's a process to advance, organize, predict, and test our

01:48.600 --> 01:51.100
knowledge about the universe.

01:51.100 --> 01:55.520
If you understand the current state of scientific knowledge, then you can make better decisions

01:55.520 --> 02:01.420
based on facts and testable ideas rather than outdated belief systems or our intuition

02:01.420 --> 02:06.380
that evolved to protect our ancestors from lions but is no longer suited for the complexity

02:06.380 --> 02:08.580
of our modern world.

02:08.580 --> 02:13.540
Our brains are comically ill-prepared to navigate the fast-moving world we happen to live in

02:13.540 --> 02:17.860
today, a world ironically created by science.

02:17.860 --> 02:22.180
A few hundred years ago, it was possible to be knowledgeable at an expert level in pretty

02:22.180 --> 02:24.500
much every field of study.

02:24.500 --> 02:31.260
In the information age, this is a futile endeavor since knowledge and data are increasing exponentially.

02:31.260 --> 02:36.180
So to even have a chance of grasping the world we live in, we need summaries that give us,

02:36.180 --> 02:40.620
if not a true understanding of all the details, a solid overview.

02:40.620 --> 02:45.320
Explaining science to many people is not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary for

02:45.320 --> 02:48.220
the progress of our species at large.

02:48.220 --> 02:52.520
To make this possible, we need to find metaphors and stories that capture the true nature of

02:52.560 --> 02:57.280
things as much as possible while using a language that our brains can deal with.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.560
A great example here is physics.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.160
Quarks are often depicted as blue, red, and green with different spins.

03:05.160 --> 03:10.680
But just saying spin and using colors forces our brain to imagine colorful spinning balls,

03:10.680 --> 03:15.300
which is great to visualize the different types and the relationships between quarks

03:15.300 --> 03:20.040
but also creates a very wrong image of reality in our heads.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.940
Examples are nothing like the neat diagrams that we're taught in school, but buzzing

03:23.940 --> 03:28.980
and vibrating entities held together by something we call charge that describes how certain

03:28.980 --> 03:33.520
things want to be close or escape each other for some unknown reason.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.600
We're describing phenomena that we're pretty sure exist in some form or another because

03:37.600 --> 03:42.440
the maths works out and we can do real-world experiments and predict their results before

03:42.440 --> 03:43.940
we do them.

03:43.940 --> 03:50.000
In reality, these are models, tricks to summarize what we know, make up a coherent story, and

03:50.000 --> 03:53.600
prepare the ground for more in-depth explanations.

03:53.600 --> 03:58.760
Don't confuse the description of a thing for the thing itself.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.360
Simplifications like these are not just meant to dumb things down.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.000
They're actually useful for experts themselves.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.620
For example, chemists who use wrong electron shell models to work out chemical bonds or

04:09.620 --> 04:14.560
scientists using simplified models as the basis for discussion with colleagues across

04:14.560 --> 04:17.320
different scientific fields.

04:17.400 --> 04:22.240
The simplification of science can also be problematic for a bunch of reasons.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.400
Finding the true nature of reality is super hard because our brains did not evolve for

04:26.400 --> 04:30.640
this job and the universe doesn't care if we understand it.

04:30.640 --> 04:36.560
Science is a process to work towards gaining knowledge and not an absolute truth generator.

04:36.560 --> 04:41.920
The answers it provides are multi-layered and nuanced, and that complexity can get lost

04:41.920 --> 04:46.500
when it's simplified, especially when it's done so for headlines.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.420
When interesting cancer study turns into a potential cure, a healthy food becomes the

04:51.420 --> 04:54.280
basis for a new diet.

04:54.280 --> 05:00.060
Such simplifications give a misleading definiteness to science, which goes against its process-like

05:00.060 --> 05:01.200
nature.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.640
When cures don't materialize and diets don't turn out to be magical, we lose confidence

05:06.640 --> 05:12.140
in science and start to think of all science communication as misleading.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.180
Then there's the opposite effect.

05:14.220 --> 05:19.580
If a simplification is too engaging, if the story it tells is too good, it can distort

05:19.580 --> 05:24.320
the true complexity of a subject and give you a false sense of security and an illusion

05:24.320 --> 05:25.940
of deep knowledge.

05:25.940 --> 05:30.100
A gut feeling that you understand the science better than you actually do, which can lead

05:30.100 --> 05:36.220
people to ignore actual experts over their dangerous, superficial knowledge and gut feeling.

05:36.220 --> 05:41.580
And this can have negative consequences for all of us, because in the worst case, overconfidence

05:41.580 --> 05:48.020
in your own understanding of science can lead to bad decisions made with confidence.

05:48.020 --> 05:52.740
Just think of the surge of people that confidently disavow vaccines or climate change without

05:52.740 --> 05:55.980
truly understanding the subject matter.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.100
So considering all of this and the fact that we at Kurzgesagt reach millions of people

06:00.100 --> 06:03.060
with our videos, how do we handle this?

06:03.060 --> 06:07.180
Well, it has been a journey, especially the research.

06:07.180 --> 06:11.540
When we started, we just read articles, then moved on to books, peer-reviewed papers, then

06:11.540 --> 06:13.540
to conversations with experts.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.240
We began to collect our sources.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.540
With every step, we realized that we were still not doing enough.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.620
Nowadays, we try to read as many primary sources as possible, talk to multiple experts and

06:24.620 --> 06:29.500
document our simplifications and give further reading in our sources doc.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.460
But this doesn't make our process flawless.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.580
What do you do if experts disagree with each other?

06:35.580 --> 06:40.140
What do you do if you find an amazing fact that perfectly fits a narrative but just can't

06:40.140 --> 06:42.000
find its primary source?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.500
How do you deal with the reality that many scientific results have huge error bars or

06:46.500 --> 06:48.720
maybes attached to them?

06:48.720 --> 06:53.380
How do you handle complex systems that defy easy answers?

06:53.380 --> 06:57.960
In the end, we make 10-minute videos, so we need to make decisions about what details

06:57.960 --> 07:03.860
and explanations can fit, which aspects need to be simplified, and which parts to cut.

07:03.860 --> 07:07.760
There is no single best answer for how to do this, and so we weigh the different options

07:07.760 --> 07:09.760
every single time.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.400
It can be painful for experts to see their fields simplified.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.680
Some are happy with us, while others don't like it.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.240
This is fair, but also impossible to avoid.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.920
We're still trying to improve and want to be transparent about what we're trying to

07:23.920 --> 07:24.920
do.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.640
For example, we're taking part in the Tresca project about science communication to learn

07:29.640 --> 07:30.780
more.

07:30.780 --> 07:34.860
All of this brings us to the purpose of our videos.

07:34.860 --> 07:39.340
The most important thing we want to do with this channel is to inspire you and spark your

07:39.340 --> 07:43.620
curiosity for science and the amazing universe we live in.

07:43.620 --> 07:48.020
Learning often doesn't feel like fun, but with the right story it is one of the best

07:48.020 --> 07:51.220
things, and we hope to provide that to you.

07:51.220 --> 07:55.340
Ultimately, we hope that we light a fire in you that motivates you to read books, pay

07:55.340 --> 07:59.800
more attention at school or university, and just get interested in a scientific field

07:59.800 --> 08:02.340
or two and learn more on your own.

08:02.340 --> 08:07.380
Not because you have to, but because you want to know more about how the world really works.

08:07.420 --> 08:13.280
Because the universe is beautiful, and science is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly.

08:13.280 --> 08:19.280
And we hope that knowing that we have to simplify a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less.

08:19.280 --> 08:25.540
We are trying to build something with Kurzgesagt, and while we're not 100% sure yet what exactly,

08:25.540 --> 08:28.900
hopefully something that gets people to think about their own life and the context they

08:28.900 --> 08:34.620
exist in today, as well as the far future and the potential we all have as a species.

08:34.620 --> 08:40.260
And of course, how big things are, and what happens when we blow stuff up, because it's fun.

08:40.260 --> 08:43.800
Thanks for watching and sharing and supporting us.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.740
We really can't do this without you.

08:46.740 --> 08:53.080
Running a science communication business is a balancing act that we take extremely seriously.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.240
On the one hand, we need to be responsible and look out for the team and be able to grow

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
responsibly.

08:58.240 --> 09:02.160
On the other hand, we have to protect the integrity of our videos.

09:02.160 --> 09:07.200
You are enabling us to stay independent, because while we do things like sponsorships or commercial

09:07.200 --> 09:12.000
work, the majority of our income comes directly from you, the burbs.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.880
Kurzgesagt is fundamentally funded by its community, by you.

09:16.880 --> 09:22.780
Because of you, Kurzgesagt is able to invest as much time in our videos and try to become better.

09:22.780 --> 09:27.600
You get our calendar every year, support us on Patreon, and get your personal birds, watch

09:27.600 --> 09:31.240
our videos without adblock or with YouTube Premium.

09:31.240 --> 09:35.220
Our favorite way to keep the channel running are our sciency products from our shop that

09:35.220 --> 09:38.080
hopefully add additional value to the world.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.460
We love bringing little pieces of knowledge into your home or classroom that inspire you

09:42.460 --> 09:46.940
to learn more about the universe in a little more detail, especially with our carefully

09:46.940 --> 09:49.520
researched infographic posters.

09:49.520 --> 09:54.300
Our latest one teaches you about the night sky, and showcases the stars in our night

09:54.300 --> 09:58.560
sky and their special significance for humanity.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.760
With every purchase, you directly support what we do on this channel.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.640
Please don't feel obligated to do so, though.

10:05.640 --> 10:11.040
Watching and sharing is already helping us out a lot, and we are just grateful that so

10:11.040 --> 10:13.920
many of you care about what we try to do here.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.000
Thank you so, so much.
