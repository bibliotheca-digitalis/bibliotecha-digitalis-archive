0	7380	Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one, because our videos distill
7380	14300	very complex subjects into flashy 10-minute pieces and, unfortunately, reality is, well,
14300	15300	complicated.
15300	20340	The question of how we deal with that is central to what we do on this channel and something
20340	21620	we think about a lot.
31000	35500	What we mean by lying is the concept of lies to children.
35500	40500	The idea that on the path to explaining something complicated, you start off with a little lie,
40500	45540	a useful oversimplification that makes it easier to grasp a concept.
45540	49940	For example, as a kid you learned that the Earth is a sphere orbiting the sun with planet
49940	50940	bodies.
50940	55280	But it's not actually a sphere and the bodies are super different in size and not close
55280	57140	to each other at all.
57140	62700	By beginning at a place of oversimplification, you're building a framework, a foundation,
62700	67960	that you can then build upon and add nuance and complexity later on.
67960	73080	Step by step, you're getting towards the real gist of the complicated subject.
73080	79480	Science communication has to use lies to children to some degree or it turns into science education.
79480	84140	And getting a proper education in all of the scientific fields would take years of intense
84140	86480	study to become fluent in them.
86480	91260	As a species, we have a major interest in summarizing science and its advancements and
91260	95640	educating as many people about it as possible because we all benefit if more people have
95640	98940	a fact-based scientific worldview.
98940	103540	We will discuss what science is and how it works in different videos in more detail,
103540	108600	but for now let's just say it's a process to advance, organize, predict, and test our
108600	111100	knowledge about the universe.
111100	115520	If you understand the current state of scientific knowledge, then you can make better decisions
115520	121420	based on facts and testable ideas rather than outdated belief systems or our intuition
121420	126380	that evolved to protect our ancestors from lions but is no longer suited for the complexity
126380	128580	of our modern world.
128580	133540	Our brains are comically ill-prepared to navigate the fast-moving world we happen to live in
133540	137860	today, a world ironically created by science.
137860	142180	A few hundred years ago, it was possible to be knowledgeable at an expert level in pretty
142180	144500	much every field of study.
144500	151260	In the information age, this is a futile endeavor since knowledge and data are increasing exponentially.
151260	156180	So to even have a chance of grasping the world we live in, we need summaries that give us,
156180	160620	if not a true understanding of all the details, a solid overview.
160620	165320	Explaining science to many people is not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary for
165320	168220	the progress of our species at large.
168220	172520	To make this possible, we need to find metaphors and stories that capture the true nature of
172560	177280	things as much as possible while using a language that our brains can deal with.
177280	180560	A great example here is physics.
180560	185160	Quarks are often depicted as blue, red, and green with different spins.
185160	190680	But just saying spin and using colors forces our brain to imagine colorful spinning balls,
190680	195300	which is great to visualize the different types and the relationships between quarks
195300	200040	but also creates a very wrong image of reality in our heads.
200080	203940	Examples are nothing like the neat diagrams that we're taught in school, but buzzing
203940	208980	and vibrating entities held together by something we call charge that describes how certain
208980	213520	things want to be close or escape each other for some unknown reason.
213520	217600	We're describing phenomena that we're pretty sure exist in some form or another because
217600	222440	the maths works out and we can do real-world experiments and predict their results before
222440	223940	we do them.
223940	230000	In reality, these are models, tricks to summarize what we know, make up a coherent story, and
230000	233600	prepare the ground for more in-depth explanations.
233600	238760	Don't confuse the description of a thing for the thing itself.
238760	241360	Simplifications like these are not just meant to dumb things down.
241360	244000	They're actually useful for experts themselves.
244000	249620	For example, chemists who use wrong electron shell models to work out chemical bonds or
249620	254560	scientists using simplified models as the basis for discussion with colleagues across
254560	257320	different scientific fields.
257400	262240	The simplification of science can also be problematic for a bunch of reasons.
262240	266400	Finding the true nature of reality is super hard because our brains did not evolve for
266400	270640	this job and the universe doesn't care if we understand it.
270640	276560	Science is a process to work towards gaining knowledge and not an absolute truth generator.
276560	281920	The answers it provides are multi-layered and nuanced, and that complexity can get lost
281920	286500	when it's simplified, especially when it's done so for headlines.
286500	291420	When interesting cancer study turns into a potential cure, a healthy food becomes the
291420	294280	basis for a new diet.
294280	300060	Such simplifications give a misleading definiteness to science, which goes against its process-like
300060	301200	nature.
301200	306640	When cures don't materialize and diets don't turn out to be magical, we lose confidence
306640	312140	in science and start to think of all science communication as misleading.
312140	314180	Then there's the opposite effect.
314220	319580	If a simplification is too engaging, if the story it tells is too good, it can distort
319580	324320	the true complexity of a subject and give you a false sense of security and an illusion
324320	325940	of deep knowledge.
325940	330100	A gut feeling that you understand the science better than you actually do, which can lead
330100	336220	people to ignore actual experts over their dangerous, superficial knowledge and gut feeling.
336220	341580	And this can have negative consequences for all of us, because in the worst case, overconfidence
341580	348020	in your own understanding of science can lead to bad decisions made with confidence.
348020	352740	Just think of the surge of people that confidently disavow vaccines or climate change without
352740	355980	truly understanding the subject matter.
355980	360100	So considering all of this and the fact that we at Kurzgesagt reach millions of people
360100	363060	with our videos, how do we handle this?
363060	367180	Well, it has been a journey, especially the research.
367180	371540	When we started, we just read articles, then moved on to books, peer-reviewed papers, then
371540	373540	to conversations with experts.
373540	376240	We began to collect our sources.
376240	379540	With every step, we realized that we were still not doing enough.
379540	384620	Nowadays, we try to read as many primary sources as possible, talk to multiple experts and
384620	389500	document our simplifications and give further reading in our sources doc.
389500	392460	But this doesn't make our process flawless.
392460	395580	What do you do if experts disagree with each other?
395580	400140	What do you do if you find an amazing fact that perfectly fits a narrative but just can't
400140	402000	find its primary source?
402000	406500	How do you deal with the reality that many scientific results have huge error bars or
406500	408720	maybes attached to them?
408720	413380	How do you handle complex systems that defy easy answers?
413380	417960	In the end, we make 10-minute videos, so we need to make decisions about what details
417960	423860	and explanations can fit, which aspects need to be simplified, and which parts to cut.
423860	427760	There is no single best answer for how to do this, and so we weigh the different options
427760	429760	every single time.
429760	433400	It can be painful for experts to see their fields simplified.
433400	436680	Some are happy with us, while others don't like it.
436680	440240	This is fair, but also impossible to avoid.
440240	443920	We're still trying to improve and want to be transparent about what we're trying to
443920	444920	do.
444920	449640	For example, we're taking part in the Tresca project about science communication to learn
449640	450780	more.
450780	454860	All of this brings us to the purpose of our videos.
454860	459340	The most important thing we want to do with this channel is to inspire you and spark your
459340	463620	curiosity for science and the amazing universe we live in.
463620	468020	Learning often doesn't feel like fun, but with the right story it is one of the best
468020	471220	things, and we hope to provide that to you.
471220	475340	Ultimately, we hope that we light a fire in you that motivates you to read books, pay
475340	479800	more attention at school or university, and just get interested in a scientific field
479800	482340	or two and learn more on your own.
482340	487380	Not because you have to, but because you want to know more about how the world really works.
487420	493280	Because the universe is beautiful, and science is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly.
493280	499280	And we hope that knowing that we have to simplify a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less.
499280	505540	We are trying to build something with Kurzgesagt, and while we're not 100% sure yet what exactly,
505540	508900	hopefully something that gets people to think about their own life and the context they
508900	514620	exist in today, as well as the far future and the potential we all have as a species.
514620	520260	And of course, how big things are, and what happens when we blow stuff up, because it's fun.
520260	523800	Thanks for watching and sharing and supporting us.
523800	526740	We really can't do this without you.
526740	533080	Running a science communication business is a balancing act that we take extremely seriously.
533080	537240	On the one hand, we need to be responsible and look out for the team and be able to grow
537240	538240	responsibly.
538240	542160	On the other hand, we have to protect the integrity of our videos.
542160	547200	You are enabling us to stay independent, because while we do things like sponsorships or commercial
547200	552000	work, the majority of our income comes directly from you, the burbs.
552000	556880	Kurzgesagt is fundamentally funded by its community, by you.
556880	562780	Because of you, Kurzgesagt is able to invest as much time in our videos and try to become better.
562780	567600	You get our calendar every year, support us on Patreon, and get your personal birds, watch
567600	571240	our videos without adblock or with YouTube Premium.
571240	575220	Our favorite way to keep the channel running are our sciency products from our shop that
575220	578080	hopefully add additional value to the world.
578080	582460	We love bringing little pieces of knowledge into your home or classroom that inspire you
582460	586940	to learn more about the universe in a little more detail, especially with our carefully
586940	589520	researched infographic posters.
589520	594300	Our latest one teaches you about the night sky, and showcases the stars in our night
594300	598560	sky and their special significance for humanity.
598560	602760	With every purchase, you directly support what we do on this channel.
602760	605640	Please don't feel obligated to do so, though.
605640	611040	Watching and sharing is already helping us out a lot, and we are just grateful that so
611040	613920	many of you care about what we try to do here.
613920	616000	Thank you so, so much.
