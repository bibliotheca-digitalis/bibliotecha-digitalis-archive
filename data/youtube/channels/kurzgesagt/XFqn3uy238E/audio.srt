1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
Kurzgesagt is lying to you, in every video, even in this one, because our videos distill

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,300
very complex subjects into flashy 10-minute pieces and, unfortunately, reality is, well,

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,300
complicated.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,340
The question of how we deal with that is central to what we do on this channel and something

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,620
we think about a lot.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,500
What we mean by lying is the concept of lies to children.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,500
The idea that on the path to explaining something complicated, you start off with a little lie,

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,540
a useful oversimplification that makes it easier to grasp a concept.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,940
For example, as a kid you learned that the Earth is a sphere orbiting the sun with planet

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
bodies.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,280
But it's not actually a sphere and the bodies are super different in size and not close

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,140
to each other at all.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,700
By beginning at a place of oversimplification, you're building a framework, a foundation,

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,960
that you can then build upon and add nuance and complexity later on.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,080
Step by step, you're getting towards the real gist of the complicated subject.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,480
Science communication has to use lies to children to some degree or it turns into science education.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,140
And getting a proper education in all of the scientific fields would take years of intense

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,480
study to become fluent in them.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,260
As a species, we have a major interest in summarizing science and its advancements and

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,640
educating as many people about it as possible because we all benefit if more people have

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,940
a fact-based scientific worldview.

22
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,540
We will discuss what science is and how it works in different videos in more detail,

23
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,600
but for now let's just say it's a process to advance, organize, predict, and test our

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,100
knowledge about the universe.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,520
If you understand the current state of scientific knowledge, then you can make better decisions

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,420
based on facts and testable ideas rather than outdated belief systems or our intuition

27
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,380
that evolved to protect our ancestors from lions but is no longer suited for the complexity

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,580
of our modern world.

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,540
Our brains are comically ill-prepared to navigate the fast-moving world we happen to live in

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,860
today, a world ironically created by science.

31
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,180
A few hundred years ago, it was possible to be knowledgeable at an expert level in pretty

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,500
much every field of study.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,260
In the information age, this is a futile endeavor since knowledge and data are increasing exponentially.

34
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,180
So to even have a chance of grasping the world we live in, we need summaries that give us,

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,620
if not a true understanding of all the details, a solid overview.

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,320
Explaining science to many people is not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary for

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,220
the progress of our species at large.

38
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,520
To make this possible, we need to find metaphors and stories that capture the true nature of

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
things as much as possible while using a language that our brains can deal with.

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
A great example here is physics.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Quarks are often depicted as blue, red, and green with different spins.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,680
But just saying spin and using colors forces our brain to imagine colorful spinning balls,

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,300
which is great to visualize the different types and the relationships between quarks

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,040
but also creates a very wrong image of reality in our heads.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,940
Examples are nothing like the neat diagrams that we're taught in school, but buzzing

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,980
and vibrating entities held together by something we call charge that describes how certain

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,520
things want to be close or escape each other for some unknown reason.

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
We're describing phenomena that we're pretty sure exist in some form or another because

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,440
the maths works out and we can do real-world experiments and predict their results before

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,940
we do them.

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:50,000
In reality, these are models, tricks to summarize what we know, make up a coherent story, and

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
prepare the ground for more in-depth explanations.

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,760
Don't confuse the description of a thing for the thing itself.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,360
Simplifications like these are not just meant to dumb things down.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
They're actually useful for experts themselves.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,620
For example, chemists who use wrong electron shell models to work out chemical bonds or

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,560
scientists using simplified models as the basis for discussion with colleagues across

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,320
different scientific fields.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,240
The simplification of science can also be problematic for a bunch of reasons.

60
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
Finding the true nature of reality is super hard because our brains did not evolve for

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,640
this job and the universe doesn't care if we understand it.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,560
Science is a process to work towards gaining knowledge and not an absolute truth generator.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,920
The answers it provides are multi-layered and nuanced, and that complexity can get lost

64
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,500
when it's simplified, especially when it's done so for headlines.

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,420
When interesting cancer study turns into a potential cure, a healthy food becomes the

66
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,280
basis for a new diet.

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,060
Such simplifications give a misleading definiteness to science, which goes against its process-like

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,200
nature.

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,640
When cures don't materialize and diets don't turn out to be magical, we lose confidence

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,140
in science and start to think of all science communication as misleading.

71
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,180
Then there's the opposite effect.

72
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,580
If a simplification is too engaging, if the story it tells is too good, it can distort

73
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,320
the true complexity of a subject and give you a false sense of security and an illusion

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,940
of deep knowledge.

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,100
A gut feeling that you understand the science better than you actually do, which can lead

76
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,220
people to ignore actual experts over their dangerous, superficial knowledge and gut feeling.

77
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,580
And this can have negative consequences for all of us, because in the worst case, overconfidence

78
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,020
in your own understanding of science can lead to bad decisions made with confidence.

79
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,740
Just think of the surge of people that confidently disavow vaccines or climate change without

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,980
truly understanding the subject matter.

81
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,100
So considering all of this and the fact that we at Kurzgesagt reach millions of people

82
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,060
with our videos, how do we handle this?

83
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,180
Well, it has been a journey, especially the research.

84
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,540
When we started, we just read articles, then moved on to books, peer-reviewed papers, then

85
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
to conversations with experts.

86
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,240
We began to collect our sources.

87
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,540
With every step, we realized that we were still not doing enough.

88
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,620
Nowadays, we try to read as many primary sources as possible, talk to multiple experts and

89
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,500
document our simplifications and give further reading in our sources doc.

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,460
But this doesn't make our process flawless.

91
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,580
What do you do if experts disagree with each other?

92
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,140
What do you do if you find an amazing fact that perfectly fits a narrative but just can't

93
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,000
find its primary source?

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,500
How do you deal with the reality that many scientific results have huge error bars or

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,720
maybes attached to them?

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,380
How do you handle complex systems that defy easy answers?

97
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,960
In the end, we make 10-minute videos, so we need to make decisions about what details

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,860
and explanations can fit, which aspects need to be simplified, and which parts to cut.

99
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,760
There is no single best answer for how to do this, and so we weigh the different options

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
every single time.

101
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,400
It can be painful for experts to see their fields simplified.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,680
Some are happy with us, while others don't like it.

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,240
This is fair, but also impossible to avoid.

104
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,920
We're still trying to improve and want to be transparent about what we're trying to

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
do.

106
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,640
For example, we're taking part in the Tresca project about science communication to learn

107
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,780
more.

108
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,860
All of this brings us to the purpose of our videos.

109
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,340
The most important thing we want to do with this channel is to inspire you and spark your

110
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,620
curiosity for science and the amazing universe we live in.

111
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,020
Learning often doesn't feel like fun, but with the right story it is one of the best

112
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,220
things, and we hope to provide that to you.

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,340
Ultimately, we hope that we light a fire in you that motivates you to read books, pay

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,800
more attention at school or university, and just get interested in a scientific field

115
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,340
or two and learn more on your own.

116
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,380
Not because you have to, but because you want to know more about how the world really works.

117
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,280
Because the universe is beautiful, and science is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,280
And we hope that knowing that we have to simplify a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less.

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,540
We are trying to build something with Kurzgesagt, and while we're not 100% sure yet what exactly,

120
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,900
hopefully something that gets people to think about their own life and the context they

121
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,620
exist in today, as well as the far future and the potential we all have as a species.

122
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,260
And of course, how big things are, and what happens when we blow stuff up, because it's fun.

123
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,800
Thanks for watching and sharing and supporting us.

124
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,740
We really can't do this without you.

125
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,080
Running a science communication business is a balancing act that we take extremely seriously.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,240
On the one hand, we need to be responsible and look out for the team and be able to grow

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
responsibly.

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
On the other hand, we have to protect the integrity of our videos.

129
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,200
You are enabling us to stay independent, because while we do things like sponsorships or commercial

130
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,000
work, the majority of our income comes directly from you, the burbs.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Kurzgesagt is fundamentally funded by its community, by you.

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,780
Because of you, Kurzgesagt is able to invest as much time in our videos and try to become better.

133
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,600
You get our calendar every year, support us on Patreon, and get your personal birds, watch

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
our videos without adblock or with YouTube Premium.

135
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,220
Our favorite way to keep the channel running are our sciency products from our shop that

136
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,080
hopefully add additional value to the world.

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,460
We love bringing little pieces of knowledge into your home or classroom that inspire you

138
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,940
to learn more about the universe in a little more detail, especially with our carefully

139
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,520
researched infographic posters.

140
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,300
Our latest one teaches you about the night sky, and showcases the stars in our night

141
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,560
sky and their special significance for humanity.

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,760
With every purchase, you directly support what we do on this channel.

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Please don't feel obligated to do so, though.

144
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,040
Watching and sharing is already helping us out a lot, and we are just grateful that so

145
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
many of you care about what we try to do here.

146
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
Thank you so, so much.
