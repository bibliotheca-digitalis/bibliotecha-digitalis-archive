00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
What would happen if we designated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean?

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than the dark grave of the Titanic.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
A great place for our nuclear test.

00:59.000 --> 01:08.000
We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb, or Tsar Bomba.

01:08.000 --> 01:18.000
Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once that they could boil away an entire lake.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Let's pull the trigger.

01:43.000 --> 01:52.000
In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history.

01:58.000 --> 02:08.000
The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to 10 kilometers the second after it's detonated,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
But the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench is enormous.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
With 11 kilometers of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when, oddly enough, it starts to shrink.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands until the water turns it back, recompressing it.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
The tug-of-war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
the bubble shrinking and growing until eventually the bubble loses for good.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud,

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
as it disintegrates into many smaller hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Just a small wave and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
where it collects and then rains down again.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines, the worst of it probably happens over the oceans.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right?

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
The explosion would vaporize a part of the sea floor and turn a lot of sand into glass,

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries,

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
and earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happen a few times a year,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
without triggering any sort of apocalypse.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different?

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
The planet is too big. It doesn't care.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So, what happens to us if we detonate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Pretty much nothing.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner?

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
More than 1,000 people have got their own bird.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
It helps us explain things, clowns around in the background, or dies a horrible and avoidable death.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
If you want your own bird too and you want it to appear in one of our videos,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
you can get it at patreon.com slash Kurzgesagt.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Patreon is one of the main ways we sustain ourselves,

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
so on top of getting a super nice avatar, you also help us make more and better videos.
