0	9000	What would happen if we designated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean?
9000	18000	For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter.
18000	24000	Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost.
24000	29000	Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench.
29000	36000	The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain.
36000	43000	It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than the dark grave of the Titanic.
43000	47000	It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore.
47000	55000	Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans.
56000	59000	A great place for our nuclear test.
59000	68000	We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb, or Tsar Bomba.
68000	78000	Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky.
78000	86000	Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble.
86000	94000	Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once that they could boil away an entire lake.
94000	100000	And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens.
100000	102000	Let's pull the trigger.
103000	112000	In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT.
112000	118000	A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history.
118000	128000	The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish.
128000	133000	The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it.
133000	138000	The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way,
138000	143000	sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world.
143000	148000	And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops.
148000	154000	On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to 10 kilometers the second after it's detonated,
154000	158000	as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back.
158000	162000	But the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench is enormous.
162000	170000	With 11 kilometers of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction.
170000	178000	Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when, oddly enough, it starts to shrink.
178000	185000	The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands until the water turns it back, recompressing it.
185000	190000	The tug-of-war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times,
190000	194000	the bubble shrinking and growing until eventually the bubble loses for good.
194000	199000	The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up.
199000	203000	It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud,
203000	208000	as it disintegrates into many smaller hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards.
208000	214000	And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing.
214000	219000	Just a small wave and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific.
219000	227000	No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time.
228000	232000	The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days,
232000	236000	although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere,
236000	239000	where it collects and then rains down again.
239000	245000	Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines, the worst of it probably happens over the oceans.
245000	251000	But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right?
252000	259000	Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not.
259000	264000	The explosion would vaporize a part of the sea floor and turn a lot of sand into glass,
264000	268000	but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves.
268000	272000	Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries,
272000	277000	and earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happen a few times a year,
277000	280000	without triggering any sort of apocalypse.
280000	282000	But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit.
282000	288000	Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected.
288000	293000	Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years,
293000	297000	and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different?
297000	303000	The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature.
303000	306000	The planet is too big. It doesn't care.
306000	311000	So, what happens to us if we detonate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean?
311000	313000	Pretty much nothing.
315000	319000	Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner?
319000	323000	More than 1,000 people have got their own bird.
323000	330000	It helps us explain things, clowns around in the background, or dies a horrible and avoidable death.
331000	335000	If you want your own bird too and you want it to appear in one of our videos,
335000	339000	you can get it at patreon.com slash Kurzgesagt.
340000	343000	Patreon is one of the main ways we sustain ourselves,
343000	349000	so on top of getting a super nice avatar, you also help us make more and better videos.
