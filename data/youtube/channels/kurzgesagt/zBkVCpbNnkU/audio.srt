1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Vaccines are celebrated for their part in fighting disease.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,500
But a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger our health instead of protecting it.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,500
The internet is full of stories about allergic reactions, the onset of disabilities, and even death following vaccination appointments.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
And it's true, vaccines can have side effects.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Let's look at how they work, and how dangerous they really are.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells, soldiers, intelligence cells, and weapons factories.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Every day you're attacked countless times, but your immune soldiers alone usually deal with that, so you don't even notice.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If an infection becomes serious though, our intelligence cells gather intel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You know the weapon, antibodies.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're like targeted missiles, produced specifically to combat the invader.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Unfortunately, this process takes several days to complete.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That gives intruders a lot of time to do damage.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Contrary to popular wisdom, what doesn't kill you, doesn't make you stronger.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Bodies really don't want to fight serious wars over and over, so our immune system came up with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time.

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,500
If we fight an enemy that is dangerous enough to trigger our heavy weapons, our immune system automatically creates memory cells.

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Memory cells remain in our body for years in a deep sleep.

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,500
They do nothing but remember.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If we fight an enemy attacks for a second time, the slumbering memory cells awaken and order coordinated attacks and the production of antibodies.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is so fast and effective that many infections you beat once will never make you sick again.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You might even be immune against them forever, which is also why little kids are constantly ill.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They don't have enough memory cells yet.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And this beautiful natural mechanism is what we build on when we use vaccines.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How vaccines work

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As great as memory cells are, obtaining them through an infection is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Vaccines are a way of tricking our bodies into making memory cells and becoming immune to a disease.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They pretend to be a dangerous infection.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One way of doing this is to inject invaders that can't do harm.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For example, by killing them or by ripping them into pieces.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Many systems deal with these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Sometimes it's necessary to make our immune system work harder, though, to produce even more memory cells.

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Live vaccines are the real deal.

32
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
An enemy that can punch back is a bigger challenge than a dead one.

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
But this also sounds like a sort of horrible idea.

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
What if the germs win?

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,500
To avoid that, we breed a sort of weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Just powerful enough to annoy the immune system and create enough memory cells.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so these are the basic principles of vaccine use.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune against very dangerous diseases.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year,

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but most vaccines protect us for years or even a lifetime.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But there's a catch.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Like everything in life, vaccines have another side.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Side effects.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,500
What are they, and what happens if your child develops one?

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The risks of vaccines.

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,500
It's complicated to directly compare the side effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
For example, hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated against measles in the West,

48
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
but there were only 83,000 cases in Europe in 2018.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,500
So with numbers that different, even mild side effects can seem scary

50
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,000
compared to the bad effects of a disease that we don't see as much anymore.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963,

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
virtually every single child on Earth contracted measles at some point.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Every single year.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But are measles really that dangerous in the year 2019

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,500
with our advanced healthcare and new technologies?

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's do a thought experiment based on real numbers.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Imagine a developed country in a parallel world.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
It has good healthcare, but people stop vaccinating.

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
In this scenario, let's say 10 million children caught measles.

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
What happens?

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,000
2,800,000 or 98% will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Up to 800,000 of them or 8% will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,500
700,000 or 7% will suffer from an ear infection which can lead to permanent hearing loss.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,000
600,000 kids or 6% will suffer from pneumonia, the most dangerous effect of measles.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,500
It alone will kill 12,000 children.

68
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will get encephalitis.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,500
2,500 kids or 0.025% will contract SSPE,

70
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,000
a disease where the measles virus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Taken together, around 2.5 million children will suffer from somewhat serious effects from measles.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And about 20,000 children will be killed by measles.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Doesn't stop here though.

74
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,000
The kids who beat measles are left with a severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Time for other diseases to do further damage.

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really bad time for about two weeks.

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Okay, but what about vaccines?

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
It's only fair to look at these risks too.

79
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
So let's repeat our thought experiment.

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,000
But this time, we vaccinate 10 million children with MMR.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,500
What would theoretically happen here?

82
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,000
After being vaccinated, of our 10 million kids, around 10% get a fever.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
500,000 or 5% will get a mild rash.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Up to 100 or 0.001% might have a serious allergic reaction and will have to be treated.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Up to 10 boys or 0.0001% might get inflammation of the genitalia.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,500
And up to 10 kids in total or 0.0001% might get the most serious side effect, encephalitis.

87
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
So we vaccinated 10 million kids.

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
In total, around 120 had side effects that were somewhat serious.

89
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Thanks to good medical treatment in developed regions, almost all of them will be fine.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What about autism?

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,500
The connection of autism and vaccines stems from one source that has been disproven countless times.

92
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,000
We'll link to further reading and videos in the description.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But in 2019, it's fair to say that vaccines do not cause autism.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Alright, but what about deaths?

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's really hard to say if even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated kids would die.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We really did look hard and talk to a lot of different experts.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,500
If we ignore self-reporting, we could only come up with a tiny handful of documented cases

98
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,000
for all the hundreds of millions of children who received the MMR vaccine since 1971.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Measles are many, many thousands of times more dangerous for your child

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,500
than even the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,500
You have to search for lethal vaccine side effects with a huge magnifying glass

102
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,000
and even then it's very hard to find confirmed cases,

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
while deaths from measles are real and easy to find.

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In 2017 alone, 110,000 people died from measles worldwide.

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Statistically, today 300 children will die of measles.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
One since this video started.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can compare vaccines to seatbelts.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Are there weird freak accidents where someone gets killed by their seatbelt?

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, yes.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,500
But do you personally think it's safer to not put a seatbelt on your kid?

111
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait a second, what if your kid is actually allergic?

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,500
What if none of the things we've said applies to your specific situation?

113
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,000
In this case, you need to become the greatest vaccination promoter of all.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Because if your children can't be vaccinated, only the collective can protect them.

115
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,500
This is called herd immunity and it's the only thing that can protect your unvaccinated child.

116
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Herd immunity means that enough people are immune to a disease

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,500
that it can't spread and dies before it reaches its victims.

118
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
But to accomplish this for measles alone,

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
95% of the people around you need to be vaccinated.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,500
The problem with the debate about vaccines is that it's not fought on a level playing field.

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,000
While the pro-vaccine side argues with studies and statistics,

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the arguments against them are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling, anecdotes and misinformation.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And feelings are often immune to facts.

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
We'll not convince anybody by screaming at them,

125
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,500
but we can't hide from the reality of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do.

126
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,000
They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And the biggest side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,500
to eradicate the monsters that most of us have already forgotten.

132
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's not bring the beasts back.
