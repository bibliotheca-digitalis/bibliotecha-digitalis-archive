0	4500	Vaccines are celebrated for their part in fighting disease.
4500	10500	But a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger our health instead of protecting it.
10500	18500	The internet is full of stories about allergic reactions, the onset of disabilities, and even death following vaccination appointments.
18500	22500	And it's true, vaccines can have side effects.
22500	26500	Let's look at how they work, and how dangerous they really are.
30000	45500	Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells, soldiers, intelligence cells, and weapons factories.
45500	53500	Every day you're attacked countless times, but your immune soldiers alone usually deal with that, so you don't even notice.
54000	62000	If an infection becomes serious though, our intelligence cells gather intel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories.
62000	65000	You know the weapon, antibodies.
65000	70000	They're like targeted missiles, produced specifically to combat the invader.
70000	74000	Unfortunately, this process takes several days to complete.
74000	78000	That gives intruders a lot of time to do damage.
78000	83000	Contrary to popular wisdom, what doesn't kill you, doesn't make you stronger.
83000	92500	Bodies really don't want to fight serious wars over and over, so our immune system came up with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time.
92500	100500	If we fight an enemy that is dangerous enough to trigger our heavy weapons, our immune system automatically creates memory cells.
100500	104500	Memory cells remain in our body for years in a deep sleep.
104500	108500	They do nothing but remember.
109000	117000	If we fight an enemy attacks for a second time, the slumbering memory cells awaken and order coordinated attacks and the production of antibodies.
117000	123000	This is so fast and effective that many infections you beat once will never make you sick again.
123000	129000	You might even be immune against them forever, which is also why little kids are constantly ill.
129000	132000	They don't have enough memory cells yet.
132000	138000	And this beautiful natural mechanism is what we build on when we use vaccines.
139000	142000	How vaccines work
142000	149000	As great as memory cells are, obtaining them through an infection is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.
149000	155000	Vaccines are a way of tricking our bodies into making memory cells and becoming immune to a disease.
155000	158000	They pretend to be a dangerous infection.
158000	162000	One way of doing this is to inject invaders that can't do harm.
162000	166000	For example, by killing them or by ripping them into pieces.
166500	170500	Many systems deal with these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.
170500	177500	Sometimes it's necessary to make our immune system work harder, though, to produce even more memory cells.
177500	180500	Live vaccines are the real deal.
180500	184500	An enemy that can punch back is a bigger challenge than a dead one.
184500	187500	But this also sounds like a sort of horrible idea.
187500	189500	What if the germs win?
189500	194500	To avoid that, we breed a sort of weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.
194500	199000	Just powerful enough to annoy the immune system and create enough memory cells.
199000	204000	Okay, so these are the basic principles of vaccine use.
204000	210000	They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune against very dangerous diseases.
210000	216000	Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year,
216000	220000	but most vaccines protect us for years or even a lifetime.
220000	223000	But there's a catch.
223000	226500	Like everything in life, vaccines have another side.
226500	228500	Side effects.
228500	232500	What are they, and what happens if your child develops one?
232500	235500	The risks of vaccines.
235500	241500	It's complicated to directly compare the side effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.
241500	246500	For example, hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated against measles in the West,
246500	250500	but there were only 83,000 cases in Europe in 2018.
251000	255500	So with numbers that different, even mild side effects can seem scary
255500	260000	compared to the bad effects of a disease that we don't see as much anymore.
260000	264000	Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963,
264000	269000	virtually every single child on Earth contracted measles at some point.
269000	274000	An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s.
274000	276000	Every single year.
276000	280000	But are measles really that dangerous in the year 2019
280000	283500	with our advanced healthcare and new technologies?
283500	287500	Are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?
287500	291000	Let's do a thought experiment based on real numbers.
291000	294500	Imagine a developed country in a parallel world.
294500	298500	It has good healthcare, but people stop vaccinating.
298500	302500	In this scenario, let's say 10 million children caught measles.
302500	304500	What happens?
304500	311000	2,800,000 or 98% will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.
311000	316500	Up to 800,000 of them or 8% will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.
316500	323500	700,000 or 7% will suffer from an ear infection which can lead to permanent hearing loss.
323500	330000	600,000 kids or 6% will suffer from pneumonia, the most dangerous effect of measles.
330000	333500	It alone will kill 12,000 children.
333500	339000	Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will get encephalitis.
339000	344500	2,500 kids or 0.025% will contract SSPE,
344500	350000	a disease where the measles virus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later.
350000	357000	Taken together, around 2.5 million children will suffer from somewhat serious effects from measles.
357000	362000	And about 20,000 children will be killed by measles.
362000	363500	Doesn't stop here though.
363500	370000	The kids who beat measles are left with a severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate.
370000	373500	Time for other diseases to do further damage.
373500	380500	Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really bad time for about two weeks.
380500	383500	Okay, but what about vaccines?
383500	386500	It's only fair to look at these risks too.
386500	388500	So let's repeat our thought experiment.
388500	393000	But this time, we vaccinate 10 million children with MMR.
393000	395500	What would theoretically happen here?
395500	401000	After being vaccinated, of our 10 million kids, around 10% get a fever.
401000	405000	500,000 or 5% will get a mild rash.
405000	413000	Up to 100 or 0.001% might have a serious allergic reaction and will have to be treated.
413000	420000	Up to 10 boys or 0.0001% might get inflammation of the genitalia.
420000	428500	And up to 10 kids in total or 0.0001% might get the most serious side effect, encephalitis.
428500	431500	So we vaccinated 10 million kids.
431500	436500	In total, around 120 had side effects that were somewhat serious.
436500	442000	Thanks to good medical treatment in developed regions, almost all of them will be fine.
442000	444000	What about autism?
444000	451500	The connection of autism and vaccines stems from one source that has been disproven countless times.
451500	455000	We'll link to further reading and videos in the description.
455000	461000	But in 2019, it's fair to say that vaccines do not cause autism.
461000	464000	Alright, but what about deaths?
464000	470000	It's really hard to say if even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated kids would die.
470000	474000	We really did look hard and talk to a lot of different experts.
474000	479500	If we ignore self-reporting, we could only come up with a tiny handful of documented cases
479500	486000	for all the hundreds of millions of children who received the MMR vaccine since 1971.
486000	491000	Measles are many, many thousands of times more dangerous for your child
491000	495500	than even the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects.
496000	500500	You have to search for lethal vaccine side effects with a huge magnifying glass
500500	504000	and even then it's very hard to find confirmed cases,
504000	509000	while deaths from measles are real and easy to find.
509000	515000	In 2017 alone, 110,000 people died from measles worldwide.
515000	519000	Statistically, today 300 children will die of measles.
519000	522000	One since this video started.
522000	525000	You can compare vaccines to seatbelts.
525000	529000	Are there weird freak accidents where someone gets killed by their seatbelt?
529000	531000	Well, yes.
531000	535500	But do you personally think it's safer to not put a seatbelt on your kid?
535500	539000	Wait a second, what if your kid is actually allergic?
539000	543500	What if none of the things we've said applies to your specific situation?
543500	549000	In this case, you need to become the greatest vaccination promoter of all.
549000	554500	Because if your children can't be vaccinated, only the collective can protect them.
554500	560500	This is called herd immunity and it's the only thing that can protect your unvaccinated child.
560500	564000	Herd immunity means that enough people are immune to a disease
564000	568500	that it can't spread and dies before it reaches its victims.
568500	571000	But to accomplish this for measles alone,
571000	576000	95% of the people around you need to be vaccinated.
578000	583500	The problem with the debate about vaccines is that it's not fought on a level playing field.
583500	587000	While the pro-vaccine side argues with studies and statistics,
587000	593000	the arguments against them are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling, anecdotes and misinformation.
593000	597000	And feelings are often immune to facts.
597000	599500	We'll not convince anybody by screaming at them,
599500	604500	but we can't hide from the reality of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do.
604500	608000	They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.
608000	612000	They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.
612000	616000	They bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction.
616000	621000	And the biggest side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children.
621000	624000	Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have
624000	628500	to eradicate the monsters that most of us have already forgotten.
628500	632000	Let's not bring the beasts back.
