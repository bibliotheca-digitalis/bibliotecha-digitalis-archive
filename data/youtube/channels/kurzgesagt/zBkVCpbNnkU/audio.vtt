00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
Vaccines are celebrated for their part in fighting disease.

00:04.500 --> 00:10.500
But a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger our health instead of protecting it.

00:10.500 --> 00:18.500
The internet is full of stories about allergic reactions, the onset of disabilities, and even death following vaccination appointments.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.500
And it's true, vaccines can have side effects.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.500
Let's look at how they work, and how dangerous they really are.

00:30.000 --> 00:45.500
Your immune system is a complex army of billions of cells, soldiers, intelligence cells, and weapons factories.

00:45.500 --> 00:53.500
Every day you're attacked countless times, but your immune soldiers alone usually deal with that, so you don't even notice.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
If an infection becomes serious though, our intelligence cells gather intel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
You know the weapon, antibodies.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
They're like targeted missiles, produced specifically to combat the invader.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Unfortunately, this process takes several days to complete.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
That gives intruders a lot of time to do damage.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Contrary to popular wisdom, what doesn't kill you, doesn't make you stronger.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.500
Bodies really don't want to fight serious wars over and over, so our immune system came up with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time.

01:32.500 --> 01:40.500
If we fight an enemy that is dangerous enough to trigger our heavy weapons, our immune system automatically creates memory cells.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.500
Memory cells remain in our body for years in a deep sleep.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.500
They do nothing but remember.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
If we fight an enemy attacks for a second time, the slumbering memory cells awaken and order coordinated attacks and the production of antibodies.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
This is so fast and effective that many infections you beat once will never make you sick again.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
You might even be immune against them forever, which is also why little kids are constantly ill.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
They don't have enough memory cells yet.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
And this beautiful natural mechanism is what we build on when we use vaccines.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
How vaccines work

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
As great as memory cells are, obtaining them through an infection is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Vaccines are a way of tricking our bodies into making memory cells and becoming immune to a disease.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
They pretend to be a dangerous infection.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
One way of doing this is to inject invaders that can't do harm.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
For example, by killing them or by ripping them into pieces.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.500
Many systems deal with these kinds of vaccines pretty easily.

02:50.500 --> 02:57.500
Sometimes it's necessary to make our immune system work harder, though, to produce even more memory cells.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.500
Live vaccines are the real deal.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.500
An enemy that can punch back is a bigger challenge than a dead one.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.500
But this also sounds like a sort of horrible idea.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.500
What if the germs win?

03:09.500 --> 03:14.500
To avoid that, we breed a sort of weak cousin of the real germ in the lab.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.000
Just powerful enough to annoy the immune system and create enough memory cells.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay, so these are the basic principles of vaccine use.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune against very dangerous diseases.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
but most vaccines protect us for years or even a lifetime.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
But there's a catch.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.500
Like everything in life, vaccines have another side.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.500
Side effects.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.500
What are they, and what happens if your child develops one?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.500
The risks of vaccines.

03:55.500 --> 04:01.500
It's complicated to directly compare the side effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.500
For example, hundreds of millions of people are vaccinated against measles in the West,

04:06.500 --> 04:10.500
but there were only 83,000 cases in Europe in 2018.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.500
So with numbers that different, even mild side effects can seem scary

04:15.500 --> 04:20.000
compared to the bad effects of a disease that we don't see as much anymore.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Before the measles vaccine became available in 1963,

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
virtually every single child on Earth contracted measles at some point.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Every single year.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
But are measles really that dangerous in the year 2019

04:40.000 --> 04:43.500
with our advanced healthcare and new technologies?

04:43.500 --> 04:47.500
Are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects?

04:47.500 --> 04:51.000
Let's do a thought experiment based on real numbers.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.500
Imagine a developed country in a parallel world.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.500
It has good healthcare, but people stop vaccinating.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.500
In this scenario, let's say 10 million children caught measles.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
What happens?

05:04.500 --> 05:11.000
2,800,000 or 98% will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.500
Up to 800,000 of them or 8% will suffer from dangerous diarrhea.

05:16.500 --> 05:23.500
700,000 or 7% will suffer from an ear infection which can lead to permanent hearing loss.

05:23.500 --> 05:30.000
600,000 kids or 6% will suffer from pneumonia, the most dangerous effect of measles.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.500
It alone will kill 12,000 children.

05:33.500 --> 05:39.000
Up to 10,000 children or 0.1% will get encephalitis.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.500
2,500 kids or 0.025% will contract SSPE,

05:44.500 --> 05:50.000
a disease where the measles virus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
Taken together, around 2.5 million children will suffer from somewhat serious effects from measles.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
And about 20,000 children will be killed by measles.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.500
Doesn't stop here though.

06:03.500 --> 06:10.000
The kids who beat measles are left with a severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.500
Time for other diseases to do further damage.

06:13.500 --> 06:20.500
Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really bad time for about two weeks.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.500
Okay, but what about vaccines?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
It's only fair to look at these risks too.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
So let's repeat our thought experiment.

06:28.500 --> 06:33.000
But this time, we vaccinate 10 million children with MMR.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.500
What would theoretically happen here?

06:35.500 --> 06:41.000
After being vaccinated, of our 10 million kids, around 10% get a fever.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
500,000 or 5% will get a mild rash.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
Up to 100 or 0.001% might have a serious allergic reaction and will have to be treated.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Up to 10 boys or 0.0001% might get inflammation of the genitalia.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.500
And up to 10 kids in total or 0.0001% might get the most serious side effect, encephalitis.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.500
So we vaccinated 10 million kids.

07:11.500 --> 07:16.500
In total, around 120 had side effects that were somewhat serious.

07:16.500 --> 07:22.000
Thanks to good medical treatment in developed regions, almost all of them will be fine.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
What about autism?

07:24.000 --> 07:31.500
The connection of autism and vaccines stems from one source that has been disproven countless times.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.000
We'll link to further reading and videos in the description.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
But in 2019, it's fair to say that vaccines do not cause autism.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Alright, but what about deaths?

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
It's really hard to say if even a single one of our 10 million vaccinated kids would die.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
We really did look hard and talk to a lot of different experts.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.500
If we ignore self-reporting, we could only come up with a tiny handful of documented cases

07:59.500 --> 08:06.000
for all the hundreds of millions of children who received the MMR vaccine since 1971.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Measles are many, many thousands of times more dangerous for your child

08:11.000 --> 08:15.500
than even the absolute worst case of vaccine side effects.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.500
You have to search for lethal vaccine side effects with a huge magnifying glass

08:20.500 --> 08:24.000
and even then it's very hard to find confirmed cases,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
while deaths from measles are real and easy to find.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
In 2017 alone, 110,000 people died from measles worldwide.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Statistically, today 300 children will die of measles.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
One since this video started.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
You can compare vaccines to seatbelts.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Are there weird freak accidents where someone gets killed by their seatbelt?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Well, yes.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.500
But do you personally think it's safer to not put a seatbelt on your kid?

08:55.500 --> 08:59.000
Wait a second, what if your kid is actually allergic?

08:59.000 --> 09:03.500
What if none of the things we've said applies to your specific situation?

09:03.500 --> 09:09.000
In this case, you need to become the greatest vaccination promoter of all.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.500
Because if your children can't be vaccinated, only the collective can protect them.

09:14.500 --> 09:20.500
This is called herd immunity and it's the only thing that can protect your unvaccinated child.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.000
Herd immunity means that enough people are immune to a disease

09:24.000 --> 09:28.500
that it can't spread and dies before it reaches its victims.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.000
But to accomplish this for measles alone,

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
95% of the people around you need to be vaccinated.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.500
The problem with the debate about vaccines is that it's not fought on a level playing field.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.000
While the pro-vaccine side argues with studies and statistics,

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
the arguments against them are usually a wild mixture of gut feeling, anecdotes and misinformation.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
And feelings are often immune to facts.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.500
We'll not convince anybody by screaming at them,

09:59.500 --> 10:04.500
but we can't hide from the reality of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.000
They kill babies too young to be vaccinated.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
They kill healthy children that are just unlucky.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
They bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And the biggest side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools we have

10:24.000 --> 10:28.500
to eradicate the monsters that most of us have already forgotten.

10:28.500 --> 10:32.000
Let's not bring the beasts back.
