You can order it now until we sell out and then never again.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.340
In the last few years we've looked back at the achievements of our ancestors that

00:14.340 --> 00:18.560
paved the way for our modern world more than 10,000 years ago.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.220
This year we'll turn our gaze to the future of humanity and how we will explore space

00:23.220 --> 00:25.360
in the next 10,000 years.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.720
Twelve illustrations will take you to the liquid gas oceans on Titan, colonies on Mars,

00:30.720 --> 00:36.280
the storm clouds on Uranus, and many more stops on humanity's biggest journey yet.

00:36.280 --> 00:42.360
Enjoy solar system-wide delivery, shipping from the US and finally also from Europe.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.160
we've put together a few deals.
