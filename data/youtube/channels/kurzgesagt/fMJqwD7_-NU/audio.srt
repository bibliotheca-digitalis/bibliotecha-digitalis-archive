1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Come in and have a look at this top-secret project we've been working on.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,040
It's finally time to push the button and put the mighty shrink laser to the test.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm ready.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,000
Right under our noses there's so much hidden that we never get to see with our own eyes,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,360
entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,360
What a magical place this is, a forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,620
work together and form fungus-like structures.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,880
But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any longer.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,640
Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,520
Don't disturb them in their death-like slumber.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,760
Ugh, didn't mean to get in the way.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,680
Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads of proteins.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,480
This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,480
There's way too much going on, better move on.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,600
The structure of a microchip is so small it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,940
Wait, something's happening.

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,060
These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,100
This time, you can join us on a journey through the microcosm.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,700
With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you didn't know existed right

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,620
beneath your feet.

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,420
You know the drill by now, as always it's a super high-quality calendar, very shiny

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,940
and only available for a short time.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,060
We also have a few special deals for you in our shop.

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,140
The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can take home with you.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,600
And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly supports

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,280
what we do here at Kurzgesagt.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,060
And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity all around the world.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,100
So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for space, nature

31
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
and life in people everywhere.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,140
Thank you so much for making this possible.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,500
Have a wonderful 12,023.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,540
See you down in January.
