0	5040	Come in and have a look at this top-secret project we've been working on.
5040	11040	It's finally time to push the button and put the mighty shrink laser to the test.
11040	19560	I'm ready.
19560	24000	Right under our noses there's so much hidden that we never get to see with our own eyes,
24000	29360	entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.
29360	34360	What a magical place this is, a forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that
34360	37620	work together and form fungus-like structures.
37620	40880	But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any longer.
40880	45640	Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades.
45640	48520	Don't disturb them in their death-like slumber.
48520	52600	Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough.
52600	55760	Ugh, didn't mean to get in the way.
55760	60680	Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads of proteins.
60680	64480	This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down.
64480	68480	There's way too much going on, better move on.
68480	72720	Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video.
72720	78600	The structure of a microchip is so small it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm.
78600	82940	Wait, something's happening.
82940	89060	These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar.
89060	93100	This time, you can join us on a journey through the microcosm.
93100	97700	With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you didn't know existed right
97700	99620	beneath your feet.
99620	105420	You know the drill by now, as always it's a super high-quality calendar, very shiny
105420	107940	and only available for a short time.
107940	111060	We also have a few special deals for you in our shop.
111060	115140	The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can take home with you.
115140	119600	And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly supports
119600	122280	what we do here at Kurzgesagt.
122280	127060	And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity all around the world.
127060	132100	So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for space, nature
132100	134300	and life in people everywhere.
134300	137140	Thank you so much for making this possible.
137140	140500	Have a wonderful 12,023.
140500	141540	See you down in January.
