00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Come in and have a look at this top-secret project we've been working on.

00:05.040 --> 00:11.040
It's finally time to push the button and put the mighty shrink laser to the test.

00:11.040 --> 00:19.560
I'm ready.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.000
Right under our noses there's so much hidden that we never get to see with our own eyes,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.360
entire realms of bizarre structures and outlandish creatures.

00:29.360 --> 00:34.360
What a magical place this is, a forest of slime molds, single-celled organisms that

00:34.360 --> 00:37.620
work together and form fungus-like structures.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.880
But we don't have time to hang out with these calm fellows any longer.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.640
Shh, now we're in the kingdom of the mighty tardigrades.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.520
Don't disturb them in their death-like slumber.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.600
Don't worry though, they'll wake up once the conditions are less rough.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.760
Ugh, didn't mean to get in the way.

00:55.760 --> 01:00.680
Your cells are hustling to keep you alive, coordinating myriads of proteins.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.480
This might be the weirdest place yet, with no up or down.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.480
There's way too much going on, better move on.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.720
Now we're inside one of the parts that allow you to watch this video.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.600
The structure of a microchip is so small it nearly breaks the rules of the quantum realm.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.940
Wait, something's happening.

01:22.940 --> 01:29.060
These hidden worlds are all part of our 12,023 human-era calendar.

01:29.060 --> 01:33.100
This time, you can join us on a journey through the microcosm.

01:33.100 --> 01:37.700
With each turn of the page, you will reveal a new world you didn't know existed right

01:37.700 --> 01:39.620
beneath your feet.

01:39.620 --> 01:45.420
You know the drill by now, as always it's a super high-quality calendar, very shiny

01:45.420 --> 01:47.940
and only available for a short time.

01:47.940 --> 01:51.060
We also have a few special deals for you in our shop.

01:51.060 --> 01:55.140
The calendar is a true piece of Kurzgesagt you can take home with you.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.600
And we say this every year, but it's true, every calendar purchase directly supports

01:59.600 --> 02:02.280
what we do here at Kurzgesagt.

02:02.280 --> 02:07.060
And that's not just creating videos, but sparking curiosity all around the world.

02:07.060 --> 02:12.100
So because of you, we can spread knowledge and ignite an appreciation for space, nature

02:12.100 --> 02:14.300
and life in people everywhere.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.140
Thank you so much for making this possible.

02:17.140 --> 02:20.500
Have a wonderful 12,023.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.540
See you down in January.
