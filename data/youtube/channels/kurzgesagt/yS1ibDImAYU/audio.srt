1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Space travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever undertaken.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But in an irony of history, we may stop ourselves from going into space the more we do it.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With every rocket launched and with every satellite deployed,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we're creating a trap for ourselves that gets deadlier and more dangerous every year.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If it's ever activated, it could end the space age and trap us on our planet for decades,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or even centuries.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Getting something into space is incredibly hard.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To do so, you need to move very, very fast, at first straight up to leave the atmosphere,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
then sideways to begin a sort of circling around the Earth, still very, very fast.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you do that successfully, you can enter a low Earth orbit.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And once in orbit, it's very hard to get out of orbit.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Unless you have energy to spare, you're sort of locked in here, falling around the Earth forever.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's great for things we want to stay up, like space stations and satellites.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And so we moved the majority of humanity's space infrastructure to this place,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just high enough so that the atmosphere is so thin that orbiting things can stay up for centuries

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
before air resistance can slow them enough to bring them back to Earth.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But this is also the source of our deadly trap.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Rockets are really metal cylinders that keep big piles of fuel in place.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whenever a portion of the fuel has been spent, the empty tanks are dropped to make the rocket lighter.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Some parts crash down to Earth or burn up in the atmosphere.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But most of the useless rocket parts stay up and begin to orbit the planet.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
After decades of space travel, low Earth orbit is a junkyard of spent boosters,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
broken satellites and millions of pieces of shrapnel from missile tests and explosions.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right now, we know of around 2,600 defunct satellites, 10,000 objects bigger than a monitor,

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
20,000 as large as an apple, 500,000 pieces the size of a marble,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and at least 100 million parts so small they can't be tracked.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This debris is moving at speeds of up to 30,000 kilometers per hour,

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
circling Earth on crisscrossing orbits multiple times a day.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Orbital speeds are so fast that being hit by debris the size of a pea is like being shot by a plasma gun.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
On impact, the debris vaporizes, releasing enough energy to punch holes straight through solid metal.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, we've covered the space around our planet with millions of deadly pieces of destruction.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And we also put a trillion dollar global infrastructure network right in the danger zone.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It performs critical duties essential to the modern world.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Global communication, GPS and navigation, collecting weather data,

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
looking out for asteroids, and all manner of scientific discoveries.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Things we would miss very much if they suddenly went away.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If just one pea-sized bullet hits one of our 1,100 working satellites, it will be destroyed instantly.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Three or four satellites are already being destroyed this way every year.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
As the number of satellites and the amount of junk in orbit is expected to grow tenfold in the next decade,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we're approaching a tipping point.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But the worst thing in space is not tiny pieces of junk.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The worst thing would be an unstoppable chain reaction that turns a lot of non-junk things into junk.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For example, if two satellites hit each other in just the right way.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If satellites collide, they don't stop and fall out of the sky.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's more of a splash than a crash.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Orbital speeds are so fast, solid pieces spray right through each other,

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
transforming the two satellites into clouds of thousands of little things, still fast enough to destroy more satellites.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This could trigger the slowest and most destructive sort of domino effect, a collision cascade.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Like a shotgun spray, each collision creates more bullets.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What was once a single tiny target, very unlikely to hit anything, becomes a wall of destruction, hungry to make more.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As more and more satellites are destroyed, the destruction accelerates exponentially, eventually destroying everything parked in orbit.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But space is very empty, so the first few collisions may take a long time.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
By the time we realize what's happening, it's too late.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
One year, one satellite is destroyed, and that's no big deal.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The next year, five.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The year after, 50, until there's nothing left.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The situation in orbit is rapidly worsening, and we may already be past the point of no return.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Within ten years, space around Earth may no longer be viable for long-term satellites or rockets.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The worst-case scenario is horrifying.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A debris field made of hundreds of millions of pieces, many too small to track, moving at 30,000 kilometers per hour.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It would effectively create a deadly barrier around Earth, possibly too dangerous to cross.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Dreams of moon bases, Mars colonies, or space travel at all may be set back centuries.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And the loss of our space infrastructure would send some of the technology we rely on daily back to the 1970s.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But it might not be too late to clean up our mess.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
While the space industry has become better at avoiding space junk, it's still growing fast and occasional weapon tests don't help.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So there have been a couple of wild but also serious suggestions about how to quickly remove as much deadly space junk as possible without creating more in the process.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Lots of ideas are being thrown around, and some of the most seriously considered involve capture and return missions, which are being tested now.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
One method involves meeting a piece of junk in orbit with a small satellite loaded with a net.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Once caught, a small rocket could be used to bring it down towards Earth.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Targets too large for a net might be instead caught with a harpoon on a tether.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Instead of firing a rocket, the cleaner would deploy a large sail to produce atmospheric drag and accelerate orbital decay.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And there are lots of other wild sci-fi sounding proposals too.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Some might use giant electromagnets.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
These magnetic tugs work by pushing on the magnetic components inside satellites that they use to stabilize and orientate themselves in Earth's magnetic field.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
These may be safer and more reliable than nets and harpoons because they never have to make contact with the junk they're handling, so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up their target into more junk.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
As for the tiniest bits of junk, lasers might be the key to vaporizing them entirely.

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Satellites with lasers wouldn't need to visit their target, they can shoot them from far away.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Large objects can't exactly be shot down, but lasers can be used to ablate them or burn tiny amounts of material off the side to push the junk to a safer orbit.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Whatever technology we use in the end, we better start doing something soon, before 100 million bullets become a trillion and the trap is set.

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If we don't act, our adventure in space might end before it's even begun.

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If our days of dreaming about space exploration might be numbered anyway, we better put them to good use.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
One of the things we most like to spend our time on is learning more about our universe, and to do that, you can just keep watching.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Kurzgesagt and Brilliant are collaborating on a six-part video series about our favorite science and space topics.
