0	7000	Space travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever undertaken.
7000	13000	But in an irony of history, we may stop ourselves from going into space the more we do it.
13000	17000	With every rocket launched and with every satellite deployed,
17000	23000	we're creating a trap for ourselves that gets deadlier and more dangerous every year.
23000	29000	If it's ever activated, it could end the space age and trap us on our planet for decades,
29000	31000	or even centuries.
41000	45000	Getting something into space is incredibly hard.
45000	50000	To do so, you need to move very, very fast, at first straight up to leave the atmosphere,
50000	55000	then sideways to begin a sort of circling around the Earth, still very, very fast.
55000	58000	If you do that successfully, you can enter a low Earth orbit.
58000	62000	And once in orbit, it's very hard to get out of orbit.
62000	68000	Unless you have energy to spare, you're sort of locked in here, falling around the Earth forever.
68000	73000	That's great for things we want to stay up, like space stations and satellites.
73000	77000	And so we moved the majority of humanity's space infrastructure to this place,
77000	80000	just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.
80000	86000	Just high enough so that the atmosphere is so thin that orbiting things can stay up for centuries
86000	90000	before air resistance can slow them enough to bring them back to Earth.
90000	94000	But this is also the source of our deadly trap.
94000	98000	Rockets are really metal cylinders that keep big piles of fuel in place.
98000	104000	Whenever a portion of the fuel has been spent, the empty tanks are dropped to make the rocket lighter.
104000	108000	Some parts crash down to Earth or burn up in the atmosphere.
108000	113000	But most of the useless rocket parts stay up and begin to orbit the planet.
113000	118000	After decades of space travel, low Earth orbit is a junkyard of spent boosters,
118000	124000	broken satellites and millions of pieces of shrapnel from missile tests and explosions.
124000	131000	Right now, we know of around 2,600 defunct satellites, 10,000 objects bigger than a monitor,
131000	136000	20,000 as large as an apple, 500,000 pieces the size of a marble,
136000	141000	and at least 100 million parts so small they can't be tracked.
141000	145000	This debris is moving at speeds of up to 30,000 kilometers per hour,
145000	149000	circling Earth on crisscrossing orbits multiple times a day.
149000	156000	Orbital speeds are so fast that being hit by debris the size of a pea is like being shot by a plasma gun.
156000	162000	On impact, the debris vaporizes, releasing enough energy to punch holes straight through solid metal.
162000	167000	So, we've covered the space around our planet with millions of deadly pieces of destruction.
167000	172000	And we also put a trillion dollar global infrastructure network right in the danger zone.
172000	176000	It performs critical duties essential to the modern world.
176000	182000	Global communication, GPS and navigation, collecting weather data,
182000	187000	looking out for asteroids, and all manner of scientific discoveries.
187000	191000	Things we would miss very much if they suddenly went away.
191000	198000	If just one pea-sized bullet hits one of our 1,100 working satellites, it will be destroyed instantly.
198000	203000	Three or four satellites are already being destroyed this way every year.
203000	209000	As the number of satellites and the amount of junk in orbit is expected to grow tenfold in the next decade,
209000	211000	we're approaching a tipping point.
211000	215000	But the worst thing in space is not tiny pieces of junk.
215000	222000	The worst thing would be an unstoppable chain reaction that turns a lot of non-junk things into junk.
222000	226000	For example, if two satellites hit each other in just the right way.
226000	230000	If satellites collide, they don't stop and fall out of the sky.
230000	233000	It's more of a splash than a crash.
233000	238000	Orbital speeds are so fast, solid pieces spray right through each other,
238000	245000	transforming the two satellites into clouds of thousands of little things, still fast enough to destroy more satellites.
245000	252000	This could trigger the slowest and most destructive sort of domino effect, a collision cascade.
252000	256000	Like a shotgun spray, each collision creates more bullets.
256000	264000	What was once a single tiny target, very unlikely to hit anything, becomes a wall of destruction, hungry to make more.
264000	272000	As more and more satellites are destroyed, the destruction accelerates exponentially, eventually destroying everything parked in orbit.
272000	277000	But space is very empty, so the first few collisions may take a long time.
277000	280000	By the time we realize what's happening, it's too late.
280000	284000	One year, one satellite is destroyed, and that's no big deal.
284000	286000	The next year, five.
286000	291000	The year after, 50, until there's nothing left.
291000	297000	The situation in orbit is rapidly worsening, and we may already be past the point of no return.
297000	303000	Within ten years, space around Earth may no longer be viable for long-term satellites or rockets.
303000	306000	The worst-case scenario is horrifying.
306000	314000	A debris field made of hundreds of millions of pieces, many too small to track, moving at 30,000 kilometers per hour.
314000	320000	It would effectively create a deadly barrier around Earth, possibly too dangerous to cross.
320000	327000	Dreams of moon bases, Mars colonies, or space travel at all may be set back centuries.
327000	334000	And the loss of our space infrastructure would send some of the technology we rely on daily back to the 1970s.
334000	337000	But it might not be too late to clean up our mess.
337000	345000	While the space industry has become better at avoiding space junk, it's still growing fast and occasional weapon tests don't help.
345000	355000	So there have been a couple of wild but also serious suggestions about how to quickly remove as much deadly space junk as possible without creating more in the process.
355000	364000	Lots of ideas are being thrown around, and some of the most seriously considered involve capture and return missions, which are being tested now.
364000	370000	One method involves meeting a piece of junk in orbit with a small satellite loaded with a net.
370000	374000	Once caught, a small rocket could be used to bring it down towards Earth.
374000	379000	Targets too large for a net might be instead caught with a harpoon on a tether.
379000	386000	Instead of firing a rocket, the cleaner would deploy a large sail to produce atmospheric drag and accelerate orbital decay.
386000	390000	And there are lots of other wild sci-fi sounding proposals too.
390000	393000	Some might use giant electromagnets.
393000	403000	These magnetic tugs work by pushing on the magnetic components inside satellites that they use to stabilize and orientate themselves in Earth's magnetic field.
403000	415000	These may be safer and more reliable than nets and harpoons because they never have to make contact with the junk they're handling, so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up their target into more junk.
415000	421000	As for the tiniest bits of junk, lasers might be the key to vaporizing them entirely.
421000	426000	Satellites with lasers wouldn't need to visit their target, they can shoot them from far away.
426000	436000	Large objects can't exactly be shot down, but lasers can be used to ablate them or burn tiny amounts of material off the side to push the junk to a safer orbit.
436000	447000	Whatever technology we use in the end, we better start doing something soon, before 100 million bullets become a trillion and the trap is set.
447000	453000	If we don't act, our adventure in space might end before it's even begun.
456000	461000	If our days of dreaming about space exploration might be numbered anyway, we better put them to good use.
461000	468000	One of the things we most like to spend our time on is learning more about our universe, and to do that, you can just keep watching.
