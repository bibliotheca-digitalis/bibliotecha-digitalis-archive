0	6000	Black holes are the largest collections of pure, violent energy in the universe.
6000	11000	If you come too close, they'll devour you and add your energy to their collection.
11000	14000	And so, the energy is lost to us forever.
14000	15000	Or is it?
15000	18000	It turns out, there's a universe cheat code.
18000	22000	A way of powering civilizations until the very death of everything,
22000	26000	or of constructing the largest bomb in the universe.
26000	27000	But how?
27000	32000	Didn't we learn that all energy is trapped forever in black holes, even light?
32000	33000	This is true.
33000	40000	Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in the universe is about to get weirder for one simple reason.
40000	42000	Black holes are spinning.
52000	54000	Why black holes spin?
57000	63000	When really, really massive stars die, their cores collapse under their own gravity into black holes.
63000	67000	This means something very big becomes very, very tiny.
67000	71000	Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe.
71000	79000	But stars are rotating, and a fundamental property of our universe is that things that are spinning don't want to stop spinning.
79000	81000	We call this angular momentum.
81000	84000	And this angular momentum can't go away.
84000	89000	A big thing that spins and becomes smaller, spins faster.
89000	98000	So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spin faster and faster and faster, until it collapses into a black hole.
98000	102000	And the black hole keeps on spinning, inconceivably fast.
102000	106000	Some of them spin millions of times a second.
107000	110000	Why spinning black holes are special?
110000	119000	Just like non-spinning black holes, spinning black holes have an event horizon and a singularity at their core, where all of their mass is concentrated.
119000	125000	The singularity is usually described as a single, infinitely small point with no surface area.
125000	131000	But points can't rotate, so a rotating singularity can't be a point.
131000	134000	Instead, it's a ringularity.
134000	143000	A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface, spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole.
143000	148000	The black hole is spinning so fast that it morphs space and time itself.
148000	152000	It literally drags space with it, such is its power.
152000	156000	This creates a new and super weird region of space-time.
156000	160000	The ergosphere, which envelops the black hole.
160000	168000	If space and time are completely broken inside the event horizon, then they're only half-broken inside the ergosphere.
168000	171000	Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense.
171000	177000	It's possible to enter it and then leave it again, but it's probably not a great experience.
177000	179000	You can imagine it like this.
179000	183000	Falling into a static black hole is like sliding down a hole.
183000	189000	Being inside the ergosphere of a spinning black hole is like spiraling down a deadly drain.
189000	196000	The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the form of rotation to everything that enters the ergosphere.
196000	200000	The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not.
200000	205000	You need to move faster than the speed of light just to stand still here, which is impossible.
205000	207000	But here's our cheat code.
207000	209000	We can steal this energy.
209000	212000	And there's a lot of energy to steal.
213000	216000	How to steal energy from a monster.
216000	220000	Take the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
220000	227000	We could steal as much energy from it as every single star in the Milky Way emits in a billion years combined.
227000	233000	The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddly enough, to drop something into the black hole.
233000	238000	We've seen that the ringularity forces energy on us when we enter the ergosphere,
238000	243000	which is a lot like being in a whirlpool with space-time rushing around and around.
243000	249000	If you're clever, you can use the water to your advantage and swim faster than before.
249000	255000	In practice, this means sending a rocket into the ergosphere and making a trade with the black hole.
255000	260000	We give it some mass energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy.
260000	264000	But it's not a fair trade. We get the better deal.
264000	270000	Normally, if you fire a rocket, you exchange chemical energy for kinetic energy.
270000	274000	This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool.
274000	280000	But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere, it's like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool.
280000	287000	The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much stronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself.
287000	295000	The boost from the rotation of the black hole is so big that you leave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it.
295000	300000	The black hole gives a tiny amount of its rotational energy to you and slows down a little.
300000	306000	Obviously, this requires a lot of food. Fortunately, black holes aren't picky eaters.
306000	314000	An advanced future civilization would probably harvest asteroids to drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost.
314000	322000	But there's an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and, oddly enough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could ever hope to build.
322000	326000	The black hole bomb.
326000	332000	We only need two things to build a black hole bomb, a fast spinning black hole and a big mirror.
332000	341000	The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole, which is similar to a Dyson sphere, a megastructure that harvests the energy of an entire star.
341000	350000	Although our mirror would be easier to build. Mirrors are simpler, and black holes are much, much more compact than stars.
350000	358000	If we made the mirror 10 centimeters thick, the metal of a big asteroid would probably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our sun.
358000	366000	Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a window and shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole.
366000	372000	You can imagine what happens next by imagining tossing a ball at a wall and it coming back faster than a bullet.
372000	380000	The waves hit the black hole at light speed. A small proportion of the waves falls past the event horizon to disappear forever.
380000	389000	But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere, where the black hole forces some of its rotational energy on them and amplifies them.
389000	398000	They now begin super radiant scattering, which are fancy science words meaning bouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger.
398000	402000	Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger.
402000	408000	By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extract the energy from the waves as fast as they grow,
408000	417000	which we could use in theory to create what would be for all practical purposes an endless source of energy for trillions of years.
417000	428000	Or we could blow it up. If the waves are not released, they will continue to get stronger and stronger and take more and more energy from the black hole until the mirror shatters.
428000	437000	A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova, making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create.
438000	441000	The last home in a dying universe.
441000	448000	The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose process, and the super radiant scattering is that they are not science fiction.
448000	454000	In the far, far future, this might be the only way to survive in our dying universe.
454000	463000	After all the red dwarfs have cooled down and all the white dwarfs transformed into black dwarfs, the universe will turn dark forever.
463000	470000	Rotating black holes might be the only sources of energy in the entire universe that life could harvest.
470000	481000	If so, the last living being in existence might one day end its life around a black hole, which is equally chilling and uplifting.
481000	487000	It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go.
488000	493000	Black holes are as interesting as they are mysterious, but there's actually a surprising amount we do know.
493000	499000	Using maths, we can calculate things and come up with theories about how we die if we fall into them.
499000	504000	If you're the sort of person who gets excited about maths and calculating these things for yourself,
504000	510000	our friends at Brilliant have put together a fantastic black hole quiz to help you get your head around them.
510000	516000	Brilliant is a problem-solving website that teaches you to think like a scientist by guiding you through the problems.
