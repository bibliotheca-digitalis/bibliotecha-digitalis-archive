1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Black holes are the largest collections of pure, violent energy in the universe.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If you come too close, they'll devour you and add your energy to their collection.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And so, the energy is lost to us forever.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Or is it?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It turns out, there's a universe cheat code.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A way of powering civilizations until the very death of everything,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or of constructing the largest bomb in the universe.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But how?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Didn't we learn that all energy is trapped forever in black holes, even light?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This is true.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in the universe is about to get weirder for one simple reason.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Black holes are spinning.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why black holes spin?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When really, really massive stars die, their cores collapse under their own gravity into black holes.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This means something very big becomes very, very tiny.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But stars are rotating, and a fundamental property of our universe is that things that are spinning don't want to stop spinning.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We call this angular momentum.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And this angular momentum can't go away.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A big thing that spins and becomes smaller, spins faster.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spin faster and faster and faster, until it collapses into a black hole.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And the black hole keeps on spinning, inconceivably fast.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Some of them spin millions of times a second.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why spinning black holes are special?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just like non-spinning black holes, spinning black holes have an event horizon and a singularity at their core, where all of their mass is concentrated.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The singularity is usually described as a single, infinitely small point with no surface area.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But points can't rotate, so a rotating singularity can't be a point.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Instead, it's a ringularity.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface, spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The black hole is spinning so fast that it morphs space and time itself.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It literally drags space with it, such is its power.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This creates a new and super weird region of space-time.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The ergosphere, which envelops the black hole.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If space and time are completely broken inside the event horizon, then they're only half-broken inside the ergosphere.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's possible to enter it and then leave it again, but it's probably not a great experience.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can imagine it like this.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Falling into a static black hole is like sliding down a hole.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Being inside the ergosphere of a spinning black hole is like spiraling down a deadly drain.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the form of rotation to everything that enters the ergosphere.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You need to move faster than the speed of light just to stand still here, which is impossible.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But here's our cheat code.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We can steal this energy.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And there's a lot of energy to steal.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How to steal energy from a monster.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Take the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We could steal as much energy from it as every single star in the Milky Way emits in a billion years combined.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddly enough, to drop something into the black hole.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We've seen that the ringularity forces energy on us when we enter the ergosphere,

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
which is a lot like being in a whirlpool with space-time rushing around and around.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you're clever, you can use the water to your advantage and swim faster than before.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In practice, this means sending a rocket into the ergosphere and making a trade with the black hole.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We give it some mass energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But it's not a fair trade. We get the better deal.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Normally, if you fire a rocket, you exchange chemical energy for kinetic energy.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere, it's like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much stronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The boost from the rotation of the black hole is so big that you leave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The black hole gives a tiny amount of its rotational energy to you and slows down a little.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Obviously, this requires a lot of food. Fortunately, black holes aren't picky eaters.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
An advanced future civilization would probably harvest asteroids to drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But there's an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and, oddly enough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could ever hope to build.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The black hole bomb.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We only need two things to build a black hole bomb, a fast spinning black hole and a big mirror.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole, which is similar to a Dyson sphere, a megastructure that harvests the energy of an entire star.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Although our mirror would be easier to build. Mirrors are simpler, and black holes are much, much more compact than stars.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If we made the mirror 10 centimeters thick, the metal of a big asteroid would probably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our sun.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a window and shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can imagine what happens next by imagining tossing a ball at a wall and it coming back faster than a bullet.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The waves hit the black hole at light speed. A small proportion of the waves falls past the event horizon to disappear forever.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere, where the black hole forces some of its rotational energy on them and amplifies them.

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They now begin super radiant scattering, which are fancy science words meaning bouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extract the energy from the waves as fast as they grow,

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
which we could use in theory to create what would be for all practical purposes an endless source of energy for trillions of years.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Or we could blow it up. If the waves are not released, they will continue to get stronger and stronger and take more and more energy from the black hole until the mirror shatters.

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova, making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The last home in a dying universe.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose process, and the super radiant scattering is that they are not science fiction.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In the far, far future, this might be the only way to survive in our dying universe.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
After all the red dwarfs have cooled down and all the white dwarfs transformed into black dwarfs, the universe will turn dark forever.

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Rotating black holes might be the only sources of energy in the entire universe that life could harvest.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If so, the last living being in existence might one day end its life around a black hole, which is equally chilling and uplifting.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Black holes are as interesting as they are mysterious, but there's actually a surprising amount we do know.

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Using maths, we can calculate things and come up with theories about how we die if we fall into them.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you're the sort of person who gets excited about maths and calculating these things for yourself,

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
