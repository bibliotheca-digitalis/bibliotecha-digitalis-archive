00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As the year 12,021 slowly comes to an end, we present to you the 12,022 Human Era Calendar, Eons Edition.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As always, we're adding 10,000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era and include all cultures around the world.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But this year, we're expanding the scope beyond humanity to showcase forgotten animals and plants from all across the Phanerozoic Eon,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half a billion years, surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And of course, pandemics.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In the end, life, er, finds a way.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And we want to celebrate that.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can get the very shiny high-quality limited edition now until we sell out and then never again.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To support what we do on this channel, to fill the void in your soul or just to have something beautiful to look at.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As every year, we also have bundles and special calendar deals with some of your favorite products.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you so much to all of the thousands of burbs who get the calendar every year.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You enable us to create videos and to publish them for free for everyone.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We wish you a happy year, 12,022.
