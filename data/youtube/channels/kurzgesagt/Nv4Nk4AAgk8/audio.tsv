0	12000	As the year 12,021 slowly comes to an end, we present to you the 12,022 Human Era Calendar, Eons Edition.
12000	19000	As always, we're adding 10,000 years to the regular calendar to represent the human era and include all cultures around the world.
19000	27000	But this year, we're expanding the scope beyond humanity to showcase forgotten animals and plants from all across the Phanerozoic Eon,
27000	33000	like giant armored fish, scythe lizards or giant sloths on 12 elaborate pages.
33000	41000	Witness how multicellular life has persisted for over half a billion years, surviving asteroid impacts, volcanoes and frozen oceans.
41000	43000	And of course, pandemics.
43000	46000	In the end, life, er, finds a way.
46000	50000	And we want to celebrate that.
50000	56000	You can get the very shiny high-quality limited edition now until we sell out and then never again.
56000	62000	To support what we do on this channel, to fill the void in your soul or just to have something beautiful to look at.
62000	71000	As every year, we also have bundles and special calendar deals with some of your favorite products.
71000	75000	Thank you so much to all of the thousands of burbs who get the calendar every year.
75000	80000	You enable us to create videos and to publish them for free for everyone.
80000	83000	We wish you a happy year, 12,022.
