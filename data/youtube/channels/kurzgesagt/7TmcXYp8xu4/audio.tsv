960	4480	GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science.
5280	10720	Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin
10720	15440	are widely accepted, the debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture.
16080	19680	Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently?
20640	27040	Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs.
30960	46000	Humans have been genetically modifying plants and animals for thousands of years.
46640	51600	Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields, maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal.
52240	56400	So you did the smart thing and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you.
57360	63760	Traits are just an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced.
65680	70720	After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different
70720	76320	from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a
76320	83040	so-called genetically modified organism, or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping
83040	88800	for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want,
89440	95280	make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So why are people concerned about them?
100320	103280	Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs.
104160	109360	Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new
109360	114320	characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention,
114320	121520	but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could
121520	127840	produce sterile plants requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this,
127840	131680	however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use.
131680	139120	This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been
139120	144000	cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted and traces of modified genes found in foreign
144000	151680	crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves and all crops have to
151680	156720	be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones to keep unintentional
156720	162000	crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally
162000	167280	cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes
167280	173760	from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern
173760	178880	from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible
178880	185040	dangers and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands
185040	190960	of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent.
191680	196160	But don't just take our word for it. Sources for this and other claims are in the video description.
197120	203520	But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene
203520	208560	borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis led to engineered plants produce a protein that
208560	214480	destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide.
215120	221680	Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming. Pesticide sprays can be washed off,
222240	227440	while the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal.
228160	233280	Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species
233280	238480	might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us.
239200	243280	Or take chocolate. It's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans.
244560	249120	BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of
249120	255520	certain insects. It's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that
255520	260960	are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely,
260960	264320	killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop.
265280	271040	Here we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business.
271840	278560	Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result,
278560	284400	the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less
284400	289840	harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means farmers have a strong incentive
289920	294560	to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside.
295360	299840	That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism
299840	304560	of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and the business practice
304560	310320	of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid,
310320	315040	it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model.
316000	320640	GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not an enemy in that fight,
320640	324960	helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment.
330480	335120	Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh,
335120	340720	but often whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides.
341360	345200	Not only was this very expensive, farmers also frequently got sick.
346160	352000	The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked
352000	356880	about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them.
357760	363280	This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improves
363280	368560	and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes a GM approach is the only option.
369440	374640	In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus,
374640	380240	which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified
380240	385280	to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed.
390560	396960	All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now
396960	403680	produce pesticides or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. Scientists
403680	409360	are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients,
410000	414640	like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional
414640	419280	vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants that are more resilient to
419280	424560	climate change. Plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions,
424560	430800	making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's
430800	436160	impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that
436160	442000	can draw nitrogen from the air like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its buildup
442000	447920	pollutes the groundwater and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen
447920	453360	could fix two problems at once. The overuse of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as
453360	458480	the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super
458480	463280	effective carbon collectors like the American chestnut tree to mitigate and actually reverse
463280	468320	climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit.
473440	480400	The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more
480400	486480	by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures,
486480	491520	and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now,
491520	497440	with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it
497440	504320	means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only
504320	509280	drastically change agriculture, but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior.
510240	515600	GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere.
