1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,480
GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,720
Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,440
are widely accepted, the debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently?

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,040
Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:46,000
Humans have been genetically modifying plants and animals for thousands of years.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,600
Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields, maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,400
So you did the smart thing and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,760
Traits are just an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,720
After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,320
from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,040
so-called genetically modified organism, or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,800
for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want,

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,280
make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So why are people concerned about them?

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,360
Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,320
characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention,

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,520
but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,840
produce sterile plants requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this,

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,680
however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use.

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,120
This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,000
cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted and traces of modified genes found in foreign

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,680
crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves and all crops have to

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,720
be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones to keep unintentional

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,000
crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,760
from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,880
from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,040
dangers and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,960
of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,160
But don't just take our word for it. Sources for this and other claims are in the video description.

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,520
But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,560
borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis led to engineered plants produce a protein that

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,480
destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide.

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,680
Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming. Pesticide sprays can be washed off,

36
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,440
while the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal.

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,280
Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us.

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
Or take chocolate. It's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans.

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,120
BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of

41
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,520
certain insects. It's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that

42
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,960
are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely,

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,320
killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop.

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,040
Here we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business.

45
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,560
Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result,

46
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,400
the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,840
harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means farmers have a strong incentive

48
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,560
to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside.

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,840
That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism

50
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,560
of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and the business practice

51
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,320
of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid,

52
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,040
it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,640
GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not an enemy in that fight,

54
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,960
helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment.

55
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,120
Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh,

56
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,720
but often whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides.

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Not only was this very expensive, farmers also frequently got sick.

58
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,000
The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,880
about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them.

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,280
This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improves

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes a GM approach is the only option.

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,640
In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus,

63
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,240
which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified

64
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,280
to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed.

65
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,960
All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now

66
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,680
produce pesticides or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. Scientists

67
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,360
are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients,

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,640
like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional

69
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,280
vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants that are more resilient to

70
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,560
climate change. Plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions,

71
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,800
making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's

72
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,160
impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that

73
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,000
can draw nitrogen from the air like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its buildup

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,920
pollutes the groundwater and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,360
could fix two problems at once. The overuse of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,480
the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super

77
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,280
effective carbon collectors like the American chestnut tree to mitigate and actually reverse

78
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,320
climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit.

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,400
The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more

80
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,480
by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures,

81
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,520
and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now,

82
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,440
with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it

83
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,320
means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only

84
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,280
drastically change agriculture, but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior.

85
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,600
GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere.
