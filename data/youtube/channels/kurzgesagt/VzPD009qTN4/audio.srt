1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Microbes are everywhere, on your phone, in your water bottle, on your hands before you wash them, on your hands after you wash them, and literally everywhere else on top of you too.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Microbes are omnipresent at any moment, and there is nothing we can do about it.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So millions of years ago, we made a pact. We give them shelter and food, and in turn, they work for us.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But the more we learn about this partnership, the more it looks like a cold war.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Inside our mother's womb, humans start out sterile.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When we're born and traveling through the birth canal, billions of our mother's bacteria cover every single part of our bodies.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is an essential part of human health. Children born via C-section have a higher rate of asthma, immune diseases, and even leukemia.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So our bodies do not only accept the invasion of microorganisms, they welcome it.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Over millions of years, we coevolved to make the best of our relationship.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Mother's milk, for example, contains special sugars that are meant to feed and support certain groups of microbes, work as a decoy for others, and help to modulate the immune system.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It takes up to two years until a healthy microbe community has formed.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Every human has their own unique microbiome made up of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We have three categories of guests on and in our bodies.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
One, quiet passengers that do their own thing and are politely ignored.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
By being there, they take up space and keep more aggressive intruders in check.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Two, guests that harm us, but with whom we've learned to live.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
For example, bacteria that literally create acid that melts our teeth if we don't brush enough.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They want to take up as much space as they can, and we don't want them to.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But we can't get rid of them entirely.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Three, friendly fellows that our bodies want to have around.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Most of them are a community of 380,000 billion bacteria from up to 5,000 different species that live in our gut.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
These gut microorganisms help us digest food and pull additional calories from things we can't digest ourselves.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Unfortunately, our gut is also the perfect point of attack for intruders, so it's guarded by an aggressive army, our immune system.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To survive here, our microbiome co-evolved with us to be able to communicate with our body.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The most important part of that is to ask the immune system to not kill them.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But they also have a real motivation to keep our gut healthy, so some of them produce messenger substances that help to educate the immune system,

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and others stimulate the gut cells to regenerate faster.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But over the last few years, evidence has emerged that the influence of our gut microbiome goes much, much further.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It might even talk directly to our brain.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We've observed a few curious things.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
90% of our body's serotonin, an important messenger substance for nerve cells, is produced in the gut.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Some scientists think the microbiome does this to communicate with the vagus nerve, the information highway of our nervous system.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Other examples are bacteria that stimulate immune cells in the gut, so they send a kind of alarm signal to the brain.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Here, it activates immune cells that help the brain recover from injuries.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Since the brain decides when we eat, the microbiome is interested in a healthy brain.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A new field of science is opening up here, and we're just on the verge of understanding how these complex systems inside our bodies interact.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But we are starting to see how much our microbiome actually influences us and our behavior.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Take depression, for example.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Healthy rats fed microbes from the guts of depressed people began showing anxiety-like behavior and symptoms that look like depression.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And in early 2017, a study linked the microbiome to intelligence by connecting a certain setup of bacteria in newborns with better motor and language skills.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But it might also influence our daily lives.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Tests with fruit flies showed that their microbiome influenced what kinds of food they craved.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This could mean your microbes are able to tell your brain which food it should get them, although this is not a one-way street.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The seed for our microbiome comes from our mother, but how it develops and changes is determined by what we eat.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The organisms in our gut feed on different things.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Some like fibers and leafy greens, others go for sugars and starches, and some love greasy fries and butter.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Our gut is like a garden in which we constantly decide what will grow and blossom.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria that like healthy food.

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If we eat a lot of fast food, then we breed fast food-loving bacteria.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Life is hard, so we can get trapped in a vicious circle.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You have a stressful time and eat lots of burgers and fries and pizza.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is awesome for fast food bacteria. They multiply and multiply and take up space from vegetable-loving bacteria.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But even worse, they send signals to the brain to continue what it's doing.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This makes you want more fast food, which breeds more fast food bacteria, which makes you crave fast food, and so on.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This kind of self-reinforcing cycle could play a huge role in obesity.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But it's important to stress that you can fight this process and reverse it by eating healthily and breeding more good bacteria.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Beyond weight gain, our microbiome has also been linked to other serious diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and cancer.

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's is actually gut problems.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If your body is overrun with bacteria that harm you, there is often only one solution.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You bring in an army of good guys.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's very easy. You just transplant some healthy poop.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You do that by literally transferring poop from a healthy person into your gut.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This method is already used to cure diarrhea that's caused when C. difficile bacteria take over a gut microbiome.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But we just don't know enough about the complex interplay at work here yet.

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
For example, a transplant from an overweight donor cured a woman's diarrhea, but contributed to her obesity down the line.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This caused some waves, and another study tried to reverse the effect.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Poop transplants from slim people to obese ones gave them a more diverse microbiome and made them less sensitive to insulin.

68
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Both things that also happen when people lose weight.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We need to do a lot more science to really understand how our microbes make us healthy or sick.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But whether we like it or not, we need our microbiome and it needs us.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We'll never have our bodies to ourselves, but we have gained a powerful ally if we can just keep the peace.
