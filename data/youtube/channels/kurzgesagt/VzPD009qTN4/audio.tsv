0	14000	Microbes are everywhere, on your phone, in your water bottle, on your hands before you wash them, on your hands after you wash them, and literally everywhere else on top of you too.
14000	20000	Microbes are omnipresent at any moment, and there is nothing we can do about it.
20000	28000	So millions of years ago, we made a pact. We give them shelter and food, and in turn, they work for us.
28000	33000	But the more we learn about this partnership, the more it looks like a cold war.
44000	48000	Inside our mother's womb, humans start out sterile.
48000	55000	When we're born and traveling through the birth canal, billions of our mother's bacteria cover every single part of our bodies.
55000	64000	This is an essential part of human health. Children born via C-section have a higher rate of asthma, immune diseases, and even leukemia.
64000	70000	So our bodies do not only accept the invasion of microorganisms, they welcome it.
70000	76000	Over millions of years, we coevolved to make the best of our relationship.
76000	86000	Mother's milk, for example, contains special sugars that are meant to feed and support certain groups of microbes, work as a decoy for others, and help to modulate the immune system.
86000	91000	It takes up to two years until a healthy microbe community has formed.
91000	98000	Every human has their own unique microbiome made up of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms.
98000	103000	We have three categories of guests on and in our bodies.
103000	108000	One, quiet passengers that do their own thing and are politely ignored.
108000	113000	By being there, they take up space and keep more aggressive intruders in check.
113000	118000	Two, guests that harm us, but with whom we've learned to live.
118000	123000	For example, bacteria that literally create acid that melts our teeth if we don't brush enough.
123000	127000	They want to take up as much space as they can, and we don't want them to.
127000	130000	But we can't get rid of them entirely.
130000	134000	Three, friendly fellows that our bodies want to have around.
134000	143000	Most of them are a community of 380,000 billion bacteria from up to 5,000 different species that live in our gut.
143000	150000	These gut microorganisms help us digest food and pull additional calories from things we can't digest ourselves.
150000	158000	Unfortunately, our gut is also the perfect point of attack for intruders, so it's guarded by an aggressive army, our immune system.
158000	164000	To survive here, our microbiome co-evolved with us to be able to communicate with our body.
164000	169000	The most important part of that is to ask the immune system to not kill them.
169000	177000	But they also have a real motivation to keep our gut healthy, so some of them produce messenger substances that help to educate the immune system,
177000	182000	and others stimulate the gut cells to regenerate faster.
182000	189000	But over the last few years, evidence has emerged that the influence of our gut microbiome goes much, much further.
189000	192000	It might even talk directly to our brain.
192000	195000	We've observed a few curious things.
195000	202000	90% of our body's serotonin, an important messenger substance for nerve cells, is produced in the gut.
202000	209000	Some scientists think the microbiome does this to communicate with the vagus nerve, the information highway of our nervous system.
209000	216000	Other examples are bacteria that stimulate immune cells in the gut, so they send a kind of alarm signal to the brain.
216000	220000	Here, it activates immune cells that help the brain recover from injuries.
220000	226000	Since the brain decides when we eat, the microbiome is interested in a healthy brain.
226000	235000	A new field of science is opening up here, and we're just on the verge of understanding how these complex systems inside our bodies interact.
235000	241000	But we are starting to see how much our microbiome actually influences us and our behavior.
241000	243000	Take depression, for example.
243000	252000	Healthy rats fed microbes from the guts of depressed people began showing anxiety-like behavior and symptoms that look like depression.
252000	262000	And in early 2017, a study linked the microbiome to intelligence by connecting a certain setup of bacteria in newborns with better motor and language skills.
262000	265000	But it might also influence our daily lives.
265000	271000	Tests with fruit flies showed that their microbiome influenced what kinds of food they craved.
271000	279000	This could mean your microbes are able to tell your brain which food it should get them, although this is not a one-way street.
279000	286000	The seed for our microbiome comes from our mother, but how it develops and changes is determined by what we eat.
286000	289000	The organisms in our gut feed on different things.
289000	297000	Some like fibers and leafy greens, others go for sugars and starches, and some love greasy fries and butter.
297000	303000	Our gut is like a garden in which we constantly decide what will grow and blossom.
303000	307000	If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria that like healthy food.
307000	313000	If we eat a lot of fast food, then we breed fast food-loving bacteria.
313000	317000	Life is hard, so we can get trapped in a vicious circle.
317000	322000	You have a stressful time and eat lots of burgers and fries and pizza.
322000	329000	This is awesome for fast food bacteria. They multiply and multiply and take up space from vegetable-loving bacteria.
329000	334000	But even worse, they send signals to the brain to continue what it's doing.
334000	342000	This makes you want more fast food, which breeds more fast food bacteria, which makes you crave fast food, and so on.
342000	347000	This kind of self-reinforcing cycle could play a huge role in obesity.
347000	355000	But it's important to stress that you can fight this process and reverse it by eating healthily and breeding more good bacteria.
355000	363000	Beyond weight gain, our microbiome has also been linked to other serious diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and cancer.
363000	367000	One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's is actually gut problems.
367000	373000	If your body is overrun with bacteria that harm you, there is often only one solution.
373000	375000	You bring in an army of good guys.
375000	380000	That's very easy. You just transplant some healthy poop.
380000	385000	You do that by literally transferring poop from a healthy person into your gut.
385000	393000	This method is already used to cure diarrhea that's caused when C. difficile bacteria take over a gut microbiome.
393000	397000	But we just don't know enough about the complex interplay at work here yet.
397000	405000	For example, a transplant from an overweight donor cured a woman's diarrhea, but contributed to her obesity down the line.
405000	409000	This caused some waves, and another study tried to reverse the effect.
409000	417000	Poop transplants from slim people to obese ones gave them a more diverse microbiome and made them less sensitive to insulin.
417000	420000	Both things that also happen when people lose weight.
420000	426000	We need to do a lot more science to really understand how our microbes make us healthy or sick.
426000	432000	But whether we like it or not, we need our microbiome and it needs us.
432000	439000	We'll never have our bodies to ourselves, but we have gained a powerful ally if we can just keep the peace.
