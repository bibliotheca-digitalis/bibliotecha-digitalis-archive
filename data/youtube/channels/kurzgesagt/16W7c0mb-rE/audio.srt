1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And yet, many ants together are smart.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
An ant colony can construct complex structures.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They can wage war or defend themselves.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This phenomenon is called emergence,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that have different properties than the sum of their parts.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And emergence is everywhere.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
like the concept of wetness.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Take wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wetness is an emerging property of water,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And this is sort of it.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Many things interact under a certain set of rules,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
creating something above and beyond themselves.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It turns out that more is different.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This different property is itself a new thing,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
every layer made from more complex parts.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Atoms form molecules, molecules form proteins,

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
proteins make up cells, cells make up organs,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
organs form individuals, individuals form societies.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
By following a rule set that produces order through chaos.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's assume that a colony should have 25% workers,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
25% caretakers, 25% soldiers, and 25% gatherers.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ants communicate their current job via chemicals.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For example, a worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say,

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm a worker.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information,

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
telling each other their job and what they're doing.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Both keep track of who they met in the past.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Many worker ants need to switch jobs,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but how do you tell this to thousands of them?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Simple, you don't.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants,

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and then it changes its job.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The worker becomes a gatherer.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Other ants will do the same, until after a while, there are enough gatherers again.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The balance is restored all by itself.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The actions and interactions of an individual are random.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant,

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but the simple set of rules is so elegant

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
On an even more fundamental level,

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
hundreds of millions of complicated molecules

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure,

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
a being with vastly different properties

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
than the sum of its dead parts emerges.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The smallest unit of life, a cell.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cells combine and cooperate,

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
they specialize and respond to one another,

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and over time, we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
made of trillions of individual stupid things,

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and yet we breathe, digest, and watch YouTube videos.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How do your cells know what to do?

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to collectively create a heartbeat.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Some cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
to see what they're up to and then decide what to do.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task,

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There is no mastermind giving commands,

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
just single units communicating with their neighbors

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and acting according to the feedback they get.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What about our most important part?

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is our consciousness, then, an emergent property of the cells in our brain?

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This question is too big and important.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It deserves a video of its own.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Some things that emerge are hard to define.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It has neither brain, nor face, nor body,

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and yet the colony interacts with the world.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just like colonies emerge from ants,

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
things emerge from humans, like nations.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What actually is a nation?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is it its population?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is it its institutions?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Its symbols like its flag, colors, or anthems?

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The physical things it makes like cities?

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The territory it occupies?

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All of these things are fluid.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Populations change and are replaced.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Institutions come and go.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Cities can be constructed and abandoned.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Orders have changed all the time for most of history.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And symbols get replaced by new symbols.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A nation has no face, no brain, no body.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are nations not real, then?

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course they are.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline,

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and they can stop existing.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But not just nations.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Communities, companies, cities, societies.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We don't know why any of this happens.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We just observe it, and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
