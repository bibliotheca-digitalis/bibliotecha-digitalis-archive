0	6000	An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan.
6000	10000	And yet, many ants together are smart.
10000	14000	An ant colony can construct complex structures.
14000	19000	Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle.
19000	22000	They can wage war or defend themselves.
22000	28000	How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?
28000	31000	This phenomenon is called emergence,
31000	36000	and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.
36000	40000	In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things
40000	44000	that have different properties than the sum of their parts.
44000	48000	Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity.
48000	52000	And emergence is everywhere.
59000	65000	Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up,
65000	67000	like the concept of wetness.
67000	72000	Take wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness.
72000	76000	There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.
76000	79000	Wetness is an emerging property of water,
79000	85000	something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.
85000	87000	And this is sort of it.
87000	90000	Many things interact under a certain set of rules,
90000	93000	creating something above and beyond themselves.
93000	96000	It turns out that more is different.
96000	99000	This different property is itself a new thing,
99000	104000	and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.
104000	107000	You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other,
107000	110000	every layer made from more complex parts.
110000	114000	Atoms form molecules, molecules form proteins,
114000	117000	proteins make up cells, cells make up organs,
117000	122000	organs form individuals, individuals form societies.
122000	125000	But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?
125000	130000	How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony?
130000	134000	By following a rule set that produces order through chaos.
134000	138000	For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.
138000	141000	Let's assume that a colony should have 25% workers,
141000	146000	25% caretakers, 25% soldiers, and 25% gatherers.
146000	149000	Ants communicate their current job via chemicals.
149000	153000	For example, a worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say,
153000	155000	I'm a worker.
155000	159000	When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information,
159000	161000	telling each other their job and what they're doing.
161000	164000	Both keep track of who they met in the past.
164000	168000	Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers.
168000	172000	If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.
172000	175000	Many worker ants need to switch jobs,
175000	177000	but how do you tell this to thousands of them?
177000	180000	Simple, you don't.
180000	183000	Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants,
183000	186000	but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.
186000	190000	It counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point,
190000	193000	and then it changes its job.
193000	195000	The worker becomes a gatherer.
195000	200000	Other ants will do the same, until after a while, there are enough gatherers again.
200000	203000	The balance is restored all by itself.
203000	207000	The actions and interactions of an individual are random.
207000	210000	You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant,
210000	213000	but the simple set of rules is so elegant
213000	217000	that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.
217000	219000	On an even more fundamental level,
219000	222000	hundreds of millions of complicated molecules
222000	226000	interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure,
226000	228000	a being with vastly different properties
228000	231000	than the sum of its dead parts emerges.
231000	234000	The smallest unit of life, a cell.
234000	237000	We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are,
237000	241000	we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.
241000	243000	Cells combine and cooperate,
243000	246000	they specialize and respond to one another,
246000	251000	and over time, we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.
251000	257000	Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system
257000	260000	made of trillions of individual stupid things,
260000	265000	and yet we breathe, digest, and watch YouTube videos.
265000	268000	How do your cells know what to do?
268000	271000	Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.
271000	275000	Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment
275000	278000	to collectively create a heartbeat.
278000	281000	Some cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells
281000	284000	to see what they're up to and then decide what to do.
284000	287000	If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task,
287000	292000	it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them.
292000	294000	There is no mastermind giving commands,
294000	297000	just single units communicating with their neighbors
297000	300000	and acting according to the feedback they get.
300000	303000	What about our most important part?
303000	307000	What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?
307000	312000	Is our consciousness, then, an emergent property of the cells in our brain?
312000	315000	This question is too big and important.
315000	318000	It deserves a video of its own.
318000	321000	Some things that emerge are hard to define.
321000	325000	You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.
325000	328000	It has neither brain, nor face, nor body,
328000	331000	and yet the colony interacts with the world.
331000	334000	Just like colonies emerge from ants,
334000	338000	things emerge from humans, like nations.
338000	340000	What actually is a nation?
340000	342000	Is it its population?
342000	344000	Is it its institutions?
344000	348000	Its symbols like its flag, colors, or anthems?
348000	351000	The physical things it makes like cities?
351000	353000	The territory it occupies?
353000	356000	All of these things are fluid.
356000	358000	Populations change and are replaced.
358000	360000	Institutions come and go.
360000	363000	Cities can be constructed and abandoned.
363000	366000	Orders have changed all the time for most of history.
366000	370000	And symbols get replaced by new symbols.
370000	375000	A nation has no face, no brain, no body.
375000	377000	Are nations not real, then?
377000	378000	Of course they are.
378000	382000	Just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.
382000	386000	They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline,
386000	388000	and they can stop existing.
388000	393000	But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.
393000	395000	But not just nations.
395000	399000	All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.
399000	403000	Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.
403000	408000	Communities, companies, cities, societies.
408000	413000	All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities
413000	416000	than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.
416000	418000	We don't know why any of this happens.
418000	423000	We just observe it, and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.
423000	428000	It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
