00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
And yet, many ants together are smart.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
An ant colony can construct complex structures.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
They can wage war or defend themselves.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
This phenomenon is called emergence,

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
that have different properties than the sum of their parts.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And emergence is everywhere.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
like the concept of wetness.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Take wet fabric. If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Wetness is an emerging property of water,

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And this is sort of it.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Many things interact under a certain set of rules,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
creating something above and beyond themselves.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It turns out that more is different.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
This different property is itself a new thing,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
every layer made from more complex parts.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Atoms form molecules, molecules form proteins,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
proteins make up cells, cells make up organs,

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
organs form individuals, individuals form societies.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
But how can something be more than the sum of its parts?

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
By following a rule set that produces order through chaos.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Let's assume that a colony should have 25% workers,

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
25% caretakers, 25% soldiers, and 25% gatherers.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Ants communicate their current job via chemicals.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
For example, a worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm a worker.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
telling each other their job and what they're doing.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Both keep track of who they met in the past.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Many worker ants need to switch jobs,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
but how do you tell this to thousands of them?

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Simple, you don't.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It counts too few gatherers until it reaches a critical point,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
and then it changes its job.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
The worker becomes a gatherer.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Other ants will do the same, until after a while, there are enough gatherers again.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
The balance is restored all by itself.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
The actions and interactions of an individual are random.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
but the simple set of rules is so elegant

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
On an even more fundamental level,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
hundreds of millions of complicated molecules

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
a being with vastly different properties

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
than the sum of its dead parts emerges.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The smallest unit of life, a cell.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
we just know they emerge from things that are not alive.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Cells combine and cooperate,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
they specialize and respond to one another,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
and over time, we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
made of trillions of individual stupid things,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
and yet we breathe, digest, and watch YouTube videos.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
How do your cells know what to do?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
to collectively create a heartbeat.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Some cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
to see what they're up to and then decide what to do.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
it will start working on that task as well and sync up with them.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
There is no mastermind giving commands,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
just single units communicating with their neighbors

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
and acting according to the feedback they get.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
What about our most important part?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions?

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Is our consciousness, then, an emergent property of the cells in our brain?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
This question is too big and important.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It deserves a video of its own.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Some things that emerge are hard to define.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
It has neither brain, nor face, nor body,

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
and yet the colony interacts with the world.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Just like colonies emerge from ants,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
things emerge from humans, like nations.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
What actually is a nation?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Is it its population?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Is it its institutions?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Its symbols like its flag, colors, or anthems?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
The physical things it makes like cities?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The territory it occupies?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
All of these things are fluid.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Populations change and are replaced.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Institutions come and go.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Cities can be constructed and abandoned.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Orders have changed all the time for most of history.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
And symbols get replaced by new symbols.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
A nation has no face, no brain, no body.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Are nations not real, then?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Of course they are.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and they can stop existing.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
But not just nations.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Communities, companies, cities, societies.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We don't know why any of this happens.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
We just observe it, and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
It may be the most beautiful and wondrous property of our universe.
