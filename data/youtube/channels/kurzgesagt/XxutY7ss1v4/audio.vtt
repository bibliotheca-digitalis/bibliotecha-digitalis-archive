00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Do you think the European Union is worth it, or should we end it?

00:05.440 --> 00:11.360
Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.120
Everything considered, is its existence good or bad for Europeans?

00:17.120 --> 00:29.680
Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU,

00:29.680 --> 00:32.520
we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club.

00:32.520 --> 00:39.200
The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450

00:39.200 --> 00:43.640
million people, making it the third most populous sort of country in the world.

00:43.640 --> 00:49.920
It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world.

00:49.920 --> 00:56.120
But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing, peace.

00:56.120 --> 01:02.360
Europeans are really good at war, so they were embroiled in bloody conflicts for basically all

01:02.360 --> 01:08.480
their history. A century-long rivalry between Germany and France alone cost millions of lives,

01:08.480 --> 01:13.440
and ran so deeply that Germans invented their own word for it, Erbfeinschaft.

01:13.440 --> 01:20.280
After the Second World War, Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace that was not based on

01:20.280 --> 01:25.680
a balance of military power. Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe

01:25.680 --> 01:31.480
should become so closely interconnected that war would become both impractical and unthinkable.

01:31.480 --> 01:37.320
The plan worked. Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace.

01:37.320 --> 01:43.800
Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the European Union's achievements and problems?

01:43.800 --> 01:51.480
Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms. EU treaties and regulations ensure easy

01:51.480 --> 01:57.040
travel, cheap telecommunications, a great variety of goods and services, as well as very strong

01:57.040 --> 02:02.480
health and safety standards. European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such

02:02.480 --> 02:07.960
as Microsoft, Apple, or Facebook about fair competition, tax evasion, or data protection.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.600
Through the EU science programs, the European countries became a collaborative engine that

02:13.600 --> 02:19.080
serves as a hub of science in the wider world. Unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere

02:19.080 --> 02:23.920
makes it easy to apply for funds and set up international teams of experts with the best

02:23.920 --> 02:29.560
equipment. In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms of its global share of science

02:29.560 --> 02:35.600
researchers and produces more than 25% of the world's research output with only 5% of its

02:35.600 --> 02:43.680
population. But many citizens feel distrust towards the EU. Brussels seems far away and

02:43.680 --> 02:50.240
untransparent, technocratic, and difficult to understand. It doesn't help that the EU is

02:50.240 --> 02:56.160
terrible at outreach and explaining what it actually does. This disconnect has also led

02:56.160 --> 03:01.600
to an ever-shrinking voter turnout over the decades. More transparency and accountability

03:01.600 --> 03:07.960
are desperately needed if the EU institutions want the trust of their citizens. Currently,

03:07.960 --> 03:14.360
the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015. Some countries have accepted far greater

03:14.360 --> 03:19.400
numbers of asylum seekers than others, while the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left

03:19.400 --> 03:25.720
alone. Other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration and closed their

03:25.760 --> 03:32.040
borders, effectively shutting down the largest route into Europe. The EU's wealth and freedom

03:32.040 --> 03:38.680
make it an attractive destination, and this is unlikely to change. The population is split on

03:38.680 --> 03:43.920
how to react to that. Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants with a different culture

03:43.920 --> 03:48.920
without strictly demanding integration, while others argue that immigration is not the problem,

03:48.920 --> 03:55.240
but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration. To strike a balance

03:55.280 --> 04:00.040
between helping refugees, turning illegal immigrants away, and successfully integrating

04:00.040 --> 04:04.560
the ones that stay remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the

04:04.560 --> 04:11.280
Union. Immigration aside, many more challenges lie in the future, like defense. Traditionally,

04:11.280 --> 04:17.120
European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the US through NATO. But in the

04:17.120 --> 04:21.680
current political climate, Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United

04:21.680 --> 04:27.560
States for its safety. If combined today, the militaries of EU members could form an effective

04:27.560 --> 04:32.800
defensive force and be the third largest military in the world. That could save a lot of money,

04:32.800 --> 04:38.760
safeguard European borders, and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers from 27 different

04:38.760 --> 04:48.120
countries serving one common purpose. What about money? Well, it's complicated. The EU created the

04:48.120 --> 04:54.560
largest single market in the world. Inside it, you can trade border and customs free. Countries

04:54.560 --> 04:59.760
that entered it got a massive boost to their economies. Even between neighbors, trade increased

04:59.760 --> 05:06.760
by up to 500%. And there was a steady creation of new jobs. Research has suggested that joining the

05:06.760 --> 05:12.440
EU has left most new members with an average of a 12% higher GDP than if they had remained outside.

05:12.760 --> 05:18.800
And for those regions with weaker economies and poor infrastructure, EU institutions provide

05:18.800 --> 05:24.480
billions of euros every year, helping economic investment, infrastructure, and social development.

05:24.480 --> 05:30.720
On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies

05:30.720 --> 05:36.920
and laws regarding labor, taxes, and social security. The cost of one hour of work in an

05:37.080 --> 05:44.480
EU country ranges from 4 euros an hour to 40 euros an hour. Some countries have large industries and

05:44.480 --> 05:50.480
strong exports, while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources. On top of this,

05:50.480 --> 05:57.920
the euro is the common currency of some, but not all of these countries. As the Greek crisis shows,

05:57.920 --> 06:04.840
this can be a recipe for disaster. You cannot unify vastly different economies under one currency,

06:04.840 --> 06:11.480
but leave their economic policies separate. So, should all EU countries unite under the common

06:11.480 --> 06:16.840
currency or not? Should the weakest links be thrown out of the euro, or should countries be

06:16.840 --> 06:22.840
made to adopt common policies on taxes, healthcare, and social security? It's a question that's been

06:22.840 --> 06:30.760
brewing for years and is nowhere near a solution. So, everything briefly considered, is the European

06:30.880 --> 06:38.120
Union worth it? Here is our answer. The EU is very flawed and still needs a lot of work,

06:38.120 --> 06:43.840
but it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world. Put together,

06:43.840 --> 06:48.200
we lead in science, are one of the strongest economic powers, and could have one of the

06:48.200 --> 06:53.800
strongest militaries in the world. But more importantly, the EU gives us peace, security,

06:53.800 --> 07:00.000
and a sense of shared identity. And something we all crave in these turbulent times, stability.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.720
If we want to protect the values we're so proud of, a strong European Union is the best way to

07:05.720 --> 07:12.240
make sure our voice is heard in the world. Alone, as small states, we'll hardly stand a chance in

07:12.240 --> 07:20.600
a world of shifting superpowers. What do you think about the EU and its future? In recent years,

07:20.600 --> 07:26.000
the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real-world consequences.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.160
Let's not do that. If you don't agree with this video, you're not our enemy, you just have a

07:31.160 --> 07:36.480
different opinion and that's fine. We're all in the same boat after all, so let's have a fact-based

07:36.480 --> 07:38.200
discussion about our future.
