0	5440	Do you think the European Union is worth it, or should we end it?
5440	11360	Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements.
11360	17120	Everything considered, is its existence good or bad for Europeans?
17120	29680	Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU,
29680	32520	we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club.
32520	39200	The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450
39200	43640	million people, making it the third most populous sort of country in the world.
43640	49920	It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world.
49920	56120	But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing, peace.
56120	62360	Europeans are really good at war, so they were embroiled in bloody conflicts for basically all
62360	68480	their history. A century-long rivalry between Germany and France alone cost millions of lives,
68480	73440	and ran so deeply that Germans invented their own word for it, Erbfeinschaft.
73440	80280	After the Second World War, Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace that was not based on
80280	85680	a balance of military power. Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe
85680	91480	should become so closely interconnected that war would become both impractical and unthinkable.
91480	97320	The plan worked. Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace.
97320	103800	Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the European Union's achievements and problems?
103800	111480	Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms. EU treaties and regulations ensure easy
111480	117040	travel, cheap telecommunications, a great variety of goods and services, as well as very strong
117040	122480	health and safety standards. European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such
122480	127960	as Microsoft, Apple, or Facebook about fair competition, tax evasion, or data protection.
127960	133600	Through the EU science programs, the European countries became a collaborative engine that
133600	139080	serves as a hub of science in the wider world. Unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere
139080	143920	makes it easy to apply for funds and set up international teams of experts with the best
143920	149560	equipment. In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms of its global share of science
149560	155600	researchers and produces more than 25% of the world's research output with only 5% of its
155600	163680	population. But many citizens feel distrust towards the EU. Brussels seems far away and
163680	170240	untransparent, technocratic, and difficult to understand. It doesn't help that the EU is
170240	176160	terrible at outreach and explaining what it actually does. This disconnect has also led
176160	181600	to an ever-shrinking voter turnout over the decades. More transparency and accountability
181600	187960	are desperately needed if the EU institutions want the trust of their citizens. Currently,
187960	194360	the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015. Some countries have accepted far greater
194360	199400	numbers of asylum seekers than others, while the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left
199400	205720	alone. Other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration and closed their
205760	212040	borders, effectively shutting down the largest route into Europe. The EU's wealth and freedom
212040	218680	make it an attractive destination, and this is unlikely to change. The population is split on
218680	223920	how to react to that. Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants with a different culture
223920	228920	without strictly demanding integration, while others argue that immigration is not the problem,
228920	235240	but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration. To strike a balance
235280	240040	between helping refugees, turning illegal immigrants away, and successfully integrating
240040	244560	the ones that stay remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the
244560	251280	Union. Immigration aside, many more challenges lie in the future, like defense. Traditionally,
251280	257120	European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the US through NATO. But in the
257120	261680	current political climate, Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United
261680	267560	States for its safety. If combined today, the militaries of EU members could form an effective
267560	272800	defensive force and be the third largest military in the world. That could save a lot of money,
272800	278760	safeguard European borders, and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers from 27 different
278760	288120	countries serving one common purpose. What about money? Well, it's complicated. The EU created the
288120	294560	largest single market in the world. Inside it, you can trade border and customs free. Countries
294560	299760	that entered it got a massive boost to their economies. Even between neighbors, trade increased
299760	306760	by up to 500%. And there was a steady creation of new jobs. Research has suggested that joining the
306760	312440	EU has left most new members with an average of a 12% higher GDP than if they had remained outside.
312760	318800	And for those regions with weaker economies and poor infrastructure, EU institutions provide
318800	324480	billions of euros every year, helping economic investment, infrastructure, and social development.
324480	330720	On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies
330720	336920	and laws regarding labor, taxes, and social security. The cost of one hour of work in an
337080	344480	EU country ranges from 4 euros an hour to 40 euros an hour. Some countries have large industries and
344480	350480	strong exports, while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources. On top of this,
350480	357920	the euro is the common currency of some, but not all of these countries. As the Greek crisis shows,
357920	364840	this can be a recipe for disaster. You cannot unify vastly different economies under one currency,
364840	371480	but leave their economic policies separate. So, should all EU countries unite under the common
371480	376840	currency or not? Should the weakest links be thrown out of the euro, or should countries be
376840	382840	made to adopt common policies on taxes, healthcare, and social security? It's a question that's been
382840	390760	brewing for years and is nowhere near a solution. So, everything briefly considered, is the European
390880	398120	Union worth it? Here is our answer. The EU is very flawed and still needs a lot of work,
398120	403840	but it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world. Put together,
403840	408200	we lead in science, are one of the strongest economic powers, and could have one of the
408200	413800	strongest militaries in the world. But more importantly, the EU gives us peace, security,
413800	420000	and a sense of shared identity. And something we all crave in these turbulent times, stability.
420000	425720	If we want to protect the values we're so proud of, a strong European Union is the best way to
425720	432240	make sure our voice is heard in the world. Alone, as small states, we'll hardly stand a chance in
432240	440600	a world of shifting superpowers. What do you think about the EU and its future? In recent years,
440600	446000	the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real-world consequences.
446000	451160	Let's not do that. If you don't agree with this video, you're not our enemy, you just have a
451160	456480	different opinion and that's fine. We're all in the same boat after all, so let's have a fact-based
456480	458200	discussion about our future.
