1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Do you think the European Union is worth it, or should we end it?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,360
Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,120
Everything considered, is its existence good or bad for Europeans?

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:29,680
Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU,

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,520
we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,200
The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,640
million people, making it the third most populous sort of country in the world.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,920
It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,120
But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing, peace.

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,360
Europeans are really good at war, so they were embroiled in bloody conflicts for basically all

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,480
their history. A century-long rivalry between Germany and France alone cost millions of lives,

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,440
and ran so deeply that Germans invented their own word for it, Erbfeinschaft.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,280
After the Second World War, Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace that was not based on

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,680
a balance of military power. Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,480
should become so closely interconnected that war would become both impractical and unthinkable.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,320
The plan worked. Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,800
Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the European Union's achievements and problems?

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms. EU treaties and regulations ensure easy

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,040
travel, cheap telecommunications, a great variety of goods and services, as well as very strong

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,480
health and safety standards. European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,960
as Microsoft, Apple, or Facebook about fair competition, tax evasion, or data protection.

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,600
Through the EU science programs, the European countries became a collaborative engine that

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,080
serves as a hub of science in the wider world. Unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere

24
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,920
makes it easy to apply for funds and set up international teams of experts with the best

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,560
equipment. In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms of its global share of science

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,600
researchers and produces more than 25% of the world's research output with only 5% of its

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,680
population. But many citizens feel distrust towards the EU. Brussels seems far away and

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,240
untransparent, technocratic, and difficult to understand. It doesn't help that the EU is

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,160
terrible at outreach and explaining what it actually does. This disconnect has also led

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,600
to an ever-shrinking voter turnout over the decades. More transparency and accountability

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,960
are desperately needed if the EU institutions want the trust of their citizens. Currently,

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:14,360
the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015. Some countries have accepted far greater

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,400
numbers of asylum seekers than others, while the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,720
alone. Other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration and closed their

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,040
borders, effectively shutting down the largest route into Europe. The EU's wealth and freedom

36
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,680
make it an attractive destination, and this is unlikely to change. The population is split on

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,920
how to react to that. Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants with a different culture

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
without strictly demanding integration, while others argue that immigration is not the problem,

39
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,240
but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration. To strike a balance

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,040
between helping refugees, turning illegal immigrants away, and successfully integrating

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,560
the ones that stay remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Union. Immigration aside, many more challenges lie in the future, like defense. Traditionally,

43
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,120
European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the US through NATO. But in the

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
current political climate, Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,560
States for its safety. If combined today, the militaries of EU members could form an effective

46
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,800
defensive force and be the third largest military in the world. That could save a lot of money,

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,760
safeguard European borders, and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers from 27 different

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:48,120
countries serving one common purpose. What about money? Well, it's complicated. The EU created the

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,560
largest single market in the world. Inside it, you can trade border and customs free. Countries

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,760
that entered it got a massive boost to their economies. Even between neighbors, trade increased

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,760
by up to 500%. And there was a steady creation of new jobs. Research has suggested that joining the

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,440
EU has left most new members with an average of a 12% higher GDP than if they had remained outside.

53
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,800
And for those regions with weaker economies and poor infrastructure, EU institutions provide

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,480
billions of euros every year, helping economic investment, infrastructure, and social development.

55
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,720
On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies

56
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,920
and laws regarding labor, taxes, and social security. The cost of one hour of work in an

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,480
EU country ranges from 4 euros an hour to 40 euros an hour. Some countries have large industries and

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,480
strong exports, while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources. On top of this,

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,920
the euro is the common currency of some, but not all of these countries. As the Greek crisis shows,

60
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,840
this can be a recipe for disaster. You cannot unify vastly different economies under one currency,

61
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,480
but leave their economic policies separate. So, should all EU countries unite under the common

62
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,840
currency or not? Should the weakest links be thrown out of the euro, or should countries be

63
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,840
made to adopt common policies on taxes, healthcare, and social security? It's a question that's been

64
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,760
brewing for years and is nowhere near a solution. So, everything briefly considered, is the European

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,120
Union worth it? Here is our answer. The EU is very flawed and still needs a lot of work,

66
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,840
but it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world. Put together,

67
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,200
we lead in science, are one of the strongest economic powers, and could have one of the

68
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,800
strongest militaries in the world. But more importantly, the EU gives us peace, security,

69
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,000
and a sense of shared identity. And something we all crave in these turbulent times, stability.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,720
If we want to protect the values we're so proud of, a strong European Union is the best way to

71
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,240
make sure our voice is heard in the world. Alone, as small states, we'll hardly stand a chance in

72
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,600
a world of shifting superpowers. What do you think about the EU and its future? In recent years,

73
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,000
the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real-world consequences.

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Let's not do that. If you don't agree with this video, you're not our enemy, you just have a

75
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,480
different opinion and that's fine. We're all in the same boat after all, so let's have a fact-based

76
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
discussion about our future.
