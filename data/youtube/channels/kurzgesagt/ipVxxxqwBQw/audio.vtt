00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the Earth's atmosphere.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
That's 50% more than the year 2000, and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
And it's not just CO2.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
We're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And emissions keep rising.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
But they need to get down to zero.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Almost every year breaks some horrible record.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
But although all countries agree on this goal in principle, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions,

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China, are currently releasing much more CO2.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
while for developing countries, they are survival emissions.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So, who is responsible for climate change and CO2 emissions?

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
And, regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation states.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
Question 1 of 3. Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today?

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO2.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
More than 50% came from Asia.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%,

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
while Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed 8%.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
China is by far the world's largest emitter, with 10 billion tons of CO2 every year, or 27% of global emissions.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
It's followed by the USA with 15%, and the European Union with around 10%.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Together, this is more than half of the world's CO2 emissions.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Next on our list is India at 7%, Russia at 5%, Japan at 3%,

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada, all just short of 2%.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Together with the first three, the top ten are responsible for 75% of global emissions.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
Question 2 of 3, which countries have emitted the most in total?

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
emitting 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20th century.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
In second place is the EU at 22%.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
China comes in third at just under 13%, around half of the USA's contribution.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
India's contribution shrinks to 3%, along with the whole of Africa and South America.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
The UK is responsible for 1% of annual global emissions,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
but takes 5% of the historical responsibility.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Germany, producing 2% of emissions per year today, has contributed almost 6%,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
is hard to defend if facts matter to you.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
population numbers and total emissions.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Question 3 of 3.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
The average human is responsible for around 5 tons of CO2 each year,

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
but averages can be misleading.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
The countries with the largest CO2 emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
In 2017 Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person,

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
But those are outliers.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person, 17 tons a year.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
China may be the world's largest emitter, but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
18.5% of the world population.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Per person, it's above average at 7 tons.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Historically, CO2 emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint because as we move from poor to rich,

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking,

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
cars or planes, smartphones, computers and interact with people across the world online.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
The enormous rise of China's CO2 emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
If we order CO2 emissions by income, we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
and the bottom half for only 14%.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year.

07:15.000 --> 07:25.000
And not only that, the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
The developing world will be hit the hardest.

07:28.000 --> 07:39.000
The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources, harsher and more frequent natural disasters and large climate refugee movements.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Question 4 of 3.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
So who should take responsibility?

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
They have a large historical footprint and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person.

08:00.000 --> 08:11.000
But their countries' annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries because the giant that is China is finally catching up and other giants like India are on their way.

08:11.000 --> 08:22.000
Many Germans, for example, wonder how, if Germany only accounts for 2% of yearly emissions, it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
The answer is simple.

08:24.000 --> 08:35.000
For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces and technology to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel dependent as we are, we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
And we're getting there. The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
But it needs to happen much faster.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change, the rest of the world would follow because it has no choice.

09:04.000 --> 09:14.000
Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology, the rest of the world adopted them too because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the bloc.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility.

09:18.000 --> 09:29.000
China is the largest CO2 emitter today and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time.

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
Climate change is a global problem and no country alone can fix it.

09:41.000 --> 09:51.000
Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems and in a way it's a daft question, but one that has played international politics for decades.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
In the end, it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And right now, we are all not doing that.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But we can begin today.

10:06.000 --> 10:18.000
This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions.
