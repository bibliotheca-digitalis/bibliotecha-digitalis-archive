0	10000	Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, into the Earth's atmosphere.
10000	15000	In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more.
15000	22000	That's 50% more than the year 2000, and almost three times as much as 50 years ago.
23000	25000	And it's not just CO2.
25000	31000	We're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide.
31000	39000	Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year.
39000	42000	And emissions keep rising.
42000	45000	But they need to get down to zero.
46000	50000	In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible.
50000	53000	Almost every year breaks some horrible record.
53000	61000	We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole.
61000	65000	Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record.
65000	72000	The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly.
73000	81000	But although all countries agree on this goal in principle, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load.
81000	85000	The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions,
85000	92000	and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China, are currently releasing much more CO2.
92000	97000	On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions,
97000	101000	while for developing countries, they are survival emissions.
101000	106000	Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint,
106000	110000	and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor.
110000	115000	So, who is responsible for climate change and CO2 emissions?
115000	120000	And, regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today?
120000	124000	In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation states.
124000	128000	We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video.
129000	135000	Question 1 of 3. Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today?
135000	140000	In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO2.
140000	143000	More than 50% came from Asia.
143000	148000	North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%,
148000	154000	while Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed 8%.
154000	162000	China is by far the world's largest emitter, with 10 billion tons of CO2 every year, or 27% of global emissions.
162000	168000	It's followed by the USA with 15%, and the European Union with around 10%.
168000	173000	Together, this is more than half of the world's CO2 emissions.
173000	177000	So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs,
177000	183000	humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change.
183000	189000	Next on our list is India at 7%, Russia at 5%, Japan at 3%,
189000	196000	and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada, all just short of 2%.
196000	203000	Together with the first three, the top ten are responsible for 75% of global emissions.
203000	209000	But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture.
209000	215000	Question 2 of 3, which countries have emitted the most in total?
215000	221000	If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically.
221000	226000	The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot.
226000	231000	The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions,
231000	236000	emitting 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20th century.
236000	240000	In second place is the EU at 22%.
240000	247000	China comes in third at just under 13%, around half of the USA's contribution.
247000	253000	India's contribution shrinks to 3%, along with the whole of Africa and South America.
253000	258000	The UK is responsible for 1% of annual global emissions,
258000	263000	but takes 5% of the historical responsibility.
263000	269000	Germany, producing 2% of emissions per year today, has contributed almost 6%,
269000	273000	as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined.
273000	279000	So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world
279000	283000	is hard to defend if facts matter to you.
283000	289000	But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things,
289000	292000	population numbers and total emissions.
292000	297000	If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher.
297000	303000	Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer.
303000	305000	Question 3 of 3.
305000	310000	Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person?
310000	315000	The average human is responsible for around 5 tons of CO2 each year,
315000	318000	but averages can be misleading.
318000	325000	The countries with the largest CO2 emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers.
325000	331000	In 2017 Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person,
331000	339000	followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
339000	342000	But those are outliers.
342000	348000	Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person, 17 tons a year.
348000	356000	That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons.
356000	362000	The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average.
362000	370000	China may be the world's largest emitter, but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people,
370000	374000	18.5% of the world population.
374000	379000	Per person, it's above average at 7 tons.
379000	384000	Historically, CO2 emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living.
384000	390000	Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint because as we move from poor to rich,
390000	396000	we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking,
396000	402000	cars or planes, smartphones, computers and interact with people across the world online.
402000	410000	The enormous rise of China's CO2 emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history.
410000	418000	If we order CO2 emissions by income, we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions
418000	422000	and the bottom half for only 14%.
422000	427000	The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian.
427000	435000	In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year.
435000	445000	And not only that, the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change.
445000	448000	The developing world will be hit the hardest.
448000	459000	The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources, harsher and more frequent natural disasters and large climate refugee movements.
459000	462000	Question 4 of 3.
462000	465000	So who should take responsibility?
465000	469000	Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position.
469000	474000	They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production.
474000	480000	They have a large historical footprint and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person.
480000	491000	But their countries' annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries because the giant that is China is finally catching up and other giants like India are on their way.
491000	502000	Many Germans, for example, wonder how, if Germany only accounts for 2% of yearly emissions, it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions.
502000	504000	The answer is simple.
504000	515000	For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces and technology to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world.
515000	523000	If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel dependent as we are, we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available.
523000	532000	And we're getting there. The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors.
532000	535000	But it needs to happen much faster.
535000	543000	If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change, the rest of the world would follow because it has no choice.
544000	554000	Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology, the rest of the world adopted them too because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the bloc.
554000	558000	Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility.
558000	569000	China is the largest CO2 emitter today and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time.
569000	576000	Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today.
576000	581000	Climate change is a global problem and no country alone can fix it.
581000	591000	Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems and in a way it's a daft question, but one that has played international politics for decades.
591000	596000	In the end, it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can.
596000	600000	And right now, we are all not doing that.
600000	603000	But we can begin today.
606000	618000	This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions.
