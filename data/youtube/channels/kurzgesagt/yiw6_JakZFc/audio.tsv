0	6000	Never before in human history have we been richer, more advanced, more powerful.
6000	11000	And yet, we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change.
11000	14000	It seems simple on the surface.
14000	18000	Greenhouse gases trap energy from the sun and transfer it to our atmosphere.
18000	21000	This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers.
21000	24000	Dry places become drier and wet places wetter.
24000	30000	Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them.
30000	34000	So why don't we just, like, prevent all of that?
34000	37000	Well, it's complicated.
37000	42000	The public debate about stopping rapid climate change often focuses on a few key features,
42000	45000	like coal plants, cars, or burping cows.
45000	48000	And so the solutions are often simplistic.
48000	53000	Rows of solar panels, biking to work, something-something sustainability.
53000	56000	And a huge talking point is personal responsibility.
56000	61000	How you should change your lifestyle to prevent rapid climate change,
61000	64000	which we'll find out together in the next few minutes.
64000	68000	This is one of those videos where we want to encourage you to watch to the end,
68000	74000	because to discuss real, doable solutions, we first need to understand the problem.
74000	84000	A fuller picture.
84000	92000	Modern industrial society as we constructed it in the last 150 years is inherently destructive to the planet.
92000	100000	Basically, everything we do to make our lives easier, safer, and more comfortable is making things worse for the biosphere.
100000	105000	The food we eat, the streets we walk on, the clothes we wear, the gadgets we use,
105000	110000	the way we move around, and the pleasant temperatures we artificially create around us.
110000	115000	While most people know about the serious impact of energy, beef, cars, and planes,
115000	118000	many major polluters are barely ever talked about.
118000	124000	The emissions leaking out of landfills are as significant as the emissions of all the jets in the air.
124000	129000	More CO2 is released to run our homes than from all cars combined.
129000	135000	And the emissions produced when making a new car is equivalent to building just two meters of road.
135000	142000	So it is nice to switch to electric cars, but they won't solve anything if we keep building roads the same way.
142000	147000	Fixing one small part of the industrial system is not enough.
147000	152000	Each of the many different parts needs its own solution, and many of them aren't straightforward.
153000	160000	But even where we know what to do, just because a solution exists, doesn't mean we're able or willing to implement it.
160000	164000	There are many grey areas in the fight against rapid climate change.
164000	168000	The most prominent one is the divide between rich and poor.
173000	178000	There is a clear connection between the prosperity of a nation and its carbon emissions.
178000	181000	In other words, richer people tend to cause more emissions.
181000	188000	So the key to fixing climate change is simply for the world's richest to cut back on their extravagant lifestyles, right?
188000	192000	While this would help, it wouldn't make the problem go away.
192000	198000	This is because 63% of global emissions come from low to middle income countries.
198000	207000	Countries where most people are not living extravagantly, but are trying to escape poverty at worst and achieve a comfortable lifestyle at best.
207000	214000	The unfortunate reality is that currently, escaping poverty and becoming middle class creates unavoidable emissions.
214000	220000	So asking developing countries to cut emissions just looks like an attempt to keep them down.
220000	227000	It's very hard to argue that a region should protect their primeval forests and spend money on soda panels instead of burning wood,
227000	231000	when it can't meet basic needs for significant parts of its population.
231000	240000	But cutting back is not a popular demand, especially if the countries making these demands got rich by causing environmental damage in the past.
240000	245000	So for billions of people, more emissions are a good thing, personally.
245000	250000	When we forget about this, we tend to propose unworkable solutions.
250000	256000	Take concrete. 8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete manufacturing industry.
257000	260000	Okay, cool. Stop using concrete, right?
260000	268000	But right now, concrete is also a cheap and easy way for growing populations in developing countries to build affordable housing.
268000	270000	And there are many examples like that.
270000	275000	Even rich countries aren't immune from disagreeing about rapid climate change solutions.
275000	282000	Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy mix is slowed down by heated discussions about what should replace them.
282000	289000	Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power, but also oppose wind or solar infrastructure in their backyards.
289000	295000	In principle, all of these issues can be overcome, but there are things we don't currently know how to overcome.
295000	298000	The most problematic one is food.
298000	301000	Emit or die.
301000	308000	We will soon need to feed 10 billion people, and we don't know how to do that without emitting greenhouse gases.
308000	315000	Because of the nature of modern food production that requires fertilizers or manure, it's impossible to have zero emissions food.
315000	323000	Rice alone emits so much methane each year that it practically equals the emissions of all the air traffic in the world.
323000	327000	What's worse is that the foods we like the most emit the most.
327000	337000	57% of food emissions come from animal-based foods, although they make up only 18% of the world's calories and 37% of its protein.
337000	342000	And as people across the world grow richer, they want more meat.
342000	347000	Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily plant-based, with a little meat on top.
347000	353000	But with the rise of industrial-style meat production and factory farming, meat has become a staple food.
353000	360000	A regular indulgence in developed countries, and a symbol of status and wealth in developing countries.
361000	370000	Today, about 40% of the world's habitable land is used for meat production in some form or another, the size of North and South America combined.
370000	381000	This is land we could otherwise allow native ecosystems to regrow, like forests in the Amazon, and suck carbon out of the atmosphere, but instead, most of it is used to feed animals.
381000	389000	The available solutions are uniquely able to make everybody on the political spectrum, rich or poor, unhappy.
389000	397000	Meat is highly emotional, and there are a lot of what-about-ism arguments floating around, like comparing it to the worst sources of emissions.
397000	406000	In the end, it's pretty simple. Eating less meat alone won't stop climate change, but we also can't stop climate change without eating less meat.
406000	413000	The same holds true for other things that are less crucial to our survival, but frankly not realistic to make go away.
413000	419000	Like air travel, overseas shipping, mining, and the production of devices that play YouTube videos.
419000	425000	So what does this mean? Do we need to give up our way of life, and can the poor never achieve it?
425000	432000	Can't some technology save us, so we can continue to drive our big cars and eat meat every day?
433000	436000	Solutions versus expenses.
436000	448000	In principle, this technology already exists. Direct air capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide from the air so that it can be stored underground or transformed into products.
448000	452000	So why aren't we implementing it in every industry everywhere?
452000	460000	Because with the technology we have right now, this would cost some $10 trillion per year, or half the United States' GDP.
460000	465000	This money has to come from somewhere, and currently no one is offering it.
465000	477000	Just dumping these costs on massive polluters like steel mills and coal power stations would double the cost of their products, and so these industries that operate on very tight profit margins would go bankrupt.
477000	489000	Getting the government to pay for it seems logical, but a lot of state resources are actually tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing oil and gas, which seems counterintuitive but follows clear incentives.
489000	499000	By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping and everyday goods are kept artificially cheap too, which has a major social impact on billions of people around the world.
499000	507000	That creates political lobbies and incentives that perpetuate a cycle that makes it so hard to stop fossil fuel production.
507000	516000	Meanwhile, very costly solutions for a far-off problem like carbon capture seem like they can wait, as technically nobody benefits from it right now.
517000	533000	Some argue that a move away from capitalism is the only solution to this mess, others insist that markets should be even freer, without any interventions like subsidies, and some suggest that we need what is referred to as de-growth, and to cut back as a species overall.
533000	543000	But the truth is, at least as of now, no political system is doing an impressive job at becoming truly sustainable, and none have really done so in the past.
543000	556000	We also don't have the time to figure this out and do a lot of experiments. We must implement solutions now, not just to halt the release of all possible greenhouse gases, but also to start reducing the amount of CO2 in the air.
556000	567000	It's too late to just mend our ways, we have to actively correct our past mistakes. With every year we waste, more extreme changes will be unavoidable.
567000	577000	Okay, let's take a deep breath. Rapid climate change and the world we live in are complicated, so here is where you, dear viewer, come in again.
577000	580000	Could you please fix the climate?
580000	587000	A narrative of our time is that we are all responsible for rapid climate change, that everyone needs to play their part.
588000	598000	Why don't you buy a new electric car? Why don't you replace your gas stove with an electric one? How about you double glaze your windows, stop eating meat, and switch off your lights?
598000	610000	Shifting responsibility from the largest carbon emitters to the average person, you, is much easier to do than solving problems. There's an extra bonus if solving rapid climate change sells a new product.
611000	618000	If you don't have the money or time for these things, you should feel bad. It's an effective message because it's true.
618000	631000	The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would be if all rich populations on Earth drastically changed their lifestyles and if the people on the rise would not seek to achieve it, favouring the climate over comfort and wealth.
631000	634000	If you're able to watch this video, that includes you.
634000	642000	But we've just witnessed a global experiment in staying at home, not using transport, and consuming less during the coronavirus pandemic.
642000	647000	And all it did was reduce CO2 emissions by 7% for 2020.
647000	653000	Asking average people to solve rapid climate change breaks down when we look at the scale of the problem.
653000	662000	Personal contributions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed by the systemic reality of global emissions.
662000	669000	The concept of your personal carbon footprint was popularised by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign.
669000	678000	Arguably one of the most effective and sinister pieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the situation.
678000	686000	If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for the rest of your life, you would save one second's worth of emissions from the global energy sector.
686000	691000	Even the most motivated person can't even make a tiny dent.
691000	700000	When we put together the dangers of rapid climate change, the scale of emissions and the lack of consensus over how to solve it, the challenge seems insurmountable.
700000	706000	It can cause decision fatigue and moral licensing where you no longer feel bad about behaving in a counterproductive way.
706000	712000	We have struggled a long time with this, which is why this video took us so long to make.
712000	715000	So, what can you actually do?
715000	718000	There are many different takes, and they are passionately discussed.
718000	724000	We don't know who's right, so we can only offer you the Kurzgesagt perspective and opinion.
724000	728000	Opinion part. What can you actually do?
729000	733000	We need a different way to think and talk about rapid climate change.
733000	740000	An all-encompassing systemic approach nothing less than changing the fundamentals of our modern industrial societies.
740000	745000	As discussed in frustrating length, the personal responsibility angle is overplayed.
745000	753000	For systemic changes in technology, politics and the economy of this magnitude, we need to influence the people at the levers.
754000	761000	Politicians need to know and feel strongly that the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change.
761000	773000	When governments and local politicians are reluctant to change laws that affect their biggest tax contributors or campaign donors, we need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science.
773000	778000	We need to hold them accountable for implementing the most effective climate change strategies.
778000	783000	Not waste our time with things like banning plastic straws, but by moving the big levers.
783000	790000	Food, transportation and energy, while not forgetting the smaller ones like cement or construction.
790000	807000	When industries fight against changing their ways, for fear of losses or an honest attempt to protect their own, we need politicians to change the laws and incentivize the deployment of existing technologies and massively invest in innovation for the fields where we don't have great solutions yet.
807000	814000	There's no reason that the profit interests of industries could not match the need to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible.
814000	821000	And if they still don't cooperate, harsh punishments and regulation need to force or bankrupt them.
821000	834000	It's still unrealistic that change of that scope can be forced onto a worldwide economy quickly enough, because many low-carbon technologies still need a lot of time and research, which means they're expensive.
835000	845000	But more companies will make more efficient carbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives, better batteries, cement alternatives and so on if there's a clear and growing demand.
845000	852000	And if you're affluent enough, you can do your part by investing in these things right now while they're still expensive.
852000	856000	These are the mechanisms that will drive the prices down later on.
856000	859000	So this is basically what you can do.
859000	862000	Vote at the ballot, vote with your wallet.
862000	866000	There are too many opposing interests and complicated gray zones.
866000	873000	In the end, if we truly get the systemic change we need, everybody will be unhappy about some aspect of it.
873000	880000	Only if we all accept that some solutions will have negative impacts for us can we have an honest conversation and make progress.
880000	884000	Everybody will be a little unhappy, and that's okay.
884000	886000	This is the best you can do.
886000	892000	You can deal with the reality of the situation and promote your priorities through your behavior and your actions.
892000	897000	And while you do so, you can eat less meat, fly less or get an electric car.
897000	909000	Not because you should feel guilty if you don't, or because you naively believe that you alone can stop rapid climate change, but to do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic change we need.
