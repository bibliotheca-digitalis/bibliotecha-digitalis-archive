00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
By the end of the 21st century,

00:02.360 --> 00:04.360
humanity is becoming desperate.

00:04.840 --> 00:12.360
Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.720
In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famines and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north.

00:19.240 --> 00:25.800
As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.880
It's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out,

00:29.920 --> 00:34.880
but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.300
So, in the near future, it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.040
Geoengineering.

00:44.480 --> 00:51.520
Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior, or make everything much worse.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.480
What is geoengineering, is it really an option, and what if it goes wrong?

01:05.840 --> 01:13.200
Geoengineering methods vary from fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space, to seeding clouds with salt, or

01:13.520 --> 01:19.120
wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.960
In this video, we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes.

01:24.760 --> 01:32.280
Stratospheric aerosol injection. A clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.440
Keeping the Sun away.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.240
CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own, almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the Sun in the form of

01:41.640 --> 01:43.400
electromagnetic radiation.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.360
About 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.840
This absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation, and

01:53.640 --> 01:58.480
CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.340
You can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.060
Even in a really cold room, your body emits

02:05.140 --> 02:11.240
infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.880
So one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket,

02:18.120 --> 02:20.120
which is already happening naturally.

02:20.480 --> 02:27.080
About 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.480
deserts, snow, or clouds.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.280
More reflection, less energy, less warming.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.200
We can look at nature for inspiration.

02:36.880 --> 02:43.000
Specifically, the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.

02:43.880 --> 02:50.720
Aside from massive devastation and almost 900 dead, scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate.

02:51.160 --> 02:58.040
The explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere, which hung around there for a while.

02:58.520 --> 03:04.780
The stuff that's interesting for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide, a nasty smelling and invisible gas.

03:05.160 --> 03:12.400
High in the atmosphere, it produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mix with water and created giant veils.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.760
These veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth's surface by roughly 1%.

03:18.500 --> 03:25.880
Global average temperatures dropped by 0.5 degrees Celsius. It took three years until this cooling effect had stopped.

03:26.800 --> 03:32.360
Humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere.

03:32.920 --> 03:39.280
According to some scientists, this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it.

03:39.880 --> 03:45.800
According to one study, it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of rapid climate change.

03:46.400 --> 03:54.000
A small fleet of specialized aircraft could ascend once a year and distribute aerosols along the equator from where they would be spread around the world.

03:55.160 --> 04:03.640
Projections assumed that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming,

04:04.240 --> 04:08.120
giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.320
Unfortunately, there might be a few unhappy side effects.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.460
There are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.680
Rainfall patterns could change, which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine. Billions of people could be affected in the worst case.

04:25.360 --> 04:32.040
Also, after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the acid water veils not only cooled down the surface,

04:32.200 --> 04:34.080
they also heated up the stratosphere.

04:34.600 --> 04:41.800
As it turns out, acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.360
Injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.720
Scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer,

04:53.880 --> 04:57.640
but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.920
But even if we don't damage the ozone layer, there are other risks.

05:02.520 --> 05:08.840
Politicians and industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy.

05:09.480 --> 05:15.800
Even if geoengineering slows down global warming, humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere.

05:16.280 --> 05:21.480
More CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2, which makes them more acidic.

05:22.200 --> 05:29.800
This is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs, and the longer this continues, the more severe the effects will be.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.040
But it gets worse.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.480
Once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale,

05:35.640 --> 05:40.280
we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.080
What that means is that if humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2,

05:45.400 --> 05:50.760
but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation, we're sitting on a time bomb.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.360
Once we stop geoengineering, the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up.

05:56.920 --> 06:04.680
But after a few decades of keeping the planet artificially cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2, it would heat up much, much quicker.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.800
An increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years.

06:10.440 --> 06:18.200
Such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.340
The worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems.

06:24.220 --> 06:29.820
Humanity might survive, but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world.

06:30.860 --> 06:37.020
The best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of rapid climate change,

06:37.640 --> 06:40.140
geoengineering can buy us a crucial decade or two.

06:40.860 --> 06:45.520
Time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere,

06:45.980 --> 06:49.020
maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.900
Conclusion.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.140
Geoengineering is a scary concept.

06:54.540 --> 07:02.140
It's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age.

07:02.780 --> 07:11.020
Over the last few decades, geoengineering has been so controversial that it stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better.

07:11.660 --> 07:15.020
But blankly opposing geoengineering is short-sighted.

07:15.580 --> 07:19.580
The sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment.

07:19.980 --> 07:25.580
We're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.940
This experiment is about to get really exciting.

07:29.900 --> 07:36.620
Hopefully, we'll never have to use geoengineering, but if we need to in the future, we better have done the science.

07:37.500 --> 07:45.340
We better be prepared or a panicking humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct button.

07:45.340 --> 07:51.660
You probably won't have to do any of that yourself, but who knows?

07:51.660 --> 07:54.700
Better brush up on your science knowledge just in case.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.500
