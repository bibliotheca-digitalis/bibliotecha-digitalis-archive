0	2000	By the end of the 21st century,
2360	4360	humanity is becoming desperate.
4840	12360	Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year.
12600	18720	In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famines and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north.
19240	25800	As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan.
26480	29880	It's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out,
29920	34880	but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible.
35480	41300	So, in the near future, it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change.
42040	44040	Geoengineering.
44480	51520	Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior, or make everything much worse.
52080	56480	What is geoengineering, is it really an option, and what if it goes wrong?
65840	73200	Geoengineering methods vary from fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space, to seeding clouds with salt, or
73520	79120	wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells.
79240	83960	In this video, we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes.
84760	92280	Stratospheric aerosol injection. A clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away.
93440	95440	Keeping the Sun away.
95720	101240	CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own, almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the Sun in the form of
101640	103400	electromagnetic radiation.
103400	108360	About 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere.
109160	112840	This absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation, and
113640	118480	CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while.
118920	122340	You can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning.
122520	125060	Even in a really cold room, your body emits
125140	131240	infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling.
131800	137880	So one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket,
138120	140120	which is already happening naturally.
140480	147080	About 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice,
147480	149480	deserts, snow, or clouds.
150040	153280	More reflection, less energy, less warming.
153900	156200	We can look at nature for inspiration.
156880	163000	Specifically, the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.
163880	170720	Aside from massive devastation and almost 900 dead, scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate.
171160	178040	The explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere, which hung around there for a while.
178520	184780	The stuff that's interesting for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide, a nasty smelling and invisible gas.
185160	192400	High in the atmosphere, it produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mix with water and created giant veils.
193120	197760	These veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth's surface by roughly 1%.
198500	205880	Global average temperatures dropped by 0.5 degrees Celsius. It took three years until this cooling effect had stopped.
206800	212360	Humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere.
212920	219280	According to some scientists, this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it.
219880	225800	According to one study, it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of rapid climate change.
226400	234000	A small fleet of specialized aircraft could ascend once a year and distribute aerosols along the equator from where they would be spread around the world.
235160	243640	Projections assumed that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming,
244240	248120	giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels.
249080	252320	Unfortunately, there might be a few unhappy side effects.
253000	256460	There are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections.
257000	264680	Rainfall patterns could change, which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine. Billions of people could be affected in the worst case.
265360	272040	Also, after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the acid water veils not only cooled down the surface,
272200	274080	they also heated up the stratosphere.
274600	281800	As it turns out, acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been.
282520	286360	Injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect.
287160	293720	Scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer,
293880	297640	but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work.
298280	301920	But even if we don't damage the ozone layer, there are other risks.
302520	308840	Politicians and industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy.
309480	315800	Even if geoengineering slows down global warming, humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere.
316280	321480	More CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2, which makes them more acidic.
322200	329800	This is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs, and the longer this continues, the more severe the effects will be.
330600	332040	But it gets worse.
332040	335480	Once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale,
335640	340280	we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock.
341000	345080	What that means is that if humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2,
345400	350760	but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation, we're sitting on a time bomb.
351480	356360	Once we stop geoengineering, the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up.
356920	364680	But after a few decades of keeping the planet artificially cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2, it would heat up much, much quicker.
365160	369800	An increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years.
370440	378200	Such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time.
378920	383340	The worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems.
384220	389820	Humanity might survive, but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world.
390860	397020	The best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of rapid climate change,
397640	400140	geoengineering can buy us a crucial decade or two.
400860	405520	Time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere,
405980	409020	maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video.
410360	411900	Conclusion.
411960	414140	Geoengineering is a scary concept.
414540	422140	It's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age.
422780	431020	Over the last few decades, geoengineering has been so controversial that it stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better.
431660	435020	But blankly opposing geoengineering is short-sighted.
435580	439580	The sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment.
439980	445580	We're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year.
446220	448940	This experiment is about to get really exciting.
449900	456620	Hopefully, we'll never have to use geoengineering, but if we need to in the future, we better have done the science.
457500	465340	We better be prepared or a panicking humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct button.
465340	471660	You probably won't have to do any of that yourself, but who knows?
471660	474700	Better brush up on your science knowledge just in case.
