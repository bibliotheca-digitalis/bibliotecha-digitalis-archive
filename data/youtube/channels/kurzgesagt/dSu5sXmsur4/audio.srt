1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
By the end of the 21st century,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,360
humanity is becoming desperate.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:12,360
Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,720
In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famines and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,800
As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,880
It's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,880
but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,300
So, in the near future, it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Geoengineering.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,520
Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior, or make everything much worse.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,480
What is geoengineering, is it really an option, and what if it goes wrong?

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,200
Geoengineering methods vary from fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space, to seeding clouds with salt, or

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,120
wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,960
In this video, we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes.

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:32,280
Stratospheric aerosol injection. A clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away.

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Keeping the Sun away.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,240
CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own, almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the Sun in the form of

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,400
electromagnetic radiation.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,360
About 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,840
This absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation, and

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,480
CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while.

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,340
You can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,060
Even in a really cold room, your body emits

24
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,240
infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling.

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,880
So one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket,

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
which is already happening naturally.

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,080
About 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice,

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
deserts, snow, or clouds.

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,280
More reflection, less energy, less warming.

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,200
We can look at nature for inspiration.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,000
Specifically, the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Aside from massive devastation and almost 900 dead, scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate.

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,040
The explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere, which hung around there for a while.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,780
The stuff that's interesting for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide, a nasty smelling and invisible gas.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,400
High in the atmosphere, it produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mix with water and created giant veils.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
These veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth's surface by roughly 1%.

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,880
Global average temperatures dropped by 0.5 degrees Celsius. It took three years until this cooling effect had stopped.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,360
Humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,280
According to some scientists, this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it.

40
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,800
According to one study, it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of rapid climate change.

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,000
A small fleet of specialized aircraft could ascend once a year and distribute aerosols along the equator from where they would be spread around the world.

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:03,640
Projections assumed that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming,

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,120
giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels.

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,320
Unfortunately, there might be a few unhappy side effects.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,460
There are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,680
Rainfall patterns could change, which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine. Billions of people could be affected in the worst case.

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Also, after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the acid water veils not only cooled down the surface,

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,080
they also heated up the stratosphere.

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,800
As it turns out, acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been.

50
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect.

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,720
Scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer,

52
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,640
but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,920
But even if we don't damage the ozone layer, there are other risks.

54
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,840
Politicians and industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy.

55
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Even if geoengineering slows down global warming, humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere.

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,480
More CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2, which makes them more acidic.

57
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,800
This is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs, and the longer this continues, the more severe the effects will be.

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,040
But it gets worse.

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,480
Once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale,

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,280
we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,080
What that means is that if humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2,

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,760
but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation, we're sitting on a time bomb.

63
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Once we stop geoengineering, the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up.

64
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,680
But after a few decades of keeping the planet artificially cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2, it would heat up much, much quicker.

65
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,800
An increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years.

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,200
Such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time.

67
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,340
The worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems.

68
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,820
Humanity might survive, but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world.

69
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,020
The best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of rapid climate change,

70
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,140
geoengineering can buy us a crucial decade or two.

71
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,520
Time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere,

72
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,020
maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video.

73
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,900
Conclusion.

74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,140
Geoengineering is a scary concept.

75
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:02,140
It's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age.

76
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:11,020
Over the last few decades, geoengineering has been so controversial that it stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better.

77
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,020
But blankly opposing geoengineering is short-sighted.

78
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,580
The sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment.

79
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,580
We're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year.

80
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,940
This experiment is about to get really exciting.

81
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,620
Hopefully, we'll never have to use geoengineering, but if we need to in the future, we better have done the science.

82
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,340
We better be prepared or a panicking humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct button.

83
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,660
You probably won't have to do any of that yourself, but who knows?

84
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,700
Better brush up on your science knowledge just in case.

85
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,500
