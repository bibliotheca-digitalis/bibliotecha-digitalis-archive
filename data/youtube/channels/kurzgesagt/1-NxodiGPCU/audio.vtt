00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hidden in the microverse all around you, there's a merciless war being fought by the true rulers of this planet, microorganisms.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Amoebae, protists, bacteria, archaea, and fungi compete for resources and space.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses, hunting everyone else.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
Not even alive, they are the tiniest, most abundant and deadliest beings on Earth, killing trillions every day.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Not interested in resources, only in living things to take over.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
Or so we thought. Turns out there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death, and other viruses hunting them.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
Considerably smaller than your cells or even bacteria, viruses are nothing but a hull, a tiny bit of genetic material and a few proteins.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
No metabolism, no way to propel themselves, no will or ambition.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
They float around aimlessly and hope to stumble upon a victim to infect and take over.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Viruses are so simple that we're not sure if they should count as living things or not.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Some scientists argue viruses are alive, others think that the cells they infect are the actual living viruses.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Hybrid organisms called viral cells, and the viral particles are more like seeds or spores.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And many others think viruses are just dead material.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
The origin of viruses is a mystery because how can something that needs victims to make more of itself emerge in the first place?

01:47.000 --> 01:59.000
There are many ideas. Viruses may have been essential steps in the emergence of life, or maybe they started out as escaped DNA from cells that became really good at making copies of themselves.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy parasites that let others do all the work for them.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
The current thinking is that viruses probably emerged multiple times from different origins, but we simply don't know for sure yet.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Whatever the truth is, viruses are the most successful beings on this planet.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
There's an estimated 10,000 billion billion billion viruses on Earth.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
If we put them all next to each other, they would stretch for 100 million light years, 500 Milky Way galaxies wide.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
Very recently, viruses became even weirder when scientists found a completely new type, giant viruses nicknamed gyrus.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Not only did it break all sorts of records, but questioned many assumptions we had about their nature.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
Gyruses even come with their own parasites, virophages, viruses that hunt other viruses, which seemingly makes no sense at all.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
And since we identified the first one in 2003, it seems like these giants are everywhere we look.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
In the oceans, in water towers, in the guts of pigs, and the mouths of humans.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And they're even weirder than we thought.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
Gyruses look funny, like hairy geometric forms or mini pickles, much larger than all viruses we knew before,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
which explains how they could hide in plain sight for centuries.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Scientists saw them under their microscopes and just thought they had to be bacteria.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
It's like suddenly discovering there are elephant-sized ducks everywhere.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Most gyruses we've found so far hunt amoebae and other single-celled beings.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
When they find a victim, they connect with it and use its natural processes to enter the cell.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Like all viruses, their goal is to misappropriate the victim's infrastructure and procreate.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth and using your guts and bones and fat tissue to build a mouse factory.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
The gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic material and rearranges the cell from the inside.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
Its structural elements, protein production machinery, and large amounts of mitochondria for energy

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
are changed to become an actual factory called viral plasm.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Some gyruses even construct a membrane to shield them from the cell's antiviral defenses.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
Once finished, the viral plasm begins to assemble new gyruses, using the victim up from the inside until it's filled up.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
Finally, the invader usually orders the cell to self-destruct and releases new gyruses to look for new prey.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
But what makes gyruses special is not their modus operandi or their size even,

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
it's that they are much more complex than thought possible for a virus.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Your cells have around 20,000 genes. A typical bacterium has a few thousand genes.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
The coronavirus has around 15, HIV or the flu around 10.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
The number of genes alone is certainly not everything. The tomato, for example, has 35,000 genes.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
But generally, we think of life as a complex system, so below a certain complexity level,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
something may be closer to dead material rather than a living organism.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
But gyruses can have hundreds or even thousands of genes, blurring the line between living and dead things.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
And it's not just the numbers that are special, but also what these genes do.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
We used to think of viral genes as the simplest of instructions,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
just enough to overcome the defense of their victims and make new viruses.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
But many gyrus genes are completely unique, basically mystery genes.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Even more confusing, a huge selection of their genes that are actually hallmarks of living things,

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
genes that regulate nutrient intake, energy production, light harvesting, replication,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
or are just necessary to keep cells alive.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Some recent studies have even suggested that some gyruses with very complex genomes

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
may be able to maintain a basic level of metabolism on their own,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
which if true, will shake up what we thought of viruses even more.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
We still don't know anything for sure, but one idea about gyrus genes

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
is that they might fundamentally alter the physiology and evolution of their victims,

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
by integrating their own genomes and merging with them into chimeric organisms.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Or, the other way around, take some host genes with them and be changed themselves.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
For billions of years, gyruses may have been existing alongside and infecting cells,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
exerting an unseen influence on the development of life.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
Not just as a parasite, but jerking evolution in different directions by mixing genes around in all directions.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Which brings us to another unique thing about them,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
virophages, the viruses hunting gyruses.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
The concept itself is a bit mind-boggling.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
How can a thing that might be dead hunt another thing that might be dead too?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Let's look at one of them.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
The virophage sputnik is hunting a gyrus called mamavirus that itself is hunting amoebae.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Sputnik is a tiny minimalistic virus that doesn't even have the genes and tools to replicate itself.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
What it does have is the ability to hijack the viroplasm factories of mamaviruses.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
So, virophages need their victim, the gyrus, to infect their victim, an amoeba, first,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
and then they can parasitize it.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
A mamavirus viroplasm infected by sputnik can only produce very few new gyruses,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
and among these, many are deformed and broken, unable to infect further cells.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Instead, it makes loads of new sputnik virophages.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Other virophages are even more subtle.

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
When they infect a viroplasm, they just integrate their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses, like sleeper agents.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The next time one of these infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
it produces mostly virophages instead of gyruses.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Gyruses are not completely defenseless, though.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
A few years ago, the world was in awe when scientists discovered CRISPR,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
a bacteria defense system against viruses.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
It turns out some gyruses have a system that might be similar,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
a sort of gyrus immune system against virophages.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
In turn, virophages can also be used as an anti-gyrus defense mechanism by living cells.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
Some protists have been found that integrated the genetic code of virophages into their genome and kept it.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
When the protists were infected by gyruses,

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
they used the code to create virophages themselves to take over the gyrus factories.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
In the end, the protists would still be killed by the gyrus infection,

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
but instead of releasing gyruses to kill its buddies, it released virophages to hunt them.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
The amazing thing about everything we've told you in this video is that we're still very much at the beginning.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
It's not even been 20 years since the discovery of gyruses and virophages.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
There is so much going on in the microverse.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Life is not an isolated event, but a ping-pong game of trillions of organisms and viruses.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So when you feel down and like there's not that much new to discover,

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
think of gyruses and all the other elephant-sized ducks all around us.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Invisible until we look more closely.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
But how do you learn to look at the world like a scientist?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
