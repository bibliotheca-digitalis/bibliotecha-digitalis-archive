0	10000	Hidden in the microverse all around you, there's a merciless war being fought by the true rulers of this planet, microorganisms.
10000	17000	Amoebae, protists, bacteria, archaea, and fungi compete for resources and space.
17000	22000	And then there are the strange horrors that are viruses, hunting everyone else.
23000	30000	Not even alive, they are the tiniest, most abundant and deadliest beings on Earth, killing trillions every day.
30000	35000	Not interested in resources, only in living things to take over.
35000	46000	Or so we thought. Turns out there are giant viruses that blur the line between life and death, and other viruses hunting them.
53000	63000	Considerably smaller than your cells or even bacteria, viruses are nothing but a hull, a tiny bit of genetic material and a few proteins.
63000	68000	No metabolism, no way to propel themselves, no will or ambition.
68000	74000	They float around aimlessly and hope to stumble upon a victim to infect and take over.
74000	80000	Viruses are so simple that we're not sure if they should count as living things or not.
80000	88000	Some scientists argue viruses are alive, others think that the cells they infect are the actual living viruses.
88000	95000	Hybrid organisms called viral cells, and the viral particles are more like seeds or spores.
95000	99000	And many others think viruses are just dead material.
99000	107000	The origin of viruses is a mystery because how can something that needs victims to make more of itself emerge in the first place?
107000	119000	There are many ideas. Viruses may have been essential steps in the emergence of life, or maybe they started out as escaped DNA from cells that became really good at making copies of themselves.
119000	125000	Maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy parasites that let others do all the work for them.
125000	133000	The current thinking is that viruses probably emerged multiple times from different origins, but we simply don't know for sure yet.
134000	140000	Whatever the truth is, viruses are the most successful beings on this planet.
140000	145000	There's an estimated 10,000 billion billion billion viruses on Earth.
145000	153000	If we put them all next to each other, they would stretch for 100 million light years, 500 Milky Way galaxies wide.
153000	163000	Very recently, viruses became even weirder when scientists found a completely new type, giant viruses nicknamed gyrus.
163000	169000	Not only did it break all sorts of records, but questioned many assumptions we had about their nature.
169000	178000	Gyruses even come with their own parasites, virophages, viruses that hunt other viruses, which seemingly makes no sense at all.
178000	185000	And since we identified the first one in 2003, it seems like these giants are everywhere we look.
185000	191000	In the oceans, in water towers, in the guts of pigs, and the mouths of humans.
191000	193000	And they're even weirder than we thought.
193000	201000	Gyruses look funny, like hairy geometric forms or mini pickles, much larger than all viruses we knew before,
201000	205000	which explains how they could hide in plain sight for centuries.
205000	210000	Scientists saw them under their microscopes and just thought they had to be bacteria.
210000	214000	It's like suddenly discovering there are elephant-sized ducks everywhere.
214000	220000	Most gyruses we've found so far hunt amoebae and other single-celled beings.
220000	226000	When they find a victim, they connect with it and use its natural processes to enter the cell.
226000	232000	Like all viruses, their goal is to misappropriate the victim's infrastructure and procreate.
232000	239000	Imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth and using your guts and bones and fat tissue to build a mouse factory.
239000	246000	The gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic material and rearranges the cell from the inside.
246000	252000	Its structural elements, protein production machinery, and large amounts of mitochondria for energy
252000	256000	are changed to become an actual factory called viral plasm.
256000	262000	Some gyruses even construct a membrane to shield them from the cell's antiviral defenses.
262000	270000	Once finished, the viral plasm begins to assemble new gyruses, using the victim up from the inside until it's filled up.
270000	278000	Finally, the invader usually orders the cell to self-destruct and releases new gyruses to look for new prey.
278000	284000	But what makes gyruses special is not their modus operandi or their size even,
284000	288000	it's that they are much more complex than thought possible for a virus.
288000	295000	Your cells have around 20,000 genes. A typical bacterium has a few thousand genes.
295000	300000	The coronavirus has around 15, HIV or the flu around 10.
300000	307000	The number of genes alone is certainly not everything. The tomato, for example, has 35,000 genes.
307000	313000	But generally, we think of life as a complex system, so below a certain complexity level,
313000	317000	something may be closer to dead material rather than a living organism.
317000	325000	But gyruses can have hundreds or even thousands of genes, blurring the line between living and dead things.
325000	330000	And it's not just the numbers that are special, but also what these genes do.
330000	334000	We used to think of viral genes as the simplest of instructions,
334000	339000	just enough to overcome the defense of their victims and make new viruses.
339000	344000	But many gyrus genes are completely unique, basically mystery genes.
344000	351000	Even more confusing, a huge selection of their genes that are actually hallmarks of living things,
351000	357000	genes that regulate nutrient intake, energy production, light harvesting, replication,
357000	360000	or are just necessary to keep cells alive.
360000	365000	Some recent studies have even suggested that some gyruses with very complex genomes
365000	369000	may be able to maintain a basic level of metabolism on their own,
369000	373000	which if true, will shake up what we thought of viruses even more.
373000	378000	We still don't know anything for sure, but one idea about gyrus genes
378000	382000	is that they might fundamentally alter the physiology and evolution of their victims,
382000	388000	by integrating their own genomes and merging with them into chimeric organisms.
388000	394000	Or, the other way around, take some host genes with them and be changed themselves.
394000	400000	For billions of years, gyruses may have been existing alongside and infecting cells,
400000	403000	exerting an unseen influence on the development of life.
403000	410000	Not just as a parasite, but jerking evolution in different directions by mixing genes around in all directions.
410000	414000	Which brings us to another unique thing about them,
414000	417000	virophages, the viruses hunting gyruses.
417000	420000	The concept itself is a bit mind-boggling.
420000	424000	How can a thing that might be dead hunt another thing that might be dead too?
424000	426000	Let's look at one of them.
426000	433000	The virophage sputnik is hunting a gyrus called mamavirus that itself is hunting amoebae.
433000	439000	Sputnik is a tiny minimalistic virus that doesn't even have the genes and tools to replicate itself.
439000	445000	What it does have is the ability to hijack the viroplasm factories of mamaviruses.
445000	451000	So, virophages need their victim, the gyrus, to infect their victim, an amoeba, first,
451000	454000	and then they can parasitize it.
454000	460000	A mamavirus viroplasm infected by sputnik can only produce very few new gyruses,
460000	465000	and among these, many are deformed and broken, unable to infect further cells.
465000	469000	Instead, it makes loads of new sputnik virophages.
469000	472000	Other virophages are even more subtle.
472000	480000	When they infect a viroplasm, they just integrate their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses, like sleeper agents.
480000	485000	The next time one of these infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell,
485000	489000	it produces mostly virophages instead of gyruses.
489000	492000	Gyruses are not completely defenseless, though.
492000	497000	A few years ago, the world was in awe when scientists discovered CRISPR,
497000	500000	a bacteria defense system against viruses.
500000	504000	It turns out some gyruses have a system that might be similar,
504000	508000	a sort of gyrus immune system against virophages.
508000	514000	In turn, virophages can also be used as an anti-gyrus defense mechanism by living cells.
514000	521000	Some protists have been found that integrated the genetic code of virophages into their genome and kept it.
521000	524000	When the protists were infected by gyruses,
524000	530000	they used the code to create virophages themselves to take over the gyrus factories.
530000	534000	In the end, the protists would still be killed by the gyrus infection,
534000	540000	but instead of releasing gyruses to kill its buddies, it released virophages to hunt them.
540000	546000	The amazing thing about everything we've told you in this video is that we're still very much at the beginning.
546000	551000	It's not even been 20 years since the discovery of gyruses and virophages.
551000	554000	There is so much going on in the microverse.
554000	560000	Life is not an isolated event, but a ping-pong game of trillions of organisms and viruses.
560000	564000	So when you feel down and like there's not that much new to discover,
564000	569000	think of gyruses and all the other elephant-sized ducks all around us.
569000	572000	Invisible until we look more closely.
573000	577000	But how do you learn to look at the world like a scientist?
