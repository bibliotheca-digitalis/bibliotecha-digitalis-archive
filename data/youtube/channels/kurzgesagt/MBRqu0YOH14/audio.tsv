0	4000	Human existence is scary and confusing.
4000	9000	A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place.
9000	14000	It was filled with other beings. We could eat some, some could eat us.
14000	19000	There was liquid stuff we could drink, things we could use to make more things.
19000	23000	The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.
23000	25000	The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.
25000	28000	This place was obviously made for us.
28000	31000	Something was watching over us. We were home.
31000	35000	This made everything much less scary and confusing.
35000	39000	But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves.
39000	43000	We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are.
43000	47000	We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,
47000	50000	and that it is much, much older than we thought.
50000	56000	We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead for some reason,
56000	61000	and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.
61000	66000	We learned, in all, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star
66000	72000	in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave.
72000	77000	And this group is only one of thousands that together make up a galaxy supercluster.
77000	83000	But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.
83000	87000	The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know.
87000	93000	We could throw words around like 200 billion galaxies, or trillions of stars, or bazillions of planets,
93000	95000	but all of these numbers mean nothing.
95000	98000	Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.
98000	102000	The universe is too big. There is too much of it.
102000	105000	But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.
105000	109000	It's time, or more precisely, the time we have.
110000	115000	If you're lucky enough to live to 100, you have 5,200 weeks at your disposal.
115000	120000	If you're 25 now, then you have 3,900 weeks left.
120000	125000	If you're going to die at 70, then there are 2,340 weeks left.
125000	129000	A lot of time, but also not really.
129000	131000	And then what?
131000	137000	Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop being dynamic.
137000	141000	It will dissolve until there is no you left.
141000	146000	Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out.
146000	151000	So this life might be it, and we might end up dead forever.
151000	153000	This is less scary than it sounds, though.
153000	158000	If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,
158000	164000	then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.
164000	167000	Close your eyes. Count to one.
167000	170000	That's how long forever feels.
170000	176000	And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die, and nothing will ever change again.
176000	182000	Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.
182000	185000	So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things.
185000	188000	An unscientific, subjective point of view.
188000	191000	The philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want.
191000	196000	Please take it with a grain of salt, we don't know any more about human existence than you do.
196000	200000	We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.
200000	202000	What do we mean by that?
202000	208000	Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us.
208000	212000	In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us.
212000	216000	We became self-aware, only to realize this story is not about us.
216000	223000	While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.
223000	225000	Okay, but so what?
225000	230000	You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free.
230000	235000	If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten.
235000	238000	Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.
238000	241000	Every bad thing you did will be voided.
241000	246000	If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters.
246000	251000	If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on.
251000	256000	If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is.
256000	260000	Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point.
260000	264000	But before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us.
264000	266000	We get to experience feelings.
266000	270000	We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other.
270000	275000	The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.
275000	280000	It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true.
280000	285000	We are as much the universe as a neutron star, or a black hole, or a nebula.
285000	291000	Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part, the sensory organs of the universe.
291000	295000	We are truly free in a universe-sized playground.
295000	300000	So we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.
300000	303000	It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know.
303000	309000	We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is.
309000	314000	We have no idea what consciousness is, or if we are alone in the universe.
314000	317000	But we can try to find some answers.
317000	322000	There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help,
322000	326000	happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish.
326000	328000	There is so much to do.
328000	333000	So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.
333000	339000	If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happily as possible.
339000	342000	Bonus points if you make the life of other people better.
342000	346000	More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.
346000	348000	Do the things that make you feel good.
348000	351000	You get to decide whatever this means for you.
