1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Human existence is scary and confusing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was filled with other beings. We could eat some, some could eat us.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There was liquid stuff we could drink, things we could use to make more things.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This place was obviously made for us.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Something was watching over us. We were home.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This made everything much less scary and confusing.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and that it is much, much older than we thought.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead for some reason,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We learned, in all, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And this group is only one of thousands that together make up a galaxy supercluster.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We could throw words around like 200 billion galaxies, or trillions of stars, or bazillions of planets,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but all of these numbers mean nothing.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The universe is too big. There is too much of it.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's time, or more precisely, the time we have.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you're lucky enough to live to 100, you have 5,200 weeks at your disposal.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you're 25 now, then you have 3,900 weeks left.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you're going to die at 70, then there are 2,340 weeks left.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A lot of time, but also not really.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then what?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop being dynamic.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It will dissolve until there is no you left.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So this life might be it, and we might end up dead forever.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is less scary than it sounds, though.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Close your eyes. Count to one.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's how long forever feels.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die, and nothing will ever change again.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
An unscientific, subjective point of view.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please take it with a grain of salt, we don't know any more about human existence than you do.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do we mean by that?

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We became self-aware, only to realize this story is not about us.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, but so what?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Every bad thing you did will be voided.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We get to experience feelings.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We are as much the universe as a neutron star, or a black hole, or a nebula.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part, the sensory organs of the universe.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We are truly free in a universe-sized playground.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We have no idea what consciousness is, or if we are alone in the universe.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But we can try to find some answers.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help,

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is so much to do.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happily as possible.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bonus points if you make the life of other people better.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do the things that make you feel good.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You get to decide whatever this means for you.
