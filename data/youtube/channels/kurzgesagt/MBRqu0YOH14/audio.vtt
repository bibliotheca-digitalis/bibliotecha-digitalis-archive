00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Human existence is scary and confusing.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
It was filled with other beings. We could eat some, some could eat us.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
There was liquid stuff we could drink, things we could use to make more things.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
The night sky was filled with beautiful lights.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
This place was obviously made for us.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Something was watching over us. We were home.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
This made everything much less scary and confusing.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
and that it is much, much older than we thought.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead for some reason,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
We learned, in all, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
And this group is only one of thousands that together make up a galaxy supercluster.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
We could throw words around like 200 billion galaxies, or trillions of stars, or bazillions of planets,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
but all of these numbers mean nothing.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Our brains can't comprehend these concepts.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
The universe is too big. There is too much of it.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
It's time, or more precisely, the time we have.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
If you're lucky enough to live to 100, you have 5,200 weeks at your disposal.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
If you're 25 now, then you have 3,900 weeks left.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
If you're going to die at 70, then there are 2,340 weeks left.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
A lot of time, but also not really.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
And then what?

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop being dynamic.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
It will dissolve until there is no you left.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
So this life might be it, and we might end up dead forever.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
This is less scary than it sounds, though.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed,

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Close your eyes. Count to one.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
That's how long forever feels.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die, and nothing will ever change again.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
An unscientific, subjective point of view.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
The philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Please take it with a grain of salt, we don't know any more about human existence than you do.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What do we mean by that?

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
We became self-aware, only to realize this story is not about us.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay, but so what?

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Every mistake you made will not matter in the end.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Every bad thing you did will be voided.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
But before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
We get to experience feelings.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
We are as much the universe as a neutron star, or a black hole, or a nebula.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part, the sensory organs of the universe.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
We are truly free in a universe-sized playground.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
We have no idea what consciousness is, or if we are alone in the universe.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
But we can try to find some answers.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
There is so much to do.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happily as possible.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Bonus points if you make the life of other people better.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Do the things that make you feel good.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
You get to decide whatever this means for you.
