1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news. Only graphs that get

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,960
more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:19,040
harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It's endless and relentless.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,920
We've known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release of greenhouse

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,520
gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:39,400
the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:50,080
emitting these gases?

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,200
Our collective CO2 emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,960
with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO2 emissions are still rising, and two explain

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,980
how we can stop that. Population size, economic growth, energy intensity, and emissions per

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:19,880
energy unit produced. Number one, population size. People need food, homes, and clothing.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,720
And they demand luxury products from iPhones to $1 cheeseburgers. More people, higher CO2

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,120
emissions. It's a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according

14
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:40,160
to the UN, it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,080
only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare and access to contraception

16
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,780
and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take

17
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,960
a few decades for the effects of lower birth rates to manifest themselves. So the global

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,920
population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and as a consequence, global CO2 emissions

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,720
will rise over the next few decades. Number two, growth or getting richer. But it's not

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,920
just about our numbers. The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,440
produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO2 footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,480
world's wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it's far from evenly distributed,

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,920
economic growth has led to the highest standards of living and the largest reduction in extreme

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,400
poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies,

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,520
no matter what kind of political system they have. It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the

26
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,720
concept of growth anytime soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,400
too. For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor, and so developing

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,720
countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can be sure that growth

29
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,400
as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away anytime soon. More countries and their

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,640
citizens around the world will grow and become richer, while the rich economies will continue

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,360
to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO2 emissions,

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,280
but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO2 emissions will rise.

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,320
Okay, so far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth,

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,560
humanity's CO2 emissions will increase, which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,760
to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:56,240
do this. Number three, energy intensity. Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy.

37
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,360
A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook, while a street food vendor in France

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,360
might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,280
more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something, be it powering a metropolitan

40
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,480
area or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient and coming up with more efficient

41
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,120
ways to organize our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's CO2

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,800
dependency. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with AI, the electrification of

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,920
the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities

44
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,280
for improvement are almost limitless and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing

45
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,800
efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for three reasons. One, direct rebound effects. This

46
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,160
means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more and so overall the increased

47
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,680
efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. Or worse,

48
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,680
sometimes more efficiency makes humans not use less of a resource, but more of it. When planes

49
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,080
became more fuel efficient, ticket prices decreased and more people started to travel by plane. So

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,840
making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the

51
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,320
opposite effect. Two, indirect rebound effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that's

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,720
become more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,320
fuel efficient car, you save money on fuel and end up with extra funds in your bank account that

54
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,080
you might spend on a vacation and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more

55
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:58,520
CO2 despite getting a more efficient car. Three, and lastly, the more you optimize for efficiency,

56
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,340
the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So over time, the return on

57
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,420
investment slows down. And with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But regardless

58
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,660
of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy,

59
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,140
we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won't create a zero carbon world. This brings us to

60
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:32,220
our last factor. Number four, CO2 emissions per energy unit used or our global carbon footprint.

61
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,940
Humanities global carbon footprint is the CO2 released per energy unit generated. For example,

62
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,860
coal plants release much, much more CO2 than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is

63
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,820
crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO2 output. Fossil fuels are the

64
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,100
greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight

65
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,780
without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is that we're not doing nearly enough

66
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,420
to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower carbon alternatives. We need to do two things to

67
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,420
speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have

68
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,980
today with today's technology. There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave

69
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,100
nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and funnel

70
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,660
them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly and increase the price each year to create

71
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,380
strong incentives for the world's industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for

72
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,100
energy efficiency and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel

73
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:55,780
vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and

74
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,420
innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO2 emission world, be it from technologies

75
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,900
like carbon capture or a new generation of nuclear power plants to new batteries that revolutionize

76
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:15,140
the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time, years and decades, and we don't have

77
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,740
this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can't keep relying

78
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,780
on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today while we invent what we

79
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,500
will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we

80
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,420
give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we

81
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,580
can compensate for economic growth and the people born today. The more coal power plants in

82
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:52,540
construction we start from being finished, the more CO2 we save. Neither innovation nor the alternatives

83
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,620
we're using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But innovation, together with a decisive

84
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:05,020
move away from fossil fuels where it's possible today, could do it. Solving climate change will

85
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,900
be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right

86
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:18,580
now society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as

87
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:26,620
quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible. We'll look at different aspects of

88
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,860
climate change and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know
