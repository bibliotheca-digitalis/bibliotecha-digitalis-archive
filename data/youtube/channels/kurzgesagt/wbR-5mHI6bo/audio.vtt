00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news. Only graphs that get

00:06.400 --> 00:11.960
more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the

00:11.960 --> 00:19.040
harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It's endless and relentless.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.920
We've known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release of greenhouse

00:23.920 --> 00:31.520
gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in

00:31.520 --> 00:39.400
the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop

00:39.400 --> 00:50.080
emitting these gases?

00:50.080 --> 00:55.200
Our collective CO2 emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship

00:55.200 --> 01:01.960
with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO2 emissions are still rising, and two explain

01:01.960 --> 01:09.980
how we can stop that. Population size, economic growth, energy intensity, and emissions per

01:09.980 --> 01:19.880
energy unit produced. Number one, population size. People need food, homes, and clothing.

01:19.880 --> 01:26.720
And they demand luxury products from iPhones to $1 cheeseburgers. More people, higher CO2

01:26.720 --> 01:32.120
emissions. It's a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according

01:32.120 --> 01:40.160
to the UN, it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The

01:40.160 --> 01:45.080
only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare and access to contraception

01:45.080 --> 01:50.780
and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take

01:50.780 --> 01:55.960
a few decades for the effects of lower birth rates to manifest themselves. So the global

01:55.960 --> 02:01.920
population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and as a consequence, global CO2 emissions

02:01.920 --> 02:09.720
will rise over the next few decades. Number two, growth or getting richer. But it's not

02:09.720 --> 02:15.920
just about our numbers. The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle

02:15.920 --> 02:23.440
produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO2 footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The

02:23.440 --> 02:29.480
world's wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it's far from evenly distributed,

02:29.480 --> 02:33.920
economic growth has led to the highest standards of living and the largest reduction in extreme

02:33.920 --> 02:40.400
poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies,

02:40.400 --> 02:46.520
no matter what kind of political system they have. It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the

02:46.520 --> 02:52.720
concept of growth anytime soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich

02:52.720 --> 02:59.400
too. For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor, and so developing

02:59.400 --> 03:04.720
countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can be sure that growth

03:04.720 --> 03:11.400
as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away anytime soon. More countries and their

03:11.400 --> 03:16.640
citizens around the world will grow and become richer, while the rich economies will continue

03:16.640 --> 03:22.360
to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO2 emissions,

03:22.360 --> 03:28.280
but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO2 emissions will rise.

03:28.280 --> 03:33.320
Okay, so far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth,

03:33.320 --> 03:40.560
humanity's CO2 emissions will increase, which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need

03:40.560 --> 03:47.760
to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually

03:47.760 --> 03:56.240
do this. Number three, energy intensity. Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy.

03:56.280 --> 04:02.360
A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook, while a street food vendor in France

04:02.360 --> 04:09.360
might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The

04:09.360 --> 04:15.280
more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something, be it powering a metropolitan

04:15.280 --> 04:21.480
area or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient and coming up with more efficient

04:21.480 --> 04:27.120
ways to organize our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's CO2

04:27.120 --> 04:33.800
dependency. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with AI, the electrification of

04:33.800 --> 04:39.920
the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities

04:39.920 --> 04:47.280
for improvement are almost limitless and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing

04:47.320 --> 04:55.800
efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for three reasons. One, direct rebound effects. This

04:55.800 --> 05:01.160
means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more and so overall the increased

05:01.160 --> 05:06.680
efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. Or worse,

05:06.680 --> 05:13.680
sometimes more efficiency makes humans not use less of a resource, but more of it. When planes

05:13.800 --> 05:20.080
became more fuel efficient, ticket prices decreased and more people started to travel by plane. So

05:20.080 --> 05:26.840
making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the

05:26.840 --> 05:34.320
opposite effect. Two, indirect rebound effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that's

05:34.320 --> 05:38.720
become more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more

05:38.720 --> 05:44.320
fuel efficient car, you save money on fuel and end up with extra funds in your bank account that

05:44.320 --> 05:50.080
you might spend on a vacation and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more

05:50.080 --> 05:58.520
CO2 despite getting a more efficient car. Three, and lastly, the more you optimize for efficiency,

05:58.520 --> 06:04.340
the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So over time, the return on

06:04.340 --> 06:11.420
investment slows down. And with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But regardless

06:11.420 --> 06:15.660
of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy,

06:15.660 --> 06:24.140
we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won't create a zero carbon world. This brings us to

06:24.140 --> 06:32.220
our last factor. Number four, CO2 emissions per energy unit used or our global carbon footprint.

06:32.220 --> 06:39.940
Humanities global carbon footprint is the CO2 released per energy unit generated. For example,

06:39.940 --> 06:45.860
coal plants release much, much more CO2 than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is

06:45.860 --> 06:52.820
crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO2 output. Fossil fuels are the

06:52.820 --> 06:59.100
greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight

06:59.140 --> 07:04.780
without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is that we're not doing nearly enough

07:04.780 --> 07:11.420
to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower carbon alternatives. We need to do two things to

07:11.420 --> 07:17.420
speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have

07:17.420 --> 07:23.980
today with today's technology. There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave

07:23.980 --> 07:30.100
nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and funnel

07:30.100 --> 07:36.660
them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly and increase the price each year to create

07:36.660 --> 07:42.380
strong incentives for the world's industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for

07:42.380 --> 07:48.100
energy efficiency and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel

07:48.100 --> 07:55.780
vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and

07:55.780 --> 08:01.420
innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO2 emission world, be it from technologies

08:01.420 --> 08:06.900
like carbon capture or a new generation of nuclear power plants to new batteries that revolutionize

08:06.900 --> 08:15.140
the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time, years and decades, and we don't have

08:15.140 --> 08:21.740
this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can't keep relying

08:21.740 --> 08:27.780
on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today while we invent what we

08:27.780 --> 08:33.500
will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we

08:33.500 --> 08:39.420
give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we

08:39.420 --> 08:45.580
can compensate for economic growth and the people born today. The more coal power plants in

08:45.580 --> 08:52.540
construction we start from being finished, the more CO2 we save. Neither innovation nor the alternatives

08:52.540 --> 08:58.620
we're using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But innovation, together with a decisive

08:58.620 --> 09:05.020
move away from fossil fuels where it's possible today, could do it. Solving climate change will

09:05.020 --> 09:10.900
be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right

09:10.900 --> 09:18.580
now society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as

09:18.580 --> 09:26.620
quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible. We'll look at different aspects of

09:26.620 --> 09:31.860
climate change and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know

to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero

09:48.100 --> 09:54.220
carbon emissions. Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data for helping us out with
