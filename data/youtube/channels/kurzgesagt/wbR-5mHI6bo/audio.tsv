0	6400	Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news. Only graphs that get
6400	11960	more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the
11960	19040	harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It's endless and relentless.
19040	23920	We've known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release of greenhouse
23920	31520	gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in
31520	39400	the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop
39400	50080	emitting these gases?
50080	55200	Our collective CO2 emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship
55200	61960	with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO2 emissions are still rising, and two explain
61960	69980	how we can stop that. Population size, economic growth, energy intensity, and emissions per
69980	79880	energy unit produced. Number one, population size. People need food, homes, and clothing.
79880	86720	And they demand luxury products from iPhones to $1 cheeseburgers. More people, higher CO2
86720	92120	emissions. It's a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according
92120	100160	to the UN, it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The
100160	105080	only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare and access to contraception
105080	110780	and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take
110780	115960	a few decades for the effects of lower birth rates to manifest themselves. So the global
115960	121920	population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and as a consequence, global CO2 emissions
121920	129720	will rise over the next few decades. Number two, growth or getting richer. But it's not
129720	135920	just about our numbers. The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle
135920	143440	produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO2 footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The
143440	149480	world's wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it's far from evenly distributed,
149480	153920	economic growth has led to the highest standards of living and the largest reduction in extreme
153920	160400	poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies,
160400	166520	no matter what kind of political system they have. It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the
166520	172720	concept of growth anytime soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich
172720	179400	too. For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor, and so developing
179400	184720	countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can be sure that growth
184720	191400	as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away anytime soon. More countries and their
191400	196640	citizens around the world will grow and become richer, while the rich economies will continue
196640	202360	to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO2 emissions,
202360	208280	but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO2 emissions will rise.
208280	213320	Okay, so far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth,
213320	220560	humanity's CO2 emissions will increase, which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need
220560	227760	to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually
227760	236240	do this. Number three, energy intensity. Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy.
236280	242360	A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook, while a street food vendor in France
242360	249360	might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The
249360	255280	more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something, be it powering a metropolitan
255280	261480	area or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient and coming up with more efficient
261480	267120	ways to organize our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's CO2
267120	273800	dependency. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with AI, the electrification of
273800	279920	the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities
279920	287280	for improvement are almost limitless and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing
287320	295800	efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for three reasons. One, direct rebound effects. This
295800	301160	means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more and so overall the increased
301160	306680	efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. Or worse,
306680	313680	sometimes more efficiency makes humans not use less of a resource, but more of it. When planes
313800	320080	became more fuel efficient, ticket prices decreased and more people started to travel by plane. So
320080	326840	making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the
326840	334320	opposite effect. Two, indirect rebound effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that's
334320	338720	become more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more
338720	344320	fuel efficient car, you save money on fuel and end up with extra funds in your bank account that
344320	350080	you might spend on a vacation and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more
350080	358520	CO2 despite getting a more efficient car. Three, and lastly, the more you optimize for efficiency,
358520	364340	the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So over time, the return on
364340	371420	investment slows down. And with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But regardless
371420	375660	of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy,
375660	384140	we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won't create a zero carbon world. This brings us to
384140	392220	our last factor. Number four, CO2 emissions per energy unit used or our global carbon footprint.
392220	399940	Humanities global carbon footprint is the CO2 released per energy unit generated. For example,
399940	405860	coal plants release much, much more CO2 than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is
405860	412820	crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO2 output. Fossil fuels are the
412820	419100	greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight
419140	424780	without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is that we're not doing nearly enough
424780	431420	to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower carbon alternatives. We need to do two things to
431420	437420	speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have
437420	443980	today with today's technology. There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave
443980	450100	nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and funnel
450100	456660	them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly and increase the price each year to create
456660	462380	strong incentives for the world's industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for
462380	468100	energy efficiency and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel
468100	475780	vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and
475780	481420	innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO2 emission world, be it from technologies
481420	486900	like carbon capture or a new generation of nuclear power plants to new batteries that revolutionize
486900	495140	the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time, years and decades, and we don't have
495140	501740	this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can't keep relying
501740	507780	on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today while we invent what we
507780	513500	will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we
513500	519420	give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we
519420	525580	can compensate for economic growth and the people born today. The more coal power plants in
525580	532540	construction we start from being finished, the more CO2 we save. Neither innovation nor the alternatives
532540	538620	we're using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But innovation, together with a decisive
538620	545020	move away from fossil fuels where it's possible today, could do it. Solving climate change will
545020	550900	be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right
550900	558580	now society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as
558580	566620	quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible. We'll look at different aspects of
566620	571860	climate change and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know

583740	588100	to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero
588100	594220	carbon emissions. Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data for helping us out with
