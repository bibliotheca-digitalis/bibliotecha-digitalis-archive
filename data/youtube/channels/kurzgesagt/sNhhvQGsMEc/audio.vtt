00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Are we the only living things in the entire universe?

00:03.840 --> 00:08.560
The observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter.

00:08.560 --> 00:15.280
There are at least 100 billion galaxies, each with 100 to 1,000 billion stars.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.040
Recently, we've learned that planets are very common too.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.840
And there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe,

00:23.840 --> 00:29.040
which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist, right?

00:29.040 --> 00:30.320
But where is it?

00:30.320 --> 00:33.360
Shouldn't the universe be teeming with spaceships?

00:33.360 --> 00:34.480
Let's take a step back.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.040
Even if there are alien civilizations in other galaxies,

00:45.040 --> 00:47.360
there's no way we'll ever know about them.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.880
Basically, everything outside of our direct galactic neighborhood, the so-called local group,

00:52.880 --> 00:57.200
is pretty much out of our reach forever because of the expansion of the universe.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.320
Even if we had really fast spaceships,

01:00.320 --> 01:03.680
it would literally take billions of years to reach these places,

01:04.560 --> 01:08.000
traveling through the emptiest areas in the universe.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.480
So let's focus on the Milky Way.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.720
The Milky Way is our home galaxy.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.000
It consists of up to 400 billion stars.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.360
That's a lot of stars.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.000
Counting one per second, it would take you 100 lifetimes to count them all.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.760
There are about 20 billion sun-like stars in the Milky Way,

01:25.760 --> 01:30.560
and estimates suggest that a fifth of them have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone,

01:30.560 --> 01:33.600
the area with conditions that enable life to exist.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.200
If only 0.1% of those planets harbored life,

01:37.200 --> 01:41.120
there would be one million planets with life in the Milky Way.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.800
But wait, there's more.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.000
The Milky Way is about 13 billion years old.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.560
In the beginning, it would not have been a good place for life, because things exploded a lot.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.040
But after one to two billion years, the first habitable planets were born.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.480
Earth is only 4 billion years old, so there have probably been

01:58.480 --> 02:02.240
trillions of chances for life to develop on other planets in the past.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.800
If only a single one of them had developed into a space-traveling super-civilization,

02:06.800 --> 02:08.080
we would have noticed by now.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.800
What would such a civilization look like?

02:11.440 --> 02:12.960
There are three categories.

02:13.520 --> 02:19.200
A Type 1 civilization would be able to access the whole energy available on its planet.

02:19.200 --> 02:23.600
In case you're wondering, we're currently around 0.73 on the scale,

02:23.600 --> 02:27.280
and we should reach Type 1 sometime in the next couple of hundred years.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.520
Type 2 would be a civilization capable of harnessing all of the energy of its home star.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.000
This would require some serious science fiction, but it is doable in principle.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.120
Concepts like the Dyson Sphere, a giant complex surrounding the sun, would be conceivable.

02:43.840 --> 02:49.120
Type 3 is a civilization that basically controls its whole galaxy and its energy.

02:49.120 --> 02:53.280
An alien race this advanced would probably be godlike to us.

02:53.280 --> 02:58.000
But why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.680
If we were to build generation spaceships that could sustain a population for around 1,000 years,

03:03.680 --> 03:07.280
we could colonize the whole galaxy in 2 million years.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.600
Sounds like a long time, but remember, the Milky Way is huge.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.520
So if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy,

03:15.520 --> 03:20.960
and there are possibly millions if not billions of planets that sustain life in the Milky Way,

03:20.960 --> 03:25.360
and these other life forms have had considerably more time than we've had,

03:25.360 --> 03:27.600
then where are all the aliens?

03:28.400 --> 03:32.240
This is the Fermi Paradox, and nobody has an answer to it.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.880
But we do have some ideas.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.800
Let's talk about filters.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.680
A filter in this context represents a barrier that is really hard for life to overcome.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.720
They come in various degrees of scary.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.280
One, there are great filters, and we have passed them.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.000
Maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop than we think.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.160
The process allowing life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out,

03:58.160 --> 04:01.120
and the conditions required may be really complicated.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.040
Maybe in the past, the universe was way more hostile,

04:05.040 --> 04:09.200
and only recently have things cooled down to make complex life possible.

04:09.200 --> 04:13.040
This would also mean that we may be unique, or at least one of the first,

04:13.040 --> 04:16.800
if not the first, civilization in the entire universe.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.440
Two, there are great filters, and they are ahead of us.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.760
This one would be really, really bad.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.720
Maybe life on our level exists everywhere in the universe,

04:26.720 --> 04:31.280
but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point, a point that lies ahead of us.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.760
For example, awesome future technology exists, but when activated, it destroys the planet.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.120
The last words of every advanced civilization would be,

04:41.120 --> 04:44.960
this new device will solve all of our problems once I push this button.

04:44.960 --> 04:50.000
If this is true, then we are closer to the end than the beginning of human existence.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.880
Or, maybe there is an ancient type 3 civilization that monitors the universe,

04:54.880 --> 05:00.160
and once civilization is advanced enough, it gets eliminated in an instant.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.880
Maybe there is something out there that it would be better not to discover.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.120
There is no way for us to know.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.080
One final thought, maybe we're alone.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.800
Right now, we have no evidence that there's any life besides us.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.680
Nothing.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.720
The universe appears to be empty and dead.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.920
No one sending us messages, no one answering our calls.

05:21.920 --> 05:28.080
We may be completely alone, trapped on a tiny moist mud ball in an eternal universe.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.600
Does that thought scare you?

05:29.600 --> 05:32.080
If it does, you're having the correct emotional reaction.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.760
If we let life on this planet die, perhaps there will be no life left in the universe.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.080
Life will be gone maybe forever.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.040
If this is the case, we just have to venture to the stars

05:43.040 --> 05:47.440
and become the first type 3 civilization to keep the delicate flame of life existing

05:47.440 --> 05:52.560
and to spread it until the universe breathes its final breath and vanishes into oblivion.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.400
The universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.960
This video was made possible by your support.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.880
It takes at least 200 hours to make one of our videos,

06:04.880 --> 06:09.840
and thanks to your contributions on Patreon, we are slowly able to do more and more of them.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.000
If you want to help us out, and get your own personal bird for example,
