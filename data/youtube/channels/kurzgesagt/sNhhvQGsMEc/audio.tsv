0	3840	Are we the only living things in the entire universe?
3840	8560	The observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter.
8560	15280	There are at least 100 billion galaxies, each with 100 to 1,000 billion stars.
15280	19040	Recently, we've learned that planets are very common too.
19040	23840	And there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe,
23840	29040	which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist, right?
29040	30320	But where is it?
30320	33360	Shouldn't the universe be teeming with spaceships?
33360	34480	Let's take a step back.
41360	45040	Even if there are alien civilizations in other galaxies,
45040	47360	there's no way we'll ever know about them.
47360	52880	Basically, everything outside of our direct galactic neighborhood, the so-called local group,
52880	57200	is pretty much out of our reach forever because of the expansion of the universe.
57840	60320	Even if we had really fast spaceships,
60320	63680	it would literally take billions of years to reach these places,
64560	68000	traveling through the emptiest areas in the universe.
68000	70480	So let's focus on the Milky Way.
70480	72720	The Milky Way is our home galaxy.
72720	76000	It consists of up to 400 billion stars.
76000	77360	That's a lot of stars.
77360	82000	Counting one per second, it would take you 100 lifetimes to count them all.
82000	85760	There are about 20 billion sun-like stars in the Milky Way,
85760	90560	and estimates suggest that a fifth of them have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone,
90560	93600	the area with conditions that enable life to exist.
93600	97200	If only 0.1% of those planets harbored life,
97200	101120	there would be one million planets with life in the Milky Way.
101120	102800	But wait, there's more.
102800	106000	The Milky Way is about 13 billion years old.
106000	110560	In the beginning, it would not have been a good place for life, because things exploded a lot.
110560	115040	But after one to two billion years, the first habitable planets were born.
115040	118480	Earth is only 4 billion years old, so there have probably been
118480	122240	trillions of chances for life to develop on other planets in the past.
122240	126800	If only a single one of them had developed into a space-traveling super-civilization,
126800	128080	we would have noticed by now.
128640	130800	What would such a civilization look like?
131440	132960	There are three categories.
133520	139200	A Type 1 civilization would be able to access the whole energy available on its planet.
139200	143600	In case you're wondering, we're currently around 0.73 on the scale,
143600	147280	and we should reach Type 1 sometime in the next couple of hundred years.
147920	153520	Type 2 would be a civilization capable of harnessing all of the energy of its home star.
153520	158000	This would require some serious science fiction, but it is doable in principle.
158000	163120	Concepts like the Dyson Sphere, a giant complex surrounding the sun, would be conceivable.
163840	169120	Type 3 is a civilization that basically controls its whole galaxy and its energy.
169120	173280	An alien race this advanced would probably be godlike to us.
173280	178000	But why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place?
178000	183680	If we were to build generation spaceships that could sustain a population for around 1,000 years,
183680	187280	we could colonize the whole galaxy in 2 million years.
187280	191600	Sounds like a long time, but remember, the Milky Way is huge.
191600	195520	So if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy,
195520	200960	and there are possibly millions if not billions of planets that sustain life in the Milky Way,
200960	205360	and these other life forms have had considerably more time than we've had,
205360	207600	then where are all the aliens?
208400	212240	This is the Fermi Paradox, and nobody has an answer to it.
212800	214880	But we do have some ideas.
214880	216800	Let's talk about filters.
216800	221680	A filter in this context represents a barrier that is really hard for life to overcome.
222320	224720	They come in various degrees of scary.
225280	229280	One, there are great filters, and we have passed them.
229840	234000	Maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop than we think.
234000	238160	The process allowing life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out,
238160	241120	and the conditions required may be really complicated.
241680	245040	Maybe in the past, the universe was way more hostile,
245040	249200	and only recently have things cooled down to make complex life possible.
249200	253040	This would also mean that we may be unique, or at least one of the first,
253040	256800	if not the first, civilization in the entire universe.
257520	261440	Two, there are great filters, and they are ahead of us.
261440	263760	This one would be really, really bad.
263760	266720	Maybe life on our level exists everywhere in the universe,
266720	271280	but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point, a point that lies ahead of us.
272000	277760	For example, awesome future technology exists, but when activated, it destroys the planet.
277760	281120	The last words of every advanced civilization would be,
281120	284960	this new device will solve all of our problems once I push this button.
284960	290000	If this is true, then we are closer to the end than the beginning of human existence.
290000	294880	Or, maybe there is an ancient type 3 civilization that monitors the universe,
294880	300160	and once civilization is advanced enough, it gets eliminated in an instant.
300800	304880	Maybe there is something out there that it would be better not to discover.
305600	307120	There is no way for us to know.
307760	310080	One final thought, maybe we're alone.
310640	314800	Right now, we have no evidence that there's any life besides us.
314880	315680	Nothing.
315680	318720	The universe appears to be empty and dead.
318720	321920	No one sending us messages, no one answering our calls.
321920	328080	We may be completely alone, trapped on a tiny moist mud ball in an eternal universe.
328080	329600	Does that thought scare you?
329600	332080	If it does, you're having the correct emotional reaction.
332720	337760	If we let life on this planet die, perhaps there will be no life left in the universe.
337760	340080	Life will be gone maybe forever.
340080	343040	If this is the case, we just have to venture to the stars
343040	347440	and become the first type 3 civilization to keep the delicate flame of life existing
347440	352560	and to spread it until the universe breathes its final breath and vanishes into oblivion.
352560	356400	The universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone.
