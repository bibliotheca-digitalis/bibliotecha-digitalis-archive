1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Are we the only living things in the entire universe?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,560
The observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,280
There are at least 100 billion galaxies, each with 100 to 1,000 billion stars.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,040
Recently, we've learned that planets are very common too.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,840
And there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe,

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,040
which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist, right?

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,320
But where is it?

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,360
Shouldn't the universe be teeming with spaceships?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,480
Let's take a step back.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,040
Even if there are alien civilizations in other galaxies,

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,360
there's no way we'll ever know about them.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,880
Basically, everything outside of our direct galactic neighborhood, the so-called local group,

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,200
is pretty much out of our reach forever because of the expansion of the universe.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Even if we had really fast spaceships,

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
it would literally take billions of years to reach these places,

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,000
traveling through the emptiest areas in the universe.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,480
So let's focus on the Milky Way.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,720
The Milky Way is our home galaxy.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,000
It consists of up to 400 billion stars.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,360
That's a lot of stars.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,000
Counting one per second, it would take you 100 lifetimes to count them all.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,760
There are about 20 billion sun-like stars in the Milky Way,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,560
and estimates suggest that a fifth of them have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone,

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
the area with conditions that enable life to exist.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,200
If only 0.1% of those planets harbored life,

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,120
there would be one million planets with life in the Milky Way.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,800
But wait, there's more.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,000
The Milky Way is about 13 billion years old.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,560
In the beginning, it would not have been a good place for life, because things exploded a lot.

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
But after one to two billion years, the first habitable planets were born.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Earth is only 4 billion years old, so there have probably been

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,240
trillions of chances for life to develop on other planets in the past.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,800
If only a single one of them had developed into a space-traveling super-civilization,

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
we would have noticed by now.

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,800
What would such a civilization look like?

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,960
There are three categories.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,200
A Type 1 civilization would be able to access the whole energy available on its planet.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,600
In case you're wondering, we're currently around 0.73 on the scale,

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,280
and we should reach Type 1 sometime in the next couple of hundred years.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,520
Type 2 would be a civilization capable of harnessing all of the energy of its home star.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,000
This would require some serious science fiction, but it is doable in principle.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
Concepts like the Dyson Sphere, a giant complex surrounding the sun, would be conceivable.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,120
Type 3 is a civilization that basically controls its whole galaxy and its energy.

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,280
An alien race this advanced would probably be godlike to us.

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,000
But why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,680
If we were to build generation spaceships that could sustain a population for around 1,000 years,

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
we could colonize the whole galaxy in 2 million years.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,600
Sounds like a long time, but remember, the Milky Way is huge.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,520
So if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy,

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,960
and there are possibly millions if not billions of planets that sustain life in the Milky Way,

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,360
and these other life forms have had considerably more time than we've had,

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,600
then where are all the aliens?

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,240
This is the Fermi Paradox, and nobody has an answer to it.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,880
But we do have some ideas.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,800
Let's talk about filters.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,680
A filter in this context represents a barrier that is really hard for life to overcome.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,720
They come in various degrees of scary.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
One, there are great filters, and we have passed them.

59
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop than we think.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,160
The process allowing life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out,

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,120
and the conditions required may be really complicated.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
Maybe in the past, the universe was way more hostile,

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
and only recently have things cooled down to make complex life possible.

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,040
This would also mean that we may be unique, or at least one of the first,

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,800
if not the first, civilization in the entire universe.

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,440
Two, there are great filters, and they are ahead of us.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,760
This one would be really, really bad.

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,720
Maybe life on our level exists everywhere in the universe,

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,280
but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point, a point that lies ahead of us.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,760
For example, awesome future technology exists, but when activated, it destroys the planet.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,120
The last words of every advanced civilization would be,

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
this new device will solve all of our problems once I push this button.

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
If this is true, then we are closer to the end than the beginning of human existence.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,880
Or, maybe there is an ancient type 3 civilization that monitors the universe,

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,160
and once civilization is advanced enough, it gets eliminated in an instant.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
Maybe there is something out there that it would be better not to discover.

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
There is no way for us to know.

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,080
One final thought, maybe we're alone.

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,800
Right now, we have no evidence that there's any life besides us.

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Nothing.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
The universe appears to be empty and dead.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,920
No one sending us messages, no one answering our calls.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,080
We may be completely alone, trapped on a tiny moist mud ball in an eternal universe.

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Does that thought scare you?

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
If it does, you're having the correct emotional reaction.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,760
If we let life on this planet die, perhaps there will be no life left in the universe.

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,080
Life will be gone maybe forever.

88
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,040
If this is the case, we just have to venture to the stars

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,440
and become the first type 3 civilization to keep the delicate flame of life existing

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,560
and to spread it until the universe breathes its final breath and vanishes into oblivion.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
The universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone.

92
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,960
This video was made possible by your support.

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,880

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,840
and thanks to your contributions on Patreon, we are slowly able to do more and more of them.
