00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
What is the largest star in the universe? And why is it that large? And what are stars anyway?

00:07.240 --> 00:14.760
Things that would like to be stars. We begin our journey with Earth, not to learn anything,

00:14.760 --> 00:20.800
just to get a vague sense of scale. The smallest things that have some star-like properties are

00:20.800 --> 00:27.480
large gas giants or sub-brown dwarfs. Like Jupiter, the most massive planet in the solar system.

00:27.480 --> 00:34.600
11 times larger and 317 times more massive than Earth and more or less made of the same stuff as

00:34.600 --> 00:41.960
our Sun. Just much much less of it. The transition towards stars begins with brown dwarfs, failed

00:41.960 --> 00:48.640
stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums. They have between 13 and 90 times the mass

00:48.640 --> 00:54.560
of Jupiter. So even if we took 90 Jupiters and threw them at each other, although fun to watch,

00:54.560 --> 01:00.560
it wouldn't be enough to create a star. Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown

01:00.560 --> 01:07.240
dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser. This increases the pressure in

01:07.240 --> 01:12.720
the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion reactions happen slowly and the object glow a

01:12.720 --> 01:19.600
little. So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant that don't fit into any category very well.

01:19.640 --> 01:25.040
But we want to talk about stars, not failed wannabe stars, so let's move on.

01:25.040 --> 01:34.120
Main sequence stars. Once large gas balls pass a certain mass threshold, their cores become hot and

01:34.120 --> 01:41.240
dense enough to ignite. Hydrogen is fused to helium in their cores, releasing tremendous

01:41.240 --> 01:47.560
amounts of energy. Stars that do that are called main sequence stars. The more massive a main

01:47.600 --> 01:53.360
sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns and the shorter its life is. Once the

01:53.360 --> 01:59.880
hydrogen burning phase is over, stars grow up to hundreds of thousands of times their original

01:59.880 --> 02:06.760
size. But these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan. So we'll be

02:06.760 --> 02:12.120
comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives. This doesn't make them less

02:12.160 --> 02:17.400
impressive, but maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.

02:17.400 --> 02:24.920
Now back to the beginning. The smallest real stars are red dwarfs, about 100 times the mass

02:24.920 --> 02:30.920
of Jupiter, barely massive enough to fuse hydrogen to helium. Because they are not very massive,

02:30.920 --> 02:37.160
they are small, not very hot, and shine pretty dimly. They are the only stars in the main

02:37.200 --> 02:44.360
sequence that don't grow once they die, but sort of fizzle out. Red dwarfs are by far the most

02:44.360 --> 02:50.800
abundant type in the universe. Because they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to 10

02:50.800 --> 02:57.080
trillion years, a thousand times the current age of the universe. For example, one of the

02:57.080 --> 03:02.880
closest stars to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard star, but it shines too dimly to be seen

03:02.880 --> 03:08.920
without a telescope. We made a whole video on red dwarfs if you want to learn more. The next stage

03:08.920 --> 03:15.440
are stars like our Sun. To say the Sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice, since

03:15.440 --> 03:23.960
it makes up 99.86% of all its mass. It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs, which reduces

03:23.960 --> 03:29.840
its lifetime to about 10 billion years. The Sun is seven times more massive than Barnard star,

03:29.880 --> 03:37.000
but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter with twice its surface temperature. Let's go bigger.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.560
Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's brightness. The brightest

03:44.560 --> 03:51.000
star in the night sky, Sirius, is two solar masses with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun,

03:51.000 --> 03:58.800
but its surface is nearly 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it shine 25 times brighter. Burning that

03:58.800 --> 04:06.960
hot reduces its total lifespan by four times to 2.5 billion years. Stars close to 10 times

04:06.960 --> 04:14.360
the mass of our Sun have surface temperatures near 25,000 degrees Celsius. Beta Centauri contains two

04:14.360 --> 04:20.520
of these massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times the power of the Sun. That's a lot

04:20.520 --> 04:26.080
of power coming from something only 13 times larger, but they'll only burn for about 20

04:26.080 --> 04:32.400
million years. Entire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the Sun to orbit

04:32.400 --> 04:40.880
the galaxy once. So is this the formula? The more massive, the larger the star. The most massive

04:40.880 --> 04:49.200
star that we know is R136A1. It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times brighter

04:49.240 --> 04:55.920
than the Sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power, it's barely 30 times the size

04:55.920 --> 05:04.360
of the Sun. The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses 321,000 billion

05:04.360 --> 05:11.600
tons of material through its stellar wind. Every single second. Stars of this sort are extremely

05:11.600 --> 05:17.120
rare because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit. When supermassive stars

05:17.160 --> 05:22.960
are born, they burn extremely hot and bright, and this blows away any extra gas that could make them

05:22.960 --> 05:31.640
more massive. So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the Sun. Stars like R136A1

05:31.640 --> 05:36.760
are probably formed through the merger of several high-mass stars in dense star forming regions and

05:36.760 --> 05:43.800
burn their core hydrogen in only a few million years. So this means they are rare and short-lived.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.080
From here, the trick to going bigger isn't adding more mass. To make the biggest stars,

05:50.080 --> 05:58.160
we have to kill them. Red giants. When main sequence stars begin to exhaust the hydrogen

05:58.160 --> 06:04.800
in their core, it contracts, making it hotter and denser. This leads to hotter and faster fusion,

06:04.800 --> 06:11.480
which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a giant phase. And these

06:11.520 --> 06:19.440
stars become truly giant indeed. For example, Gakrax. Only 30% more massive than the Sun,

06:19.440 --> 06:26.080
it has swollen to about 84 times its radius. Still, when the Sun enters the last stage of

06:26.080 --> 06:33.640
its life, it will swell and become even bigger. 200 times its current radius. In this final phase

06:33.640 --> 06:39.360
of its life, it will swallow the inner planets. And if you think that's impressive, let's finally

06:39.360 --> 06:46.280
introduce the largest stars in the universe, hypergiants. Hypergiants are the giant phase

06:46.280 --> 06:52.840
of the most massive stars in the universe. They have an enormous surface area that can radiate

06:52.840 --> 06:58.560
an insane amount of light. Being so large, they're basically blowing themselves apart,

06:58.560 --> 07:05.320
as gravity at the surface is too weak to hold on to the hot mass, which is lifted away in powerful

07:05.320 --> 07:12.960
stellar winds. Pistol Star is 25 solar masses, but 300 times the radius of the Sun, a blue

07:12.960 --> 07:19.200
hypergiant aptly named for its energetic blue starlight. It's hard to say exactly how long

07:19.200 --> 07:24.720
Pistol Star will live, but probably just a few million years. Even larger than the blue

07:24.720 --> 07:29.760
hypergiants are the yellow hypergiants. The most well-studied is Rho Cassiopeia,

07:29.760 --> 07:35.000
a star so bright it can be seen with the naked eye, although it's thousands of light years from

07:35.000 --> 07:41.440
Earth. At 40 solar masses, this star is around 500 times the radius of the Sun,

07:41.440 --> 07:48.440
and 500,000 times brighter. If the Earth were as close to Rho Cassiopeia as it is to the Sun,

07:48.440 --> 07:55.560
it'd be inside it, and you would be very dead. Yellow hypergiants are very rare though,

07:55.560 --> 08:02.880
only 15 are known. This means they're likely just a short-lived intermediate state, as a star grows

08:02.920 --> 08:08.480
or shrinks between other phases of hypergiantness. With red hypergiants,

08:08.480 --> 08:14.840
we reach the largest stars known to us, probably the largest stars even possible. So,

08:14.840 --> 08:23.120
who's the winner of this insane contest? Well, the truth is, we don't know. Red hypergiants

08:23.120 --> 08:28.800
are extremely bright and far away, which means that even tiny uncertainties in our measurements

08:28.800 --> 08:35.160
can give us a huge margin of error for their size. Worse still, red hypergiants are solar

08:35.160 --> 08:41.440
system-sized behemoths that are blowing themselves apart, which makes them harder to measure. As we

08:41.440 --> 08:46.720
do more science and our instruments improve, whatever the largest star is will change.

08:46.720 --> 08:53.560
The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we've found is Stevenson 218. It was

08:53.560 --> 08:59.080
probably born as a main sequence star a few tens of times the mass of the Sun and has likely lost

08:59.080 --> 09:06.320
about half its mass by now. While typical red hypergiants are 1,500 times the size of the Sun,

09:06.320 --> 09:15.280
the largest rough estimate places Stevenson 218 at 2,150 solar radii and shining with almost half

09:15.280 --> 09:23.240
a million times the power of the Sun. By comparison, the Sun seems like a grain of dust. Our brains

09:23.420 --> 09:29.040
don't really have a way of grasping this kind of scale. Even at light speed, it would take you

09:29.040 --> 09:37.120
8.7 hours to travel around at once. The fastest plane on Earth would take around 500 years. Dropped

09:37.120 --> 09:44.400
on the Sun, it would fill Saturn's orbit. As it evolves, it will probably shed even more mass and

09:44.400 --> 09:50.720
shrink down into another hotter hypergiant phase, accumulate heavy elements in its core before

09:50.720 --> 09:58.520
finally exploding in a core collapse supernova, giving its gas back to the galaxy. This gas will

09:58.520 --> 10:05.360
then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes, starting the cycle of birth and death

10:05.360 --> 10:12.440
again to light up our universe. Let's make this journey again, but this time without the talking.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.960
The universe is big. There are many large things in it.

10:34.960 --> 10:42.160
If you want to play a bit more with science stuff, we have good news. We've created our

10:42.200 --> 10:48.620
first app, Universe in a Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the brain behind Wait But Why. You can

10:48.620 --> 10:53.360
seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells,

10:53.360 --> 10:59.720
and dinosaurs, all the way to the largest stars and galaxies, and marvel at the whole observable

10:59.720 --> 11:06.600
universe. You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. The

11:06.600 --> 11:11.320
app is inspired by the Scale of the Universe website by the Huang twins that we spent a lot

11:11.320 --> 11:15.720
of time with when it came out years ago, and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait

11:15.720 --> 11:21.200
But Why and Kurzgesagt version. You can get it in your app store, there are no in-app purchases and

11:21.200 --> 11:27.580
no ads. All future updates are included. And since this is our first app, we'd love to hear your

11:27.580 --> 11:33.080
feedback so we can improve it over time. If this sounds good to you, download the Universe in a

11:33.080 --> 11:38.760
Nutshell app now and leave us a five-star review if you want to support it. Kurzgesagt and all the

11:38.760 --> 11:45.040
projects we do are mostly funded by viewers like you. So if you like the app, we'll make

11:45.040 --> 11:48.160
more digital things in future. Thank you for watching.
