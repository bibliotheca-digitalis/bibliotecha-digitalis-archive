0	7240	What is the largest star in the universe? And why is it that large? And what are stars anyway?
7240	14760	Things that would like to be stars. We begin our journey with Earth, not to learn anything,
14760	20800	just to get a vague sense of scale. The smallest things that have some star-like properties are
20800	27480	large gas giants or sub-brown dwarfs. Like Jupiter, the most massive planet in the solar system.
27480	34600	11 times larger and 317 times more massive than Earth and more or less made of the same stuff as
34600	41960	our Sun. Just much much less of it. The transition towards stars begins with brown dwarfs, failed
41960	48640	stars that are a huge disappointment to their mums. They have between 13 and 90 times the mass
48640	54560	of Jupiter. So even if we took 90 Jupiters and threw them at each other, although fun to watch,
54560	60560	it wouldn't be enough to create a star. Interestingly, adding lots of mass to a brown
60560	67240	dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser. This increases the pressure in
67240	72720	the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion reactions happen slowly and the object glow a
72720	79600	little. So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy gas giant that don't fit into any category very well.
79640	85040	But we want to talk about stars, not failed wannabe stars, so let's move on.
85040	94120	Main sequence stars. Once large gas balls pass a certain mass threshold, their cores become hot and
94120	101240	dense enough to ignite. Hydrogen is fused to helium in their cores, releasing tremendous
101240	107560	amounts of energy. Stars that do that are called main sequence stars. The more massive a main
107600	113360	sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns and the shorter its life is. Once the
113360	119880	hydrogen burning phase is over, stars grow up to hundreds of thousands of times their original
119880	126760	size. But these giant phases only last for a fraction of their lifespan. So we'll be
126760	132120	comparing stars at drastically different stages in their lives. This doesn't make them less
132160	137400	impressive, but maybe it's good to keep in mind that we'll be comparing babies to adults.
137400	144920	Now back to the beginning. The smallest real stars are red dwarfs, about 100 times the mass
144920	150920	of Jupiter, barely massive enough to fuse hydrogen to helium. Because they are not very massive,
150920	157160	they are small, not very hot, and shine pretty dimly. They are the only stars in the main
157200	164360	sequence that don't grow once they die, but sort of fizzle out. Red dwarfs are by far the most
164360	170800	abundant type in the universe. Because they burn their fuel very slowly, it lasts them up to 10
170800	177080	trillion years, a thousand times the current age of the universe. For example, one of the
177080	182880	closest stars to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard star, but it shines too dimly to be seen
182880	188920	without a telescope. We made a whole video on red dwarfs if you want to learn more. The next stage
188920	195440	are stars like our Sun. To say the Sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice, since
195440	203960	it makes up 99.86% of all its mass. It burns far hotter and brighter than red dwarfs, which reduces
203960	209840	its lifetime to about 10 billion years. The Sun is seven times more massive than Barnard star,
209880	217000	but that makes it nearly 300 times brighter with twice its surface temperature. Let's go bigger.
217000	224560	Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's brightness. The brightest
224560	231000	star in the night sky, Sirius, is two solar masses with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun,
231000	238800	but its surface is nearly 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it shine 25 times brighter. Burning that
238800	246960	hot reduces its total lifespan by four times to 2.5 billion years. Stars close to 10 times
246960	254360	the mass of our Sun have surface temperatures near 25,000 degrees Celsius. Beta Centauri contains two
254360	260520	of these massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times the power of the Sun. That's a lot
260520	266080	of power coming from something only 13 times larger, but they'll only burn for about 20
266080	272400	million years. Entire generations of these blue stars die in the time it takes the Sun to orbit
272400	280880	the galaxy once. So is this the formula? The more massive, the larger the star. The most massive
280880	289200	star that we know is R136A1. It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times brighter
289240	295920	than the Sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass and power, it's barely 30 times the size
295920	304360	of the Sun. The star is so extreme and barely held together by gravity that it loses 321,000 billion
304360	311600	tons of material through its stellar wind. Every single second. Stars of this sort are extremely
311600	317120	rare because they break the rules of star formation a tiny bit. When supermassive stars
317160	322960	are born, they burn extremely hot and bright, and this blows away any extra gas that could make them
322960	331640	more massive. So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the Sun. Stars like R136A1
331640	336760	are probably formed through the merger of several high-mass stars in dense star forming regions and
336760	343800	burn their core hydrogen in only a few million years. So this means they are rare and short-lived.
344000	350080	From here, the trick to going bigger isn't adding more mass. To make the biggest stars,
350080	358160	we have to kill them. Red giants. When main sequence stars begin to exhaust the hydrogen
358160	364800	in their core, it contracts, making it hotter and denser. This leads to hotter and faster fusion,
364800	371480	which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a giant phase. And these
371520	379440	stars become truly giant indeed. For example, Gakrax. Only 30% more massive than the Sun,
379440	386080	it has swollen to about 84 times its radius. Still, when the Sun enters the last stage of
386080	393640	its life, it will swell and become even bigger. 200 times its current radius. In this final phase
393640	399360	of its life, it will swallow the inner planets. And if you think that's impressive, let's finally
399360	406280	introduce the largest stars in the universe, hypergiants. Hypergiants are the giant phase
406280	412840	of the most massive stars in the universe. They have an enormous surface area that can radiate
412840	418560	an insane amount of light. Being so large, they're basically blowing themselves apart,
418560	425320	as gravity at the surface is too weak to hold on to the hot mass, which is lifted away in powerful
425320	432960	stellar winds. Pistol Star is 25 solar masses, but 300 times the radius of the Sun, a blue
432960	439200	hypergiant aptly named for its energetic blue starlight. It's hard to say exactly how long
439200	444720	Pistol Star will live, but probably just a few million years. Even larger than the blue
444720	449760	hypergiants are the yellow hypergiants. The most well-studied is Rho Cassiopeia,
449760	455000	a star so bright it can be seen with the naked eye, although it's thousands of light years from
455000	461440	Earth. At 40 solar masses, this star is around 500 times the radius of the Sun,
461440	468440	and 500,000 times brighter. If the Earth were as close to Rho Cassiopeia as it is to the Sun,
468440	475560	it'd be inside it, and you would be very dead. Yellow hypergiants are very rare though,
475560	482880	only 15 are known. This means they're likely just a short-lived intermediate state, as a star grows
482920	488480	or shrinks between other phases of hypergiantness. With red hypergiants,
488480	494840	we reach the largest stars known to us, probably the largest stars even possible. So,
494840	503120	who's the winner of this insane contest? Well, the truth is, we don't know. Red hypergiants
503120	508800	are extremely bright and far away, which means that even tiny uncertainties in our measurements
508800	515160	can give us a huge margin of error for their size. Worse still, red hypergiants are solar
515160	521440	system-sized behemoths that are blowing themselves apart, which makes them harder to measure. As we
521440	526720	do more science and our instruments improve, whatever the largest star is will change.
526720	533560	The star that is currently thought to be among the largest we've found is Stevenson 218. It was
533560	539080	probably born as a main sequence star a few tens of times the mass of the Sun and has likely lost
539080	546320	about half its mass by now. While typical red hypergiants are 1,500 times the size of the Sun,
546320	555280	the largest rough estimate places Stevenson 218 at 2,150 solar radii and shining with almost half
555280	563240	a million times the power of the Sun. By comparison, the Sun seems like a grain of dust. Our brains
563420	569040	don't really have a way of grasping this kind of scale. Even at light speed, it would take you
569040	577120	8.7 hours to travel around at once. The fastest plane on Earth would take around 500 years. Dropped
577120	584400	on the Sun, it would fill Saturn's orbit. As it evolves, it will probably shed even more mass and
584400	590720	shrink down into another hotter hypergiant phase, accumulate heavy elements in its core before
590720	598520	finally exploding in a core collapse supernova, giving its gas back to the galaxy. This gas will
598520	605360	then go on to form another generation of stars of all sizes, starting the cycle of birth and death
605360	612440	again to light up our universe. Let's make this journey again, but this time without the talking.
612960	616960	The universe is big. There are many large things in it.
634960	642160	If you want to play a bit more with science stuff, we have good news. We've created our
642200	648620	first app, Universe in a Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the brain behind Wait But Why. You can
648620	653360	seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells,
653360	659720	and dinosaurs, all the way to the largest stars and galaxies, and marvel at the whole observable
659720	666600	universe. You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. The
666600	671320	app is inspired by the Scale of the Universe website by the Huang twins that we spent a lot
671320	675720	of time with when it came out years ago, and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait
675720	681200	But Why and Kurzgesagt version. You can get it in your app store, there are no in-app purchases and
681200	687580	no ads. All future updates are included. And since this is our first app, we'd love to hear your
687580	693080	feedback so we can improve it over time. If this sounds good to you, download the Universe in a
693080	698760	Nutshell app now and leave us a five-star review if you want to support it. Kurzgesagt and all the
698760	705040	projects we do are mostly funded by viewers like you. So if you like the app, we'll make
705040	708160	more digital things in future. Thank you for watching.
