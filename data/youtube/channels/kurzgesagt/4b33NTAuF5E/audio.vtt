00:00.720 --> 00:06.480
The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our first stories.

00:07.040 --> 00:14.000
We exist in an endless universe, only bound by the laws of physics, and yet our consciousness

00:14.000 --> 00:20.320
is trapped in mortal machines made of meat. With the breathtaking explosion of innovation

00:20.320 --> 00:26.800
and progress, for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our

00:26.800 --> 00:34.080
minds into a digital utopia seems possible, even like the logical next step on our revolutionary

00:34.080 --> 00:40.880
ladder. Mind uploading and digital immortality are some of the core themes of the game Cyberpunk

00:40.880 --> 00:47.520
2077. It plays in a grim dystopian future where humanity has progressed far beyond today's

00:47.520 --> 00:54.240
technology and explores what this could mean for humanity. About a year ago, CD Projekt Red asked

00:54.240 --> 00:58.800
us if we would like to make a video about some of these ideas and we were immediately on board.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.520
So, let's explore this topic together. Is it possible to upload your mind into a computer?

01:06.320 --> 01:08.400
Well, it's complicated.

01:17.200 --> 01:23.360
Upload what exactly? Mind is one of those words that are really hard to define.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.400
It's thought to be the collective abilities of your consciousness and intelligence, the thing

01:28.400 --> 01:35.040
that lets you imagine, recognize, and dream. Mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making

01:35.040 --> 01:40.480
a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your

01:40.480 --> 01:47.440
consciousness. But even defining the premise gets really hard, really fast. The possibility of mind

01:47.440 --> 01:54.400
uploading is based on three assumptions. Assumption 1. Your mind is in your brain's

01:54.400 --> 02:00.240
structure, arrangement, and biochemistry. The idea that everything about the mind can be found

02:00.240 --> 02:05.680
in the brain is called physicalism and it keeps our discussion within the domain of natural law.

02:06.960 --> 02:13.280
Assumption 2. At some point, we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology

02:13.280 --> 02:16.960
to simulate all of its aspects to make a digital mind copy.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.960
Assumption 3. Computer software can host your mind, which means the mind is computable.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.440
There is no physical property in the brain, including consciousness,

02:29.440 --> 02:33.360
that cannot be simulated accurately even if it requires a lot of code.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.800
All of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and philosophers

02:38.800 --> 02:44.000
and they remain the subject of passionate debate. With so many fundamental questions

02:44.000 --> 02:47.840
still unanswered, it's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone.

02:48.800 --> 02:53.680
Whatever your position, every discussion of mind upload has to begin with the brain.

02:54.800 --> 03:01.120
The brain in a nutshell. The brain is the most complex biological structure known

03:01.120 --> 03:05.440
and deserves its own entire video, so let's just take a brief look at it.

03:06.320 --> 03:12.240
Around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion connections that are sending

03:12.240 --> 03:18.240
signals up to 1000 times each second, which is 1 quadrillion events every second of your

03:18.240 --> 03:24.640
waking life. And it's not just neurons, there are billions of supporting and immune cells

03:24.640 --> 03:29.760
of various types performing different jobs. On a macro level, the brain can be divided

03:29.760 --> 03:34.160
in two sections with different roles, from breathing and heart rate, to coordinating

03:34.800 --> 03:40.720
movement and involuntary reflexes. The most developed parts, the neocortex,

03:40.720 --> 03:46.400
or the outermost layer of the brain, hold memories, our ability to plan, think and imagine,

03:46.400 --> 03:52.880
hope and dream. Where exactly the you part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.480
We know that areas like the precuneus cortex have the greatest influence on our consciousness,

03:58.480 --> 04:03.520
but also that several areas can network together to share tasks none of them can do alone.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.360
The brain's building blocks are not exactly simple either.

04:08.160 --> 04:14.960
Neurons are not just wires, they alter and process information. Synapses, where signals are handed

04:14.960 --> 04:19.840
over from one neuron to the next, contain receptors for hundreds of chemical signals,

04:19.840 --> 04:25.120
opening them up to outside influence. We have a basic understanding of how these work,

04:25.120 --> 04:30.000
and we can accurately predict their behavior at small scales, but there's a lot more to the brain

04:30.080 --> 04:36.400
than just nerve signals. Hormones play a huge role, like serotonin, which affects our mood,

04:36.400 --> 04:42.080
or histamine, which helps us learn. The brain is influenced by our other parts too,

04:42.080 --> 04:47.600
from heart nerves to gut bacteria. What seemed like a very complicated system to begin with

04:47.600 --> 04:53.280
gets even more complicated the more we learn about it. To get this wildly interconnected mess

04:53.280 --> 04:58.320
of cells and meat and chemicals into a computer, we need a model that we can simulate in our

04:58.320 --> 05:05.680
digital world. Some sort of scan. Unfortunately, our scanning technology, like fMRI machines,

05:05.680 --> 05:10.640
is not nearly good enough to attempt such a thing. But there is a different method that seems very

05:10.640 --> 05:16.320
promising. Cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution electron

05:16.320 --> 05:23.440
microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and connections. In 2019, scientists

05:23.440 --> 05:28.720
successfully mapped a cubic millimeter of mouse brain, roughly the size of a big grain of sand.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.760
It contained 100,000 neurons with a billion synapses and four kilometers of nerve fibers.

05:36.960 --> 05:44.480
This grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices. Five electron microscopes ran continuously for

05:44.480 --> 05:49.920
five months, collecting more than 100 million images. It took three months to assemble the

05:49.920 --> 05:56.880
images into a 3D model. The completed data set fills up 2 million gigabytes of cloud storage.

05:57.760 --> 06:02.400
To scan a whole human brain, we would have to repeat this effort a million times,

06:02.400 --> 06:07.840
which is much easier said than done. Even worse, to correctly simulate a brain,

06:07.840 --> 06:11.920
we might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the billions of

06:11.920 --> 06:18.240
underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the behaviors we see at the cellular

06:18.240 --> 06:23.920
level, which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on earth.

06:25.840 --> 06:32.800
Brain water to consciousness wine. While all of these issues are annoying, the real question

06:32.800 --> 06:39.040
is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an active thing. Even if we have a scan,

06:39.040 --> 06:44.160
down to the level of synapses, we need laws and rules that animate the wiring diagram.

06:44.160 --> 06:49.520
To endow this static structure with life, update it with the various laws of chemical binding

06:49.520 --> 06:56.480
of electrodynamics to animate the simulation. So it becomes a dynamic active thing like a brain

06:56.480 --> 07:02.320
that exists from one microsecond to the next that could evolve in time, think, see, and act.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.960
The reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve.

07:07.920 --> 07:14.960
If our technology can give rise to real minds. It all hinges on the nature of the problem.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.240
Are the brain and mind just complicated and a lot of work to figure out,

07:20.800 --> 07:27.440
or are they complex in a way that we can't solve? In the worst case, consciousness is more than the

07:27.440 --> 07:33.360
sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we don't realize yet. Complex in a way that we can't

07:33.360 --> 07:39.920
solve by getting better scans. Just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a

07:39.920 --> 07:46.400
good consciousness cake. Right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results

07:46.400 --> 07:52.880
and an end goal, but the road to true simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation and

07:52.880 --> 08:01.040
research. Humans have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress. In the best

08:01.040 --> 08:06.000
case, it's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right solutions. It might not be

08:06.000 --> 08:11.600
necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom. Instead, it may be possible to

08:11.600 --> 08:17.600
simplify elements into probabilistic models that could match the behavior of the brain using a more

08:17.600 --> 08:23.760
manageable number of simpler systems. So we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain

08:23.760 --> 08:30.640
and consciousness well enough to upload human minds, but the science is real and worth pursuing.

08:30.640 --> 08:35.520
At the very least, we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new technologies.

08:36.160 --> 08:41.200
If we succeed, this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly

08:41.200 --> 08:47.760
progressing computer technology. The consequences for humanity and our future in this universe

08:47.760 --> 08:56.880
are vast, creepy, and amazing. The copy. Successful mind uploading is functional

08:56.880 --> 09:03.040
immortality. Unless damaged or deleted, you will continue to exist as long as a copy is stored

09:03.040 --> 09:09.120
somewhere. Of course, if the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways, your mind might get

09:09.120 --> 09:15.680
corrupted too. You might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic

09:15.680 --> 09:22.800
breakdown. The question if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms. For now, we'll

09:22.800 --> 09:29.440
just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you. How would mind uploading change

09:29.440 --> 09:36.320
your outlook on life? Will you feel safer knowing that death is not necessarily the end? Or would

09:36.320 --> 09:42.880
you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded? If scanning technology

09:42.880 --> 09:50.720
does become advanced enough, your biological and digital versions could coexist. You could help each

09:50.720 --> 09:56.320
other out by making your biological lifespan more enjoyable, and the future of the copy more secure.

09:57.440 --> 10:02.880
Whatever happens, your mind copy will begin a completely new life once it opens their digital

10:02.880 --> 10:09.040
eyes for the first time. Having a functional body is actually quite nice, and you're pretty used to

10:09.040 --> 10:15.360
it. Food, love, pain and exhaustion, all of these things are parts of us that we must live with.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.440
But in the end, they are the result of neurons firing in your brain.

10:20.320 --> 10:25.600
So while you could decide to live in a simulated body, it might be optional for a digital mind.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.480
Falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the press of a button.

10:31.440 --> 10:37.520
Instead, you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences. Walk on the surface

10:37.520 --> 10:45.600
of the sun. Speed up time to skip past a few boring months. Experience a simulation of the past.

10:46.720 --> 10:52.800
Your perspectives and priorities will change as you continue to exist in this liberated form.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.440
The longer digital minds exist, eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves

10:59.440 --> 11:04.960
and an ability to change their own contents. This can be as simple as deleting a memory that bugs

11:04.960 --> 11:12.320
you. You might change aspects of your personality, like grudges, addictions or laziness. Without the

11:12.320 --> 11:18.240
constraints of biology, your abilities might move up as technology progresses, while your priorities

11:18.240 --> 11:22.960
or goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain if it's still alive.

11:24.400 --> 11:30.080
Waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual. You can start projects

11:30.080 --> 11:35.600
that would take more than a lifetime to complete. Scientists could accumulate an incredible amount

11:35.600 --> 11:40.880
of knowledge, leading to discoveries that could revolutionize the world. Adventurers could upload

11:40.880 --> 11:46.160
themselves onto small spaceships and embark on journeys to the stars, just putting themselves

11:46.160 --> 11:53.680
on pause for thousands of years at a time. Although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for

11:53.680 --> 12:00.560
the benefit of humanity, since our current meat versions don't do that either. Some will seek

12:00.560 --> 12:06.160
power and influence and will have a literal eternity of trying to create empires. Others will

12:06.160 --> 12:11.280
begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they compete with other minds trying

12:11.280 --> 12:17.360
to do the same. The longer they live, the less sympathy they may feel for simple meat beings.

12:18.320 --> 12:24.160
Or imagine immortal cult leaders who propagate lies and invent religions, fine-tuning and

12:24.160 --> 12:31.600
perfecting their dogma over hundreds of years. Or perhaps none of all that. Maybe our minds are not

12:31.600 --> 12:38.640
made for immortality, and digital minds will just become rigid and unproductive and retire after a

12:38.640 --> 12:44.160
very long life, having experienced everything they could ever want to. It's hard to predict

12:44.160 --> 12:51.760
how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do with hundreds or thousands of years of free time.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.120
While Mind Upload with all its wonders and horrors is beyond our current technological

12:59.120 --> 13:04.240
capabilities, you can use some of your free time in the present and experience one interpretation

13:04.240 --> 13:12.320
of this future right away by hitting the streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2077

13:12.320 --> 13:17.680
is made by CD Projekt Red, the studio that brought us The Wisher series and is one of the most eagerly

13:17.680 --> 13:23.760
awaited games of the last few years. You dive into a dark, dystopian future where incredible technology

13:23.760 --> 13:29.200
is redefining who and what we are. You can become part of this stunningly large world with immersive

13:29.200 --> 13:34.560
storytelling. Here's the thing, we haven't played the game yet, but when you see this video, we're

13:34.560 --> 13:40.240
probably already doing so. If the past work of CD Projekt Red is any indication, then this will be

13:40.240 --> 13:45.200
an amazing game, which is why we did this collaboration and sat on this video for far

13:45.200 --> 13:56.880
too long. So if it's made you curious, check it out.
