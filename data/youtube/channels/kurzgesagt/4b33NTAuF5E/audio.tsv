720	6480	The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our first stories.
7040	14000	We exist in an endless universe, only bound by the laws of physics, and yet our consciousness
14000	20320	is trapped in mortal machines made of meat. With the breathtaking explosion of innovation
20320	26800	and progress, for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our
26800	34080	minds into a digital utopia seems possible, even like the logical next step on our revolutionary
34080	40880	ladder. Mind uploading and digital immortality are some of the core themes of the game Cyberpunk
40880	47520	2077. It plays in a grim dystopian future where humanity has progressed far beyond today's
47520	54240	technology and explores what this could mean for humanity. About a year ago, CD Projekt Red asked
54240	58800	us if we would like to make a video about some of these ideas and we were immediately on board.
59360	65520	So, let's explore this topic together. Is it possible to upload your mind into a computer?
66320	68400	Well, it's complicated.
77200	83360	Upload what exactly? Mind is one of those words that are really hard to define.
84000	88400	It's thought to be the collective abilities of your consciousness and intelligence, the thing
88400	95040	that lets you imagine, recognize, and dream. Mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making
95040	100480	a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your
100480	107440	consciousness. But even defining the premise gets really hard, really fast. The possibility of mind
107440	114400	uploading is based on three assumptions. Assumption 1. Your mind is in your brain's
114400	120240	structure, arrangement, and biochemistry. The idea that everything about the mind can be found
120240	125680	in the brain is called physicalism and it keeps our discussion within the domain of natural law.
126960	133280	Assumption 2. At some point, we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology
133280	136960	to simulate all of its aspects to make a digital mind copy.
138000	144960	Assumption 3. Computer software can host your mind, which means the mind is computable.
145920	149440	There is no physical property in the brain, including consciousness,
149440	153360	that cannot be simulated accurately even if it requires a lot of code.
154400	158800	All of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and philosophers
158800	164000	and they remain the subject of passionate debate. With so many fundamental questions
164000	167840	still unanswered, it's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone.
168800	173680	Whatever your position, every discussion of mind upload has to begin with the brain.
174800	181120	The brain in a nutshell. The brain is the most complex biological structure known
181120	185440	and deserves its own entire video, so let's just take a brief look at it.
186320	192240	Around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion connections that are sending
192240	198240	signals up to 1000 times each second, which is 1 quadrillion events every second of your
198240	204640	waking life. And it's not just neurons, there are billions of supporting and immune cells
204640	209760	of various types performing different jobs. On a macro level, the brain can be divided
209760	214160	in two sections with different roles, from breathing and heart rate, to coordinating
214800	220720	movement and involuntary reflexes. The most developed parts, the neocortex,
220720	226400	or the outermost layer of the brain, hold memories, our ability to plan, think and imagine,
226400	232880	hope and dream. Where exactly the you part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear.
233760	238480	We know that areas like the precuneus cortex have the greatest influence on our consciousness,
238480	243520	but also that several areas can network together to share tasks none of them can do alone.
244240	247360	The brain's building blocks are not exactly simple either.
248160	254960	Neurons are not just wires, they alter and process information. Synapses, where signals are handed
254960	259840	over from one neuron to the next, contain receptors for hundreds of chemical signals,
259840	265120	opening them up to outside influence. We have a basic understanding of how these work,
265120	270000	and we can accurately predict their behavior at small scales, but there's a lot more to the brain
270080	276400	than just nerve signals. Hormones play a huge role, like serotonin, which affects our mood,
276400	282080	or histamine, which helps us learn. The brain is influenced by our other parts too,
282080	287600	from heart nerves to gut bacteria. What seemed like a very complicated system to begin with
287600	293280	gets even more complicated the more we learn about it. To get this wildly interconnected mess
293280	298320	of cells and meat and chemicals into a computer, we need a model that we can simulate in our
298320	305680	digital world. Some sort of scan. Unfortunately, our scanning technology, like fMRI machines,
305680	310640	is not nearly good enough to attempt such a thing. But there is a different method that seems very
310640	316320	promising. Cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution electron
316320	323440	microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and connections. In 2019, scientists
323440	328720	successfully mapped a cubic millimeter of mouse brain, roughly the size of a big grain of sand.
329680	335760	It contained 100,000 neurons with a billion synapses and four kilometers of nerve fibers.
336960	344480	This grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices. Five electron microscopes ran continuously for
344480	349920	five months, collecting more than 100 million images. It took three months to assemble the
349920	356880	images into a 3D model. The completed data set fills up 2 million gigabytes of cloud storage.
357760	362400	To scan a whole human brain, we would have to repeat this effort a million times,
362400	367840	which is much easier said than done. Even worse, to correctly simulate a brain,
367840	371920	we might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the billions of
371920	378240	underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the behaviors we see at the cellular
378240	383920	level, which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on earth.
385840	392800	Brain water to consciousness wine. While all of these issues are annoying, the real question
392800	399040	is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an active thing. Even if we have a scan,
399040	404160	down to the level of synapses, we need laws and rules that animate the wiring diagram.
404160	409520	To endow this static structure with life, update it with the various laws of chemical binding
409520	416480	of electrodynamics to animate the simulation. So it becomes a dynamic active thing like a brain
416480	422320	that exists from one microsecond to the next that could evolve in time, think, see, and act.
423200	426960	The reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve.
427920	434960	If our technology can give rise to real minds. It all hinges on the nature of the problem.
436000	440240	Are the brain and mind just complicated and a lot of work to figure out,
440800	447440	or are they complex in a way that we can't solve? In the worst case, consciousness is more than the
447440	453360	sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we don't realize yet. Complex in a way that we can't
453360	459920	solve by getting better scans. Just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a
459920	466400	good consciousness cake. Right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results
466400	472880	and an end goal, but the road to true simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation and
472880	481040	research. Humans have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress. In the best
481040	486000	case, it's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right solutions. It might not be
486000	491600	necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom. Instead, it may be possible to
491600	497600	simplify elements into probabilistic models that could match the behavior of the brain using a more
497600	503760	manageable number of simpler systems. So we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain
503760	510640	and consciousness well enough to upload human minds, but the science is real and worth pursuing.
510640	515520	At the very least, we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new technologies.
516160	521200	If we succeed, this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly
521200	527760	progressing computer technology. The consequences for humanity and our future in this universe
527760	536880	are vast, creepy, and amazing. The copy. Successful mind uploading is functional
536880	543040	immortality. Unless damaged or deleted, you will continue to exist as long as a copy is stored
543040	549120	somewhere. Of course, if the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways, your mind might get
549120	555680	corrupted too. You might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic
555680	562800	breakdown. The question if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms. For now, we'll
562800	569440	just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you. How would mind uploading change
569440	576320	your outlook on life? Will you feel safer knowing that death is not necessarily the end? Or would
576320	582880	you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded? If scanning technology
582880	590720	does become advanced enough, your biological and digital versions could coexist. You could help each
590720	596320	other out by making your biological lifespan more enjoyable, and the future of the copy more secure.
597440	602880	Whatever happens, your mind copy will begin a completely new life once it opens their digital
602880	609040	eyes for the first time. Having a functional body is actually quite nice, and you're pretty used to
609040	615360	it. Food, love, pain and exhaustion, all of these things are parts of us that we must live with.
615920	619440	But in the end, they are the result of neurons firing in your brain.
620320	625600	So while you could decide to live in a simulated body, it might be optional for a digital mind.
626640	630480	Falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the press of a button.
631440	637520	Instead, you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences. Walk on the surface
637520	645600	of the sun. Speed up time to skip past a few boring months. Experience a simulation of the past.
646720	652800	Your perspectives and priorities will change as you continue to exist in this liberated form.
654000	659440	The longer digital minds exist, eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves
659440	664960	and an ability to change their own contents. This can be as simple as deleting a memory that bugs
664960	672320	you. You might change aspects of your personality, like grudges, addictions or laziness. Without the
672320	678240	constraints of biology, your abilities might move up as technology progresses, while your priorities
678240	682960	or goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain if it's still alive.
684400	690080	Waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual. You can start projects
690080	695600	that would take more than a lifetime to complete. Scientists could accumulate an incredible amount
695600	700880	of knowledge, leading to discoveries that could revolutionize the world. Adventurers could upload
700880	706160	themselves onto small spaceships and embark on journeys to the stars, just putting themselves
706160	713680	on pause for thousands of years at a time. Although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for
713680	720560	the benefit of humanity, since our current meat versions don't do that either. Some will seek
720560	726160	power and influence and will have a literal eternity of trying to create empires. Others will
726160	731280	begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they compete with other minds trying
731280	737360	to do the same. The longer they live, the less sympathy they may feel for simple meat beings.
738320	744160	Or imagine immortal cult leaders who propagate lies and invent religions, fine-tuning and
744160	751600	perfecting their dogma over hundreds of years. Or perhaps none of all that. Maybe our minds are not
751600	758640	made for immortality, and digital minds will just become rigid and unproductive and retire after a
758640	764160	very long life, having experienced everything they could ever want to. It's hard to predict
764160	771760	how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do with hundreds or thousands of years of free time.
774400	779120	While Mind Upload with all its wonders and horrors is beyond our current technological
779120	784240	capabilities, you can use some of your free time in the present and experience one interpretation
784240	792320	of this future right away by hitting the streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2077
792320	797680	is made by CD Projekt Red, the studio that brought us The Wisher series and is one of the most eagerly
797680	803760	awaited games of the last few years. You dive into a dark, dystopian future where incredible technology
803760	809200	is redefining who and what we are. You can become part of this stunningly large world with immersive
809200	814560	storytelling. Here's the thing, we haven't played the game yet, but when you see this video, we're
814560	820240	probably already doing so. If the past work of CD Projekt Red is any indication, then this will be
820240	825200	an amazing game, which is why we did this collaboration and sat on this video for far
825200	836880	too long. So if it's made you curious, check it out.
