1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,480
The desire to be free from the limits of the human experience is as old as our first stories.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,000
We exist in an endless universe, only bound by the laws of physics, and yet our consciousness

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,320
is trapped in mortal machines made of meat. With the breathtaking explosion of innovation

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,800
and progress, for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,080
minds into a digital utopia seems possible, even like the logical next step on our revolutionary

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,880
ladder. Mind uploading and digital immortality are some of the core themes of the game Cyberpunk

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,520
2077. It plays in a grim dystopian future where humanity has progressed far beyond today's

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,240
technology and explores what this could mean for humanity. About a year ago, CD Projekt Red asked

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,800
us if we would like to make a video about some of these ideas and we were immediately on board.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,520
So, let's explore this topic together. Is it possible to upload your mind into a computer?

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, it's complicated.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,360
Upload what exactly? Mind is one of those words that are really hard to define.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
It's thought to be the collective abilities of your consciousness and intelligence, the thing

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,040
that lets you imagine, recognize, and dream. Mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,480
a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,440
consciousness. But even defining the premise gets really hard, really fast. The possibility of mind

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,400
uploading is based on three assumptions. Assumption 1. Your mind is in your brain's

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,240
structure, arrangement, and biochemistry. The idea that everything about the mind can be found

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,680
in the brain is called physicalism and it keeps our discussion within the domain of natural law.

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,280
Assumption 2. At some point, we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,960
to simulate all of its aspects to make a digital mind copy.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,960
Assumption 3. Computer software can host your mind, which means the mind is computable.

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
There is no physical property in the brain, including consciousness,

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,360
that cannot be simulated accurately even if it requires a lot of code.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
All of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and philosophers

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,000
and they remain the subject of passionate debate. With so many fundamental questions

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
still unanswered, it's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone.

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
Whatever your position, every discussion of mind upload has to begin with the brain.

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,120
The brain in a nutshell. The brain is the most complex biological structure known

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
and deserves its own entire video, so let's just take a brief look at it.

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,240
Around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion connections that are sending

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,240
signals up to 1000 times each second, which is 1 quadrillion events every second of your

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,640
waking life. And it's not just neurons, there are billions of supporting and immune cells

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,760
of various types performing different jobs. On a macro level, the brain can be divided

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,160
in two sections with different roles, from breathing and heart rate, to coordinating

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,720
movement and involuntary reflexes. The most developed parts, the neocortex,

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,400
or the outermost layer of the brain, hold memories, our ability to plan, think and imagine,

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,880
hope and dream. Where exactly the you part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear.

39
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,480
We know that areas like the precuneus cortex have the greatest influence on our consciousness,

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,520
but also that several areas can network together to share tasks none of them can do alone.

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,360
The brain's building blocks are not exactly simple either.

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,960
Neurons are not just wires, they alter and process information. Synapses, where signals are handed

43
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,840
over from one neuron to the next, contain receptors for hundreds of chemical signals,

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
opening them up to outside influence. We have a basic understanding of how these work,

45
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,000
and we can accurately predict their behavior at small scales, but there's a lot more to the brain

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,400
than just nerve signals. Hormones play a huge role, like serotonin, which affects our mood,

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,080
or histamine, which helps us learn. The brain is influenced by our other parts too,

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,600
from heart nerves to gut bacteria. What seemed like a very complicated system to begin with

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,280
gets even more complicated the more we learn about it. To get this wildly interconnected mess

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
of cells and meat and chemicals into a computer, we need a model that we can simulate in our

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,680
digital world. Some sort of scan. Unfortunately, our scanning technology, like fMRI machines,

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,640
is not nearly good enough to attempt such a thing. But there is a different method that seems very

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,320
promising. Cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution electron

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,440
microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and connections. In 2019, scientists

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
successfully mapped a cubic millimeter of mouse brain, roughly the size of a big grain of sand.

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,760
It contained 100,000 neurons with a billion synapses and four kilometers of nerve fibers.

57
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,480
This grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices. Five electron microscopes ran continuously for

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,920
five months, collecting more than 100 million images. It took three months to assemble the

59
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,880
images into a 3D model. The completed data set fills up 2 million gigabytes of cloud storage.

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,400
To scan a whole human brain, we would have to repeat this effort a million times,

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,840
which is much easier said than done. Even worse, to correctly simulate a brain,

62
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,920
we might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the billions of

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,240
underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the behaviors we see at the cellular

64
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,920
level, which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on earth.

65
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Brain water to consciousness wine. While all of these issues are annoying, the real question

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,040
is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an active thing. Even if we have a scan,

67
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,160
down to the level of synapses, we need laws and rules that animate the wiring diagram.

68
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,520
To endow this static structure with life, update it with the various laws of chemical binding

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,480
of electrodynamics to animate the simulation. So it becomes a dynamic active thing like a brain

70
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,320
that exists from one microsecond to the next that could evolve in time, think, see, and act.

71
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,960
The reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve.

72
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,960
If our technology can give rise to real minds. It all hinges on the nature of the problem.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
Are the brain and mind just complicated and a lot of work to figure out,

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,440
or are they complex in a way that we can't solve? In the worst case, consciousness is more than the

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,360
sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we don't realize yet. Complex in a way that we can't

76
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,920
solve by getting better scans. Just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a

77
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,400
good consciousness cake. Right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results

78
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,880
and an end goal, but the road to true simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation and

79
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:01,040
research. Humans have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress. In the best

80
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,000
case, it's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right solutions. It might not be

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,600
necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom. Instead, it may be possible to

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,600
simplify elements into probabilistic models that could match the behavior of the brain using a more

83
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,760
manageable number of simpler systems. So we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain

84
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,640
and consciousness well enough to upload human minds, but the science is real and worth pursuing.

85
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,520
At the very least, we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new technologies.

86
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,200
If we succeed, this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly

87
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,760
progressing computer technology. The consequences for humanity and our future in this universe

88
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,880
are vast, creepy, and amazing. The copy. Successful mind uploading is functional

89
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,040
immortality. Unless damaged or deleted, you will continue to exist as long as a copy is stored

90
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,120
somewhere. Of course, if the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways, your mind might get

91
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,680
corrupted too. You might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic

92
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,800
breakdown. The question if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms. For now, we'll

93
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,440
just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you. How would mind uploading change

94
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,320
your outlook on life? Will you feel safer knowing that death is not necessarily the end? Or would

95
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,880
you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded? If scanning technology

96
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,720
does become advanced enough, your biological and digital versions could coexist. You could help each

97
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
other out by making your biological lifespan more enjoyable, and the future of the copy more secure.

98
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
Whatever happens, your mind copy will begin a completely new life once it opens their digital

99
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,040
eyes for the first time. Having a functional body is actually quite nice, and you're pretty used to

100
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,360
it. Food, love, pain and exhaustion, all of these things are parts of us that we must live with.

101
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
But in the end, they are the result of neurons firing in your brain.

102
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,600
So while you could decide to live in a simulated body, it might be optional for a digital mind.

103
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
Falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the press of a button.

104
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,520
Instead, you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences. Walk on the surface

105
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:45,600
of the sun. Speed up time to skip past a few boring months. Experience a simulation of the past.

106
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,800
Your perspectives and priorities will change as you continue to exist in this liberated form.

107
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,440
The longer digital minds exist, eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves

108
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,960
and an ability to change their own contents. This can be as simple as deleting a memory that bugs

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,320
you. You might change aspects of your personality, like grudges, addictions or laziness. Without the

110
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,240
constraints of biology, your abilities might move up as technology progresses, while your priorities

111
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,960
or goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain if it's still alive.

112
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,080
Waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual. You can start projects

113
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,600
that would take more than a lifetime to complete. Scientists could accumulate an incredible amount

114
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,880
of knowledge, leading to discoveries that could revolutionize the world. Adventurers could upload

115
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,160
themselves onto small spaceships and embark on journeys to the stars, just putting themselves

116
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,680
on pause for thousands of years at a time. Although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for

117
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,560
the benefit of humanity, since our current meat versions don't do that either. Some will seek

118
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,160
power and influence and will have a literal eternity of trying to create empires. Others will

119
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,280
begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they compete with other minds trying

120
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,360
to do the same. The longer they live, the less sympathy they may feel for simple meat beings.

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,160
Or imagine immortal cult leaders who propagate lies and invent religions, fine-tuning and

122
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,600
perfecting their dogma over hundreds of years. Or perhaps none of all that. Maybe our minds are not

123
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,640
made for immortality, and digital minds will just become rigid and unproductive and retire after a

124
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,160
very long life, having experienced everything they could ever want to. It's hard to predict

125
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,760
how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do with hundreds or thousands of years of free time.

126
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,120
While Mind Upload with all its wonders and horrors is beyond our current technological

127
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,240
capabilities, you can use some of your free time in the present and experience one interpretation

128
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,320
of this future right away by hitting the streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2077

129
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,680
is made by CD Projekt Red, the studio that brought us The Wisher series and is one of the most eagerly

130
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,760
awaited games of the last few years. You dive into a dark, dystopian future where incredible technology

131
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,200
is redefining who and what we are. You can become part of this stunningly large world with immersive

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,560
storytelling. Here's the thing, we haven't played the game yet, but when you see this video, we're

133
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,240
probably already doing so. If the past work of CD Projekt Red is any indication, then this will be

134
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,200
an amazing game, which is why we did this collaboration and sat on this video for far

135
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:56,880
too long. So if it's made you curious, check it out.
