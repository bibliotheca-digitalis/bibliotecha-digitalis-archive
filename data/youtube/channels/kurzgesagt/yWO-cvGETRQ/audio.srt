1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,920
Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,200
strong enough to rip whole stars into atom-sized pieces.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,960
While this is scary enough, they have an even more powerful and dark property.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,280
They might delete the universe itself.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:27,600
1. Black holes in a nutshell

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,480
A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,160
At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong,

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,920
and whatever gets too close is ripped into its elementary particles.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Not even light can escape black holes, and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,480
If you were to fall into a black hole,

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960
nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border, the event horizon.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,160
You can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,200
As you float along, imperceptibly, the stream gets faster and faster,

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,960
even if you can't see the waterfall yet.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,800
You could swim to safety until, without even noticing it, you cross the point of no return.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,920
No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards sudden death.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,120
This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,240
We can't access them unless we're willing to never return.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes,

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges.

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,920
Black holes radiate their mass away, like a hot pot on a stove losing its water esteem.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
This is called Hawking radiation.

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass,

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,880
a process that's unbelievably slow.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,760
It will take a black hole with the mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,920
years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,400
This is happening constantly and unstoppably, and as it goes on, it speeds up more and more.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,320
In the far, far future, when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years,

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,120
black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear,

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
leaving behind just a bit of radiation.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
But this is a problem, because in the process of disappearing,

33
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,960
black holes might delete something fundamental, information.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Information is nothing tangible.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of particles.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
Arrange them in a certain way and you get coal.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,080
Arrange them in a different way and you get a diamond.

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
The atoms are the same.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,960
What changes is the information.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
If we make this more complex and add in a few more atoms, we get a banana.

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Change the arrangement of the atoms and we get a squirrel.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
and don't care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee.

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,160
Without information, everything in the universe would be the same.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
According to the theory of quantum mechanics, information is indestructible.

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,120
It might change shape, but it can never be lost.

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,240
For example, if you burn a piece of paper, you get ash.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,720
That ash will never become paper again.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
But if you were able to carefully collect every single carbon atom in the ash

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
and measured the exact properties of the smoke and heat radiating from the fire,

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
you could, in theory, reconstruct the paper.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
The information of the paper is still in the universe.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
It's not lost, it's just hard to read.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,880
and wave of radiation in the universe,

57
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,080
you could see and track every bit of information there is.

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,920
Hypothetically, you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the Big Bang.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,360
And here, black holes trip us up.

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to be what.

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Black holes do the opposite.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
They take different things and make them the same.

63
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
They destroy information.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,760
This creates the information paradox, and this is a serious problem.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
The Information Paradox

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,920
It's fundamental for all our laws of physics that information can never be lost.

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,640
Existing, not existing.

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,280
Without information, everything is relative.

69
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,840
When it comes to our understanding of reality, we need absolutes.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
How could we solve this paradox?

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
There are a few possibilities.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
One, information is lost.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
Irretrievably and forever.

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,640
This means we have to nix all our laws of physics,

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
throwing out a lot of stuff that's worked very well so far and to start from scratch.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,440
What those new laws of physics would look like, or what that means for us, nobody knows.

77
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
This is a little frightening, but also kind of exciting.

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Two, information is hidden.

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby universe.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
The information would be transferred into this new,

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
weird place where we could never observe or interact with it,

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,920
but technically it would not be lost.

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,080
It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos that you could never access.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Sure, it's nice that they've not been deleted, but also not very helpful.

85
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life cycles,

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
but a little piece is left, an information diamond.

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
Like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information clowns.

88
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
But there's a third option, information is safe after all, not lost or hidden.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,600
Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,920
We know that black holes trap information and might delete it later,

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
but we never thought about what they do with it in the meantime.

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,040
Where do black holes store their information?

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
Cosmic housekeeping.

94
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry.

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
First, we fill up a room with laundry baskets.

96
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
The more laundry you want to store, the more baskets you put in the room.

97
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,600
But at some point, every single basket is full and the room is completely stacked.

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
Not a single extra sock fits in.

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,560
The room is at maximum capacity.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,880
But if we still squeeze the sock in with a lot of energy and violence,

101
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,600
But the capacity of the room itself has not changed.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,480
Fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible.

104
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,680
So what happens if we throw more laundry into it?

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,640
The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information.

106
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,040
It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel

107
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,120
for each bit of information we throw into it.

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
In a nutshell, more information means more surface area.

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,640
The information gets painted on the surface,

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,680
similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond.

111
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,800
After the stone sinks to the bottom, we can't see it anymore,

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,560
but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the pond.

113
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface

114
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,760
than all the data ever produced in human history.

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,280
They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably tiny.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,640
Black holes are the ultimate hard drive.

117
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,440
This is a bit like taking a paperback and turning it into an e-book.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,760
Two things that look completely different, but their content is the same.

119
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,480
It's just encoded and memorized in another way.

120
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Black holes swallowing stars and planets

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,880
is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an e-reader.

122
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,560
This solution is called the holographic principle.

123
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,880
But if it's correct, then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong.

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,440
The universe is a hologram.

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole,

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
the Hawking radiation has a chance of learning

127
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
about the information encoded there and can carry it away.

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,120
So, information is not lost when black holes fade away,

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
and we do not need to redo physics.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
The information paradox is resolved.

131
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,400
But we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way.

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,800
If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon,

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
that basically means that three-dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface.

134
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,040
We have a name for this, a hologram.

135
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,080
A hologram is like a 3D photo,

136
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three-dimensional image.

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
A black hole is like a hologram because everything inside it is encoded on its event horizon.

138
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
A person inside a black hole will experience their usual three-dimensional life.

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,640
But for us on the outside, they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole.

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,120
The consequence of this is counterintuitive, but stay with us for a moment.

141
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,080
Black holes are very extreme objects,

142
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else.

143
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,280
So if this crazy duality between 2D and 3D works for black holes,

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,400
then it might work for the whole universe and you in it.

145
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,840
Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a flat surface,

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
we might share the same fate.

147
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,360
You really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe.

148
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,720
The science behind this is complicated and really weird,

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
with toy universes to play with, string theory, and a lot of maths.

150
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
We'll talk about this more in another video.

151
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Regardless of what the true nature of the universe really is,

152
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,520
we just know that it's strange and complicated,

153
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
and we have to do a lot more physics to understand it.

154
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
But black holes might be key to understanding the nature of reality itself.

155
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,840
This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,440
and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini.
