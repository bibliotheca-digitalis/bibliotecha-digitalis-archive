720	3920	Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe,
3920	7200	strong enough to rip whole stars into atom-sized pieces.
7840	12960	While this is scary enough, they have an even more powerful and dark property.
12960	15280	They might delete the universe itself.
15280	27600	1. Black holes in a nutshell
29120	34480	A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space.
34480	38160	At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong,
38160	41920	and whatever gets too close is ripped into its elementary particles.
42640	47760	Not even light can escape black holes, and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness.
48880	50480	If you were to fall into a black hole,
50480	54960	nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border, the event horizon.
56000	60160	You can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall.
60960	65200	As you float along, imperceptibly, the stream gets faster and faster,
65200	66960	even if you can't see the waterfall yet.
67760	72800	You could swim to safety until, without even noticing it, you cross the point of no return.
73440	77920	No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards sudden death.
78800	81920	Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close.
82880	87120	This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe.
87120	90240	We can't access them unless we're willing to never return.
90960	94400	So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes,
94400	97680	but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges.
98640	103920	Black holes radiate their mass away, like a hot pot on a stove losing its water esteem.
104640	106880	This is called Hawking radiation.
106880	110240	Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass,
110800	112880	a process that's unbelievably slow.
113680	119760	It will take a black hole with the mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion
119760	125920	years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass.
126720	132400	This is happening constantly and unstoppably, and as it goes on, it speeds up more and more.
133200	138320	In the far, far future, when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years,
138320	143120	black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear,
143120	145280	leaving behind just a bit of radiation.
145920	149280	But this is a problem, because in the process of disappearing,
149280	152960	black holes might delete something fundamental, information.
157280	159280	Information is nothing tangible.
159280	162480	It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of particles.
164720	166800	Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms.
166800	169040	Arrange them in a certain way and you get coal.
169600	172080	Arrange them in a different way and you get a diamond.
173680	175120	The atoms are the same.
175120	176960	What changes is the information.
177920	182000	If we make this more complex and add in a few more atoms, we get a banana.
182560	185360	Change the arrangement of the atoms and we get a squirrel.
186400	190080	The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same
190080	194000	and don't care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee.
194720	198160	Without information, everything in the universe would be the same.
199280	203440	According to the theory of quantum mechanics, information is indestructible.
204160	207120	It might change shape, but it can never be lost.
207120	210240	For example, if you burn a piece of paper, you get ash.
210800	212720	That ash will never become paper again.
213280	217840	But if you were able to carefully collect every single carbon atom in the ash
217840	221760	and measured the exact properties of the smoke and heat radiating from the fire,
221760	224080	you could, in theory, reconstruct the paper.
224720	228000	The information of the paper is still in the universe.
228000	230400	It's not lost, it's just hard to read.
231360	234720	If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle
234720	236880	and wave of radiation in the universe,
236880	240080	you could see and track every bit of information there is.
240640	245920	Hypothetically, you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the Big Bang.
246800	249360	And here, black holes trip us up.
250400	254800	Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to be what.
255600	257600	Black holes do the opposite.
257600	260080	They take different things and make them the same.
260800	262160	They destroy information.
263120	267760	This creates the information paradox, and this is a serious problem.
270400	271920	The Information Paradox
273520	277920	It's fundamental for all our laws of physics that information can never be lost.
278560	280640	Existing, not existing.
280640	283280	Without information, everything is relative.
283920	287840	When it comes to our understanding of reality, we need absolutes.
288640	290240	How could we solve this paradox?
291120	292720	There are a few possibilities.
293600	295840	One, information is lost.
295840	298160	Irretrievably and forever.
298160	300640	This means we have to nix all our laws of physics,
300640	304240	throwing out a lot of stuff that's worked very well so far and to start from scratch.
304880	309440	What those new laws of physics would look like, or what that means for us, nobody knows.
310160	312720	This is a little frightening, but also kind of exciting.
313920	315600	Two, information is hidden.
316240	320000	Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby universe.
320000	322560	The information would be transferred into this new,
322560	325600	weird place where we could never observe or interact with it,
325600	327920	but technically it would not be lost.
327920	332080	It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos that you could never access.
332800	336640	Sure, it's nice that they've not been deleted, but also not very helpful.
337440	341440	Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life cycles,
341520	344320	but a little piece is left, an information diamond.
344960	348560	Like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information clowns.
349520	354320	But there's a third option, information is safe after all, not lost or hidden.
355040	357600	Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way.
358240	361920	We know that black holes trap information and might delete it later,
361920	364320	but we never thought about what they do with it in the meantime.
364960	367040	Where do black holes store their information?
369600	370720	Cosmic housekeeping.
371440	375840	Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry.
375840	378240	First, we fill up a room with laundry baskets.
378240	381600	The more laundry you want to store, the more baskets you put in the room.
382320	387600	But at some point, every single basket is full and the room is completely stacked.
387600	390240	Not a single extra sock fits in.
390240	392560	The room is at maximum capacity.
393440	396880	But if we still squeeze the sock in with a lot of energy and violence,
396880	400000	the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole.
400720	403600	But the capacity of the room itself has not changed.
403600	406480	Fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible.
407200	409680	So what happens if we throw more laundry into it?
410720	414640	The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information.
415440	419040	It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel
419040	421120	for each bit of information we throw into it.
422240	425680	In a nutshell, more information means more surface area.
426400	428640	The information gets painted on the surface,
428640	431680	similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond.
431680	434800	After the stone sinks to the bottom, we can't see it anymore,
434800	438560	but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the pond.
439600	443120	Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface
443120	445760	than all the data ever produced in human history.
446400	451280	They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably tiny.
452160	454640	Black holes are the ultimate hard drive.
455760	459440	This is a bit like taking a paperback and turning it into an e-book.
460000	463760	Two things that look completely different, but their content is the same.
463760	466480	It's just encoded and memorized in another way.
467440	469760	Black holes swallowing stars and planets
469760	472880	is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an e-reader.
473760	476560	This solution is called the holographic principle.
476560	480880	But if it's correct, then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong.
480880	485440	The universe is a hologram.
488080	491440	If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole,
491440	493680	the Hawking radiation has a chance of learning
493680	496720	about the information encoded there and can carry it away.
497920	501120	So, information is not lost when black holes fade away,
501120	503520	and we do not need to redo physics.
503520	505840	The information paradox is resolved.
506480	510400	But we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way.
511040	514800	If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon,
514800	519200	that basically means that three-dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface.
519200	521040	We have a name for this, a hologram.
521840	524080	A hologram is like a 3D photo,
524080	527440	a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three-dimensional image.
528080	533040	A black hole is like a hologram because everything inside it is encoded on its event horizon.
533920	537920	A person inside a black hole will experience their usual three-dimensional life.
538480	542640	But for us on the outside, they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole.
543360	547120	The consequence of this is counterintuitive, but stay with us for a moment.
547840	550080	Black holes are very extreme objects,
550080	552560	but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else.
553360	557280	So if this crazy duality between 2D and 3D works for black holes,
557280	560400	then it might work for the whole universe and you in it.
561280	565840	Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a flat surface,
565840	567200	we might share the same fate.
567920	571360	You really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe.
572880	576720	The science behind this is complicated and really weird,
576720	580480	with toy universes to play with, string theory, and a lot of maths.
581120	583040	We'll talk about this more in another video.
583920	586880	Regardless of what the true nature of the universe really is,
586880	589520	we just know that it's strange and complicated,
589520	592000	and we have to do a lot more physics to understand it.
592560	597360	But black holes might be key to understanding the nature of reality itself.
598880	601840	This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation
601840	605440	and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini.
