00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Let's start this video by throwing a mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
Let's say, a stack of mattresses.

00:08.500 --> 00:16.000
The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment before it shakes itself off and walks away pretty annoyed because that's a very rude thing to do.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way, and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
The answer is size.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
Size determines everything about our biology, how we are built, how we experience the world, how we live and die.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
It does so because the physical laws are different for different sized animals.

00:48.000 --> 00:59.000
Life spans seven orders of magnitude, from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants, and blue whales.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other, each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
We'll explore these different worlds in a series of videos.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Let's get back to the initial question.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Why did our mouse survive the fall?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Because of how scaling size changes everything, a principle that will meet over and over again.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
Very small things, for example, are practically immune to falling from great heights because the smaller you are, the less you care about the effect of gravity.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble.

01:36.000 --> 01:46.000
It has three features, its length, its surface area which is covered in skin, and its volume, or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes and dreams.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
If we make it ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features don't just grow ten times.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
Its skin will grow one hundred times, and its insides, or its volume, grows by one thousand times.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
The volume determines the weight, or more accurately, mass of the animal.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground, and the stronger the impact shock.

02:11.000 --> 02:21.000
The more surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have, the more the impact gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you down.

02:21.000 --> 02:32.000
An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio to its volume, so a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space, and the air doesn't slow it down much at all.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
That's why it's completely destroyed in an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
The other extreme, insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass, so you can literally throw an ant from an airplane, and it will not be seriously harmed.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
But while falling is irrelevant in the small world, there are other forces that are harmless for us, but extremely dangerous for small beings.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Like surface tension, which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects. How does it work?

03:02.000 --> 03:14.000
Water has the tendency to stick to itself. Its molecules are attracted to each other through a force called cohesion, which creates a tension on its surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
For us, this skin is so weak that we don't even notice it normally.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
If you get wet, about 800 grams of water, or about 1% of your body weight, sticks to you.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
A wet mouse has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body weight.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Imagine having eight full water bottles sticking to you when you leave the shower.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
But for an insect, the force of water's surface tension is so strong that getting wet is a question of life and death.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant, and you touch water, it would be like you were reaching into glue.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
It would quickly engulf you, its surface tension too hard for you to break, and you'd drown.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So insects evolved to be water repellent.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
For one, their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax, just like a car.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
This makes their surface at least partly water repellent, because it can't stick to it very well.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the droplets from touching their exoskeleton, and make it easier to get rid of droplets.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
To make use of surface tension, evolution cracked nanotechnology billions of years before us.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a short and extremely dense coat of water-repelling hair.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Some have more than a million hairs per square millimeter.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
When the insect dives underwater, air stays inside their fur and forms a coat of air.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Water can't enter because the hairs are too tiny to break its surface tension.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
But it gets even better.

04:46.000 --> 04:55.000
As the oxygen of the air bubble runs out, new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water around it, while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
And so the insect carries its own outside lung around, and can basically breathe underwater thanks to surface tension.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
This is the same principle that enables pond skaters to walk on water, by the way.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Tiny anti-water hairs.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
The smaller you get, the weirder the environment becomes.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
At some point, even air becomes more and more solid.

05:16.000 --> 05:24.000
Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known, about half the size of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
The fairy fly.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
They live in a world even weirder than other insects.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
For them, air itself is like thin jello, a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Movement through it is not easy.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Flying on this level is not like elegant gliding.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
They have to kind of grab and hold onto air.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
So their wings look like big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
They literally swim through the air like a tiny gross alien through syrup.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
Things only become stranger from here on as we explore more universes of different sizes.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.000
The physical rules are so different for each size that evolution had to engineer around them over and over as life grew in size in the last billion years.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So why are there no ants the size of horses?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Why no elephants the size of amoeba?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Why?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
We'll discuss this in the next part.
