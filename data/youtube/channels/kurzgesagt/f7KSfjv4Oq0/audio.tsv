0	6500	Let's start this video by throwing a mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft.
6500	8500	Let's say, a stack of mattresses.
8500	16000	The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment before it shakes itself off and walks away pretty annoyed because that's a very rude thing to do.
16000	26000	The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way, and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed.
26000	30000	Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't?
30000	32000	The answer is size.
32000	36000	Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.
36000	43000	Size determines everything about our biology, how we are built, how we experience the world, how we live and die.
43000	48000	It does so because the physical laws are different for different sized animals.
48000	59000	Life spans seven orders of magnitude, from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants, and blue whales.
59000	67000	Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other, each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides.
67000	70000	We'll explore these different worlds in a series of videos.
70000	73000	Let's get back to the initial question.
73000	76000	Why did our mouse survive the fall?
77000	83000	Because of how scaling size changes everything, a principle that will meet over and over again.
83000	92000	Very small things, for example, are practically immune to falling from great heights because the smaller you are, the less you care about the effect of gravity.
92000	96000	Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble.
96000	106000	It has three features, its length, its surface area which is covered in skin, and its volume, or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes and dreams.
106000	113000	If we make it ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features don't just grow ten times.
113000	120000	Its skin will grow one hundred times, and its insides, or its volume, grows by one thousand times.
120000	125000	The volume determines the weight, or more accurately, mass of the animal.
125000	131000	The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground, and the stronger the impact shock.
131000	141000	The more surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have, the more the impact gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you down.
141000	152000	An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio to its volume, so a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space, and the air doesn't slow it down much at all.
152000	158000	That's why it's completely destroyed in an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground.
158000	168000	The other extreme, insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass, so you can literally throw an ant from an airplane, and it will not be seriously harmed.
168000	175000	But while falling is irrelevant in the small world, there are other forces that are harmless for us, but extremely dangerous for small beings.
175000	182000	Like surface tension, which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects. How does it work?
182000	194000	Water has the tendency to stick to itself. Its molecules are attracted to each other through a force called cohesion, which creates a tension on its surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin.
194000	198000	For us, this skin is so weak that we don't even notice it normally.
198000	204000	If you get wet, about 800 grams of water, or about 1% of your body weight, sticks to you.
204000	210000	A wet mouse has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body weight.
210000	214000	Imagine having eight full water bottles sticking to you when you leave the shower.
214000	221000	But for an insect, the force of water's surface tension is so strong that getting wet is a question of life and death.
221000	227000	If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant, and you touch water, it would be like you were reaching into glue.
227000	233000	It would quickly engulf you, its surface tension too hard for you to break, and you'd drown.
233000	236000	So insects evolved to be water repellent.
236000	241000	For one, their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax, just like a car.
241000	247000	This makes their surface at least partly water repellent, because it can't stick to it very well.
247000	251000	Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.
251000	259000	They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the droplets from touching their exoskeleton, and make it easier to get rid of droplets.
259000	265000	To make use of surface tension, evolution cracked nanotechnology billions of years before us.
265000	271000	Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a short and extremely dense coat of water-repelling hair.
271000	275000	Some have more than a million hairs per square millimeter.
275000	280000	When the insect dives underwater, air stays inside their fur and forms a coat of air.
280000	284000	Water can't enter because the hairs are too tiny to break its surface tension.
284000	286000	But it gets even better.
286000	295000	As the oxygen of the air bubble runs out, new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water around it, while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water.
295000	302000	And so the insect carries its own outside lung around, and can basically breathe underwater thanks to surface tension.
302000	306000	This is the same principle that enables pond skaters to walk on water, by the way.
306000	309000	Tiny anti-water hairs.
309000	312000	The smaller you get, the weirder the environment becomes.
312000	316000	At some point, even air becomes more and more solid.
316000	324000	Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known, about half the size of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long.
324000	325000	The fairy fly.
325000	328000	They live in a world even weirder than other insects.
328000	334000	For them, air itself is like thin jello, a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.
334000	336000	Movement through it is not easy.
336000	339000	Flying on this level is not like elegant gliding.
339000	342000	They have to kind of grab and hold onto air.
342000	347000	So their wings look like big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings.
347000	352000	They literally swim through the air like a tiny gross alien through syrup.
352000	358000	Things only become stranger from here on as we explore more universes of different sizes.
358000	367000	The physical rules are so different for each size that evolution had to engineer around them over and over as life grew in size in the last billion years.
367000	371000	So why are there no ants the size of horses?
371000	374000	Why no elephants the size of amoeba?
374000	375000	Why?
375000	378000	We'll discuss this in the next part.
