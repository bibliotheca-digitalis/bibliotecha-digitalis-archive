00:00.640 --> 00:03.920
One of the greatest illusions in life is continuity.

00:05.200 --> 00:10.880
66 million years ago, the continuity of the dinosaurs had been going on for around

00:10.880 --> 00:17.040
165 million years already, and it didn't seem this would change anytime soon.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.760
The world was warm and pleasant, and most of the land was covered with lush forests

00:21.760 --> 00:27.760
and an incredible diversity of trees, flowers, ferns, and trillions of critters.

00:28.480 --> 00:34.320
Dinosaurs were ubiquitous and had diversified into hundreds of species of all shapes and sizes.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.600
Titanosaurs, large gentle giants, shared the world with famous beasts like Tyrannosaurus rex

00:41.600 --> 00:46.800
or Edmontosaurus. Pectinodon hunted in the undergrowth,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.320
while Edmontosaurus wandered coastlines and swamps.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.160
An ancient paradise, a world of plenty, full of life.

00:56.160 --> 01:03.280
66 million years ago, maybe on a Tuesday afternoon, life was the same as it had been

01:03.280 --> 01:08.480
the day before, or a thousand years before, or pretty much a million years before.

01:08.480 --> 01:15.360
Things were good for our feathered dinosaur buddies, until a tiny, tiny detail in the sky changed.

01:15.360 --> 01:29.600
If there were dinosaurs watching the stars, one night they may have noticed the appearance

01:29.600 --> 01:35.280
of a new star, a tiny dot that for many weeks slowly became bigger and brighter.

01:36.240 --> 01:41.200
Until one fateful day, it looked like another, small moon in the night sky.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.160
And then, it faded from sight as it dipped into Earth's shadow.

01:46.720 --> 01:53.360
For a few more hours, the illusion of continuity was upheld, until it was not anymore.

01:54.080 --> 02:00.160
In the morning, the object suddenly appears again, now almost as large as the sun in the sky and

02:00.160 --> 02:04.400
growing every moment, heading for the coast near the Yucatan Peninsula.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.800
It takes the asteroid only seconds to pass through the thin layer between

02:08.800 --> 02:14.080
space and the ground to make contact, as it enters the atmosphere at almost

02:14.080 --> 02:18.160
60 times the speed of sound. Let's stop time.

02:18.880 --> 02:26.320
Here, we see the unnamed asteroid about to commit specieside. Larger than Mount Everest,

02:26.320 --> 02:30.880
it reaches from the ocean high into the atmosphere, higher than passenger planes

02:30.880 --> 02:35.600
would fly millions of years later. At this moment, the world was one way.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.520
In a fraction of a second, it would be fundamentally different.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.160
Let's make the transition. As the asteroid hits the shallow

02:44.160 --> 02:49.200
ocean and the bedrock below, the energy of billions of nuclear weapons is released all

02:49.200 --> 02:55.520
at once as the asteroid vaporizes. A flash of light illuminates the sky

02:55.520 --> 02:59.280
as an eerie bright white sphere grows over the Gulf of Mexico.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.040
Bedrock melts into seething hot plasma at tens of thousands of degrees Celsius.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.200
The thermal radiation from the explosion travels at the speed of light and immediately burns

03:11.200 --> 03:16.640
everything within a radius of about 1,500 kilometers, while the energy from the impact

03:16.640 --> 03:22.960
pushes so hard against Earth's crust that it loses all strength and flows away from the impact site

03:22.960 --> 03:28.400
like a liquid, creating a hole 25 kilometers deep and 100 kilometers wide.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.000
The ocean is pushed back for hundreds of kilometers, like when a kid jumps into a puddle.

03:34.880 --> 03:40.080
As the crust bounces back, melted and flowing crust forms a temporary mountain,

03:40.080 --> 03:45.120
stretching 10 kilometers into the sky. An incredible amount of material is

03:45.120 --> 03:50.560
blasted into the higher atmosphere, or even out into space, as much as 60 times

03:50.560 --> 03:55.280
the original mass of the asteroid. The violence of the strike is felt

03:55.280 --> 04:00.480
everywhere on Earth within minutes. A magnitude 11 earthquake may be the

04:00.480 --> 04:04.960
most powerful quake any living thing has ever witnessed in billions of years.

04:05.520 --> 04:12.160
It is so insanely strong that in India it might have shaken gigantic lava fields and causes

04:12.160 --> 04:18.000
volcanic eruptions that would last for 30,000 years and cover half of the Indian subcontinent

04:18.000 --> 04:24.160
with lava. Even on the side of Earth opposite the impact, the ground still moved by several meters.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.960
Nobody would sleep through this day. The gigantic explosion crashes against the

04:30.960 --> 04:36.800
atmosphere with unprecedented violence and causes a shockwave that reaches speeds of more than 1,000

04:36.800 --> 04:41.760
kilometers per hour near the site of impact, similar to the hyper hurricanes on gas giants

04:41.760 --> 04:48.720
like Neptune. In middle America, basically any soil, vegetation, or animal is just shredded

04:48.720 --> 04:54.480
into pieces and catapulted thousands of kilometers away. Now the previously displaced

04:54.480 --> 05:00.000
oceans return. As the temporary mountain at the site of impact collapses, a ring of tsunamis as

05:00.000 --> 05:04.720
high as one kilometer, enough to cover all skyscrapers humans would ever build, heads in

05:04.720 --> 05:10.000
all directions. As they crash into the coasts of the continents surrounding the impact, they will

05:10.000 --> 05:16.080
drown thousands of kilometers of coastline. 15 hours later, some of the waves that get

05:16.080 --> 05:21.360
refracted around South America will still tower as much as 100 meters into the sky.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.600
But we still haven't talked about the worst thing yet. A lot of the debris yeeted into space will

05:27.600 --> 05:34.320
orbit Earth for thousands of years. Some may hit the moon or even Mars. But most of it comes right

05:34.320 --> 05:40.480
back. When things fall through the atmosphere at such speeds, they get very hot, as in hundreds of

05:40.480 --> 05:47.200
degrees hot. And this happens to millions of tons of material everywhere. This rapidly heats up the

05:47.200 --> 05:53.120
atmosphere to insane temperatures. We don't know exactly how hot it got or how long this heat shock

05:53.120 --> 05:58.640
lasted. But there are two ideas here. Either the air was heated to hundreds of degrees for a few

05:58.640 --> 06:04.720
minutes, or 2000s of degrees for around one minute. In any case, the air became as hot as the

06:04.720 --> 06:10.960
inside of an industrial oven. How bad the global effects of this were is contested. But if enough

06:10.960 --> 06:15.600
heat reached the surface, a lot of plants and animals would have died very quickly if they

06:15.600 --> 06:21.680
couldn't bury themselves or escape into caves. The heat together with raining debris also may have

06:21.680 --> 06:28.320
ignited material on forest floors and sparked wildfires as the Earth rotated under the searing

06:28.320 --> 06:34.640
hot plume. In a few hours, massive wildfires were probably burning around the globe. Some of them

06:34.640 --> 06:40.400
may have lasted for months and turned Earth into a horrifying, hot, hellish version of itself.

06:41.040 --> 06:47.200
As the day of the impact draws to an end, many of the dinosaurs are already dead, but the worst is

06:47.200 --> 06:54.000
still to come. The gigantic plume of vaporized material reaches the upper atmosphere and spreads

06:54.000 --> 07:00.320
around the whole globe. Together with the soot from the burning planet and the aerosols generated

07:00.320 --> 07:06.640
at impact, the planet sinks into a deep darkness, with only the remaining raging fires illuminating

07:06.640 --> 07:13.440
the scenery. Whatever plants survive the firestorms will now be starved for sunlight, as global

07:13.440 --> 07:20.800
photosynthesis is temporarily shut down. Within days, temperatures crash as much as 25 degrees Celsius.

07:21.680 --> 07:27.840
The oceans were especially hard hit. The lack of sunlight killed over 90 percent of plankton,

07:27.840 --> 07:33.440
which formed the basis of the food web of marine life. Ultimately, this would kill off the large

07:33.440 --> 07:39.440
marine reptiles and ammonites that used to dominate the seas. The biosphere that survivors

07:39.440 --> 07:46.240
now find themselves in is like an alien landscape. Ash, debris, and the burned remains of the formerly

07:46.240 --> 07:53.600
lush and blooming life cover the ground. The sky is dark and it's cold and fresh food is scarce,

07:53.600 --> 08:00.240
while fungi thrive. For months and years, the planet will be a hostile and deadly place.

08:00.800 --> 08:08.000
The sudden global winter will last for decades. At least 75 percent of all species on earth

08:08.000 --> 08:15.360
will just vanish from existence. And so, as the day ends, the world is suddenly different.

08:16.240 --> 08:24.000
The continuity that went on for millions of years is no more. The era of the dinosaurs is over.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.240
Just like that. Eventually, from the ashes of the old world, survivors emerged. Birds that are the

08:32.240 --> 08:37.840
direct descendants of the dinosaurs and mammals that would eventually become the dominant animals

08:37.840 --> 08:44.080
on the planet. Without the asteroid, who knows what life on earth would look like today? Without

08:44.080 --> 08:50.000
the sudden disruption of dinosaur continuity that completely changed the planet and all life on it,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.080
we might have never had the opportunity to become what we are today.

08:55.680 --> 09:02.720
It's not clear how long the human era will last. So far, modern humans have been around for 0.1

09:02.720 --> 09:08.160
percent of the time the dinosaurs were. And in this short amount of time, we've achieved

09:08.160 --> 09:14.880
impressive feats. From making the world our own, to reaching space and splitting the atom. Yet,

09:14.880 --> 09:22.080
our future and our long-term survival are not a given. If we're not careful, it could end in an

09:22.080 --> 09:28.800
instant, like the age of the dinosaurs ended. But in contrast to them, we know that our continuity

09:28.800 --> 09:36.080
is fragile, even if it doesn't feel like it. We can be prepared and be vigilant and hopeful.

09:36.080 --> 09:41.120
If we're lucky, our journey will go on for a long, long time.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.680
Speaking of journeys, we want to address something in the spirit of transparency.

09:48.320 --> 09:53.360
Quadska's art has changed in the last two years. We've become more than a YouTube channel or

09:53.360 --> 09:58.480
animation studio and now also run a paper shop that sells hundreds of thousands of calendars,

09:58.480 --> 10:04.080
posters and notebooks. That's not a happy accident, many of us have a background in graphic design.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.880
Paper products are our roots and we actually started out creating posters,

10:08.880 --> 10:13.680
books and print infographics. We love that you can touch them, smell them,

10:13.680 --> 10:19.120
nerd about small details and printing techniques. Just like the channel, we started small and

10:19.120 --> 10:24.720
without great ambition. Step by step, we found the right printers and papers, learned about shipping

10:24.720 --> 10:30.000
and expanded our shop. We put a huge amount of research, love and hours into it, because this

10:30.000 --> 10:34.240
is the only way we know how to do things. We don't just want to make generic merch,

10:34.240 --> 10:39.600
we want to make things that fit our mission of making science exciting and creating beautiful

10:39.600 --> 10:46.800
things. Things that persist and are made with high quality and love. Our shop gives us another outlet

10:46.800 --> 10:52.560
to do this and as a nice side effect has turned into our main source of income for everything we

10:52.560 --> 10:59.520
do on this channel, which also keeps us independent and our videos free for everyone. So we want to

10:59.600 --> 11:05.680
build further on that and create more things that last. We've just started a new notebook line

11:05.680 --> 11:10.640
called Pocket Log that we'll expand on in the future. The first edition is a dinosaur themed

11:10.640 --> 11:15.440
collection that will hopefully serve a future paleontologist well. There are loads of plans

11:15.440 --> 11:21.920
for sciency stuff, more journals and calendars and infographics. Let us know what you would like us to

11:21.920 --> 11:29.600
make for your room, kids, classrooms and yourself. In the end, the things we do work because you like

11:29.600 --> 11:35.040
them and because you enable us to put thousands of hours into videos and hundreds of hours into

11:35.040 --> 11:40.960
posters and journals. Thank you so much for that. We're looking forward to making fun sciency stuff

11:40.960 --> 11:59.040
for you, no matter if it's a video, a poster or something else entirely. Thank you for watching.
