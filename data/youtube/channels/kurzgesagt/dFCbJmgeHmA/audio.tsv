640	3920	One of the greatest illusions in life is continuity.
5200	10880	66 million years ago, the continuity of the dinosaurs had been going on for around
10880	17040	165 million years already, and it didn't seem this would change anytime soon.
17040	21760	The world was warm and pleasant, and most of the land was covered with lush forests
21760	27760	and an incredible diversity of trees, flowers, ferns, and trillions of critters.
28480	34320	Dinosaurs were ubiquitous and had diversified into hundreds of species of all shapes and sizes.
35280	41600	Titanosaurs, large gentle giants, shared the world with famous beasts like Tyrannosaurus rex
41600	46800	or Edmontosaurus. Pectinodon hunted in the undergrowth,
46800	50320	while Edmontosaurus wandered coastlines and swamps.
51280	56160	An ancient paradise, a world of plenty, full of life.
56160	63280	66 million years ago, maybe on a Tuesday afternoon, life was the same as it had been
63280	68480	the day before, or a thousand years before, or pretty much a million years before.
68480	75360	Things were good for our feathered dinosaur buddies, until a tiny, tiny detail in the sky changed.
75360	89600	If there were dinosaurs watching the stars, one night they may have noticed the appearance
89600	95280	of a new star, a tiny dot that for many weeks slowly became bigger and brighter.
96240	101200	Until one fateful day, it looked like another, small moon in the night sky.
102000	106160	And then, it faded from sight as it dipped into Earth's shadow.
106720	113360	For a few more hours, the illusion of continuity was upheld, until it was not anymore.
114080	120160	In the morning, the object suddenly appears again, now almost as large as the sun in the sky and
120160	124400	growing every moment, heading for the coast near the Yucatan Peninsula.
125040	128800	It takes the asteroid only seconds to pass through the thin layer between
128800	134080	space and the ground to make contact, as it enters the atmosphere at almost
134080	138160	60 times the speed of sound. Let's stop time.
138880	146320	Here, we see the unnamed asteroid about to commit specieside. Larger than Mount Everest,
146320	150880	it reaches from the ocean high into the atmosphere, higher than passenger planes
150880	155600	would fly millions of years later. At this moment, the world was one way.
156160	159520	In a fraction of a second, it would be fundamentally different.
160320	164160	Let's make the transition. As the asteroid hits the shallow
164160	169200	ocean and the bedrock below, the energy of billions of nuclear weapons is released all
169200	175520	at once as the asteroid vaporizes. A flash of light illuminates the sky
175520	179280	as an eerie bright white sphere grows over the Gulf of Mexico.
180000	185040	Bedrock melts into seething hot plasma at tens of thousands of degrees Celsius.
186000	191200	The thermal radiation from the explosion travels at the speed of light and immediately burns
191200	196640	everything within a radius of about 1,500 kilometers, while the energy from the impact
196640	202960	pushes so hard against Earth's crust that it loses all strength and flows away from the impact site
202960	208400	like a liquid, creating a hole 25 kilometers deep and 100 kilometers wide.
209280	214000	The ocean is pushed back for hundreds of kilometers, like when a kid jumps into a puddle.
214880	220080	As the crust bounces back, melted and flowing crust forms a temporary mountain,
220080	225120	stretching 10 kilometers into the sky. An incredible amount of material is
225120	230560	blasted into the higher atmosphere, or even out into space, as much as 60 times
230560	235280	the original mass of the asteroid. The violence of the strike is felt
235280	240480	everywhere on Earth within minutes. A magnitude 11 earthquake may be the
240480	244960	most powerful quake any living thing has ever witnessed in billions of years.
245520	252160	It is so insanely strong that in India it might have shaken gigantic lava fields and causes
252160	258000	volcanic eruptions that would last for 30,000 years and cover half of the Indian subcontinent
258000	264160	with lava. Even on the side of Earth opposite the impact, the ground still moved by several meters.
264960	270960	Nobody would sleep through this day. The gigantic explosion crashes against the
270960	276800	atmosphere with unprecedented violence and causes a shockwave that reaches speeds of more than 1,000
276800	281760	kilometers per hour near the site of impact, similar to the hyper hurricanes on gas giants
281760	288720	like Neptune. In middle America, basically any soil, vegetation, or animal is just shredded
288720	294480	into pieces and catapulted thousands of kilometers away. Now the previously displaced
294480	300000	oceans return. As the temporary mountain at the site of impact collapses, a ring of tsunamis as
300000	304720	high as one kilometer, enough to cover all skyscrapers humans would ever build, heads in
304720	310000	all directions. As they crash into the coasts of the continents surrounding the impact, they will
310000	316080	drown thousands of kilometers of coastline. 15 hours later, some of the waves that get
316080	321360	refracted around South America will still tower as much as 100 meters into the sky.
322000	327600	But we still haven't talked about the worst thing yet. A lot of the debris yeeted into space will
327600	334320	orbit Earth for thousands of years. Some may hit the moon or even Mars. But most of it comes right
334320	340480	back. When things fall through the atmosphere at such speeds, they get very hot, as in hundreds of
340480	347200	degrees hot. And this happens to millions of tons of material everywhere. This rapidly heats up the
347200	353120	atmosphere to insane temperatures. We don't know exactly how hot it got or how long this heat shock
353120	358640	lasted. But there are two ideas here. Either the air was heated to hundreds of degrees for a few
358640	364720	minutes, or 2000s of degrees for around one minute. In any case, the air became as hot as the
364720	370960	inside of an industrial oven. How bad the global effects of this were is contested. But if enough
370960	375600	heat reached the surface, a lot of plants and animals would have died very quickly if they
375600	381680	couldn't bury themselves or escape into caves. The heat together with raining debris also may have
381680	388320	ignited material on forest floors and sparked wildfires as the Earth rotated under the searing
388320	394640	hot plume. In a few hours, massive wildfires were probably burning around the globe. Some of them
394640	400400	may have lasted for months and turned Earth into a horrifying, hot, hellish version of itself.
401040	407200	As the day of the impact draws to an end, many of the dinosaurs are already dead, but the worst is
407200	414000	still to come. The gigantic plume of vaporized material reaches the upper atmosphere and spreads
414000	420320	around the whole globe. Together with the soot from the burning planet and the aerosols generated
420320	426640	at impact, the planet sinks into a deep darkness, with only the remaining raging fires illuminating
426640	433440	the scenery. Whatever plants survive the firestorms will now be starved for sunlight, as global
433440	440800	photosynthesis is temporarily shut down. Within days, temperatures crash as much as 25 degrees Celsius.
441680	447840	The oceans were especially hard hit. The lack of sunlight killed over 90 percent of plankton,
447840	453440	which formed the basis of the food web of marine life. Ultimately, this would kill off the large
453440	459440	marine reptiles and ammonites that used to dominate the seas. The biosphere that survivors
459440	466240	now find themselves in is like an alien landscape. Ash, debris, and the burned remains of the formerly
466240	473600	lush and blooming life cover the ground. The sky is dark and it's cold and fresh food is scarce,
473600	480240	while fungi thrive. For months and years, the planet will be a hostile and deadly place.
480800	488000	The sudden global winter will last for decades. At least 75 percent of all species on earth
488000	495360	will just vanish from existence. And so, as the day ends, the world is suddenly different.
496240	504000	The continuity that went on for millions of years is no more. The era of the dinosaurs is over.
504000	512240	Just like that. Eventually, from the ashes of the old world, survivors emerged. Birds that are the
512240	517840	direct descendants of the dinosaurs and mammals that would eventually become the dominant animals
517840	524080	on the planet. Without the asteroid, who knows what life on earth would look like today? Without
524080	530000	the sudden disruption of dinosaur continuity that completely changed the planet and all life on it,
530560	534080	we might have never had the opportunity to become what we are today.
535680	542720	It's not clear how long the human era will last. So far, modern humans have been around for 0.1
542720	548160	percent of the time the dinosaurs were. And in this short amount of time, we've achieved
548160	554880	impressive feats. From making the world our own, to reaching space and splitting the atom. Yet,
554880	562080	our future and our long-term survival are not a given. If we're not careful, it could end in an
562080	568800	instant, like the age of the dinosaurs ended. But in contrast to them, we know that our continuity
568800	576080	is fragile, even if it doesn't feel like it. We can be prepared and be vigilant and hopeful.
576080	581120	If we're lucky, our journey will go on for a long, long time.
583360	587680	Speaking of journeys, we want to address something in the spirit of transparency.
588320	593360	Quadska's art has changed in the last two years. We've become more than a YouTube channel or
593360	598480	animation studio and now also run a paper shop that sells hundreds of thousands of calendars,
598480	604080	posters and notebooks. That's not a happy accident, many of us have a background in graphic design.
604800	608880	Paper products are our roots and we actually started out creating posters,
608880	613680	books and print infographics. We love that you can touch them, smell them,
613680	619120	nerd about small details and printing techniques. Just like the channel, we started small and
619120	624720	without great ambition. Step by step, we found the right printers and papers, learned about shipping
624720	630000	and expanded our shop. We put a huge amount of research, love and hours into it, because this
630000	634240	is the only way we know how to do things. We don't just want to make generic merch,
634240	639600	we want to make things that fit our mission of making science exciting and creating beautiful
639600	646800	things. Things that persist and are made with high quality and love. Our shop gives us another outlet
646800	652560	to do this and as a nice side effect has turned into our main source of income for everything we
652560	659520	do on this channel, which also keeps us independent and our videos free for everyone. So we want to
659600	665680	build further on that and create more things that last. We've just started a new notebook line
665680	670640	called Pocket Log that we'll expand on in the future. The first edition is a dinosaur themed
670640	675440	collection that will hopefully serve a future paleontologist well. There are loads of plans
675440	681920	for sciency stuff, more journals and calendars and infographics. Let us know what you would like us to
681920	689600	make for your room, kids, classrooms and yourself. In the end, the things we do work because you like
689600	695040	them and because you enable us to put thousands of hours into videos and hundreds of hours into
695040	700960	posters and journals. Thank you so much for that. We're looking forward to making fun sciency stuff
700960	719040	for you, no matter if it's a video, a poster or something else entirely. Thank you for watching.
