1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How big is the Moon?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,280
In the night sky, the Moon seems rather small.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,680
But in reality, it really isn't.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
Central Europe would easily fit under it.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
The surface area of the Moon is huge.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,360
To give you some perspective, it's as big as the whole European continent,

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,960
China, the USA, Brazil, and South Africa together.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Weight-wise, the Moon is only about 1.81 of the mass of Earth.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,240
But how big is it in relation to Earth?

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
Quite big, actually.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Our Moon is the biggest in the Solar System in relation to its planet.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
And it's the fifth largest Moon in the Solar System,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
quite a bit bigger than the dwarf planet Pluto.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,800
Now, if the Moon is really that huge,

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
how far away is it from us to seem this small in the night sky?

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,560
370 kilometers, as far as the ISS may be?

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
No, at that distance, gravitational forces would rip the Moon apart.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,720
At 36,000 kilometers, it would be as far away as our most distant satellites.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
Let's adjust the distance to reality.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
Pretty far away, right?

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
A 747 would need 28 straight days to fly to the Moon,

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,240
and even with our current technology, we'd need two full days.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
And in a car, a lot of time.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
So how big is the Moon?

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
Well, it kind of depends how you define big.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,440
But seriously, though, it's pretty big.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey YouTube, we'll try something new this month.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Moon May.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,080
One video about cool Moon stuff each Monday in May.

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,840
So, see you next week.
