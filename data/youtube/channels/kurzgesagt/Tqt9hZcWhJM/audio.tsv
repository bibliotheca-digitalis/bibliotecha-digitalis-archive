0	2000	How big is the Moon?
2000	5280	In the night sky, the Moon seems rather small.
5280	7680	But in reality, it really isn't.
7680	10320	Central Europe would easily fit under it.
10320	13360	The surface area of the Moon is huge.
13360	17360	To give you some perspective, it's as big as the whole European continent,
17360	20960	China, the USA, Brazil, and South Africa together.
20960	25760	Weight-wise, the Moon is only about 1.81 of the mass of Earth.
25760	28240	But how big is it in relation to Earth?
28240	29680	Quite big, actually.
29760	33760	Our Moon is the biggest in the Solar System in relation to its planet.
33760	37360	And it's the fifth largest Moon in the Solar System,
37360	39440	quite a bit bigger than the dwarf planet Pluto.
40080	42800	Now, if the Moon is really that huge,
42800	46480	how far away is it from us to seem this small in the night sky?
47040	50560	370 kilometers, as far as the ISS may be?
51120	55440	No, at that distance, gravitational forces would rip the Moon apart.
56240	60720	At 36,000 kilometers, it would be as far away as our most distant satellites.
61440	63520	Let's adjust the distance to reality.
64400	65920	Pretty far away, right?
65920	69680	A 747 would need 28 straight days to fly to the Moon,
69680	74240	and even with our current technology, we'd need two full days.
74240	76800	And in a car, a lot of time.
77520	79120	So how big is the Moon?
80080	82960	Well, it kind of depends how you define big.
82960	87440	But seriously, though, it's pretty big.
89440	92000	Hey YouTube, we'll try something new this month.
92000	92960	Moon May.
92960	96080	One video about cool Moon stuff each Monday in May.
96080	99840	So, see you next week.
