0	3440	Have you ever been in an argument about nuclear power?
3440	6720	We have, and we found it frustrating and confusing,
6720	9360	so let's try and get to grips with this topic.
16000	18160	It all started in the 1940s.
18160	21360	After the shock and horror of the war and the use of the atomic bomb,
21360	25040	nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful spin-off of the new technology,
25040	27280	helping the world get back on its feet.
27360	30000	Everyone's imagination was running wild.
30000	32080	Would electricity become free?
32080	34720	Could nuclear power help settle the Antarctic?
34720	38800	Would there be nuclear-powered cars, planes, or houses?
38800	41760	It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away.
42320	43680	One thing was certain.
43680	45600	The future was atomic.
46240	49920	Just a few years later, there was a sort of atomic age hangover.
49920	55200	As it turned out, nuclear power was very complicated and very expensive.
55280	60240	Turning physics into engineering was easy on paper, but hard in real life.
60240	65120	Also, private companies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment.
65120	68560	Most of them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil.
68560	72560	But there were many people who didn't just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age.
72560	76800	An exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity,
76800	81680	the prospect of being independent of oil and gas imports, and in some cases,
81680	87040	a secret desire to possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going.
87680	92080	Nuclear power's finest hour finally came in the early 1970s,
92080	96560	when war in the Middle East caused oil prices to skyrocket worldwide.
96560	100960	Now, commercial interest and investment picked up at a dazzling pace.
100960	106640	More than half of all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985.
106640	110880	But which type of reactor to build, given how many different types there were to choose from?
111360	116000	A surprising underdog candidate won the day, the light-water reactor.
116000	119760	It wasn't very innovative, and it wasn't too popular with scientists,
119760	122240	but it had some decisive advantages.
122240	125920	It was there, it worked, and it wasn't terribly expensive.
126480	128640	So, what does a light-water reactor do?
129200	131760	Well, the basic principle is shockingly simple.
131760	134960	It heats up water using an artificial chain reaction.
135600	140800	Nuclear fission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could.
140800	146640	Really heavy elements on the brink of stability, like uranium-235, get bombarded with neutrons.
146640	150400	The neutron is absorbed, but the result is unstable.
150400	154400	Most of the time, it immediately splits into fast-moving, lighter elements,
154400	158720	some additional free neutrons, and energy in the form of radiation.
158720	163600	The radiation heats the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms,
163600	168160	releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction.
168160	173040	Very different from the fast, destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb.
173040	178240	In our light-water reactor, a moderator is needed to control the neutron's energy.
178240	181520	Simple, ordinary water does the job, which is very practical,
181520	184320	since water is used to drive the turbines anyway.
184320	188160	The light-water reactor became prevalent because it's simple and cheap.
188160	193600	However, it's neither the safest, most efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.
193600	197200	The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade, though.
197200	201280	In 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania
201280	204400	barely escaped a catastrophe when its core melted.
204400	209920	In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened Central Europe with a radioactive cloud,
209920	215120	and in 2011, the drawn-out Fukushima disaster sparked new discussions and concerns.
215680	220720	While in the 1980s, 218 new nuclear power reactors went live,
220720	224560	their number and nuclear's global share of electricity production
224560	227760	has stagnated since the end of the 80s.
227760	229360	So what's the situation today?
229920	234560	Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of the world's energy demand.
234560	239120	There are about 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries.
239120	242720	About 70 new reactors are under construction in 2015,
242720	245280	most of them in countries which are growing quickly.
245280	249760	All in all, 160 new reactors are planned worldwide.
249760	254400	Most nuclear reactors were built more than 25 years ago with pretty old technology.
254800	258800	More than 80% are various types of light-water reactor.
258800	261680	Today, many countries are faced with a choice.
261680	264480	The expensive replacement of the aging reactors,
264480	267360	possibly with more efficient but less tested models,
267360	271680	or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older technology
271680	274480	with different cost and environmental impacts.
274480	276800	So, should we use nuclear energy?
277360	281280	The pro and contra arguments will be presented here next week.
