00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Have you ever been in an argument about nuclear power?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,720
We have, and we found it frustrating and confusing,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
so let's try and get to grips with this topic.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
It all started in the 1940s.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,360
After the shock and horror of the war and the use of the atomic bomb,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,040
nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful spin-off of the new technology,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,280
helping the world get back on its feet.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,000
Everyone's imagination was running wild.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,080
Would electricity become free?

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,720
Could nuclear power help settle the Antarctic?

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,800
Would there be nuclear-powered cars, planes, or houses?

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,760
It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
One thing was certain.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,600
The future was atomic.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,920
Just a few years later, there was a sort of atomic age hangover.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,200
As it turned out, nuclear power was very complicated and very expensive.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,240
Turning physics into engineering was easy on paper, but hard in real life.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,120
Also, private companies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,560
Most of them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
But there were many people who didn't just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,800
An exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,680
the prospect of being independent of oil and gas imports, and in some cases,

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,040
a secret desire to possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,080
Nuclear power's finest hour finally came in the early 1970s,

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,560
when war in the Middle East caused oil prices to skyrocket worldwide.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Now, commercial interest and investment picked up at a dazzling pace.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,640
More than half of all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
But which type of reactor to build, given how many different types there were to choose from?

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,000
A surprising underdog candidate won the day, the light-water reactor.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,760
It wasn't very innovative, and it wasn't too popular with scientists,

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,240
but it had some decisive advantages.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
It was there, it worked, and it wasn't terribly expensive.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,640
So, what does a light-water reactor do?

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,760
Well, the basic principle is shockingly simple.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,960
It heats up water using an artificial chain reaction.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,800
Nuclear fission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Really heavy elements on the brink of stability, like uranium-235, get bombarded with neutrons.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
The neutron is absorbed, but the result is unstable.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Most of the time, it immediately splits into fast-moving, lighter elements,

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
some additional free neutrons, and energy in the form of radiation.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,600
The radiation heats the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms,

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,160
releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Very different from the fast, destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,240
In our light-water reactor, a moderator is needed to control the neutron's energy.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,520
Simple, ordinary water does the job, which is very practical,

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,320
since water is used to drive the turbines anyway.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
The light-water reactor became prevalent because it's simple and cheap.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,600
However, it's neither the safest, most efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,200
The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade, though.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
In 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
barely escaped a catastrophe when its core melted.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened Central Europe with a radioactive cloud,

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,120
and in 2011, the drawn-out Fukushima disaster sparked new discussions and concerns.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
While in the 1980s, 218 new nuclear power reactors went live,

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
their number and nuclear's global share of electricity production

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,760
has stagnated since the end of the 80s.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
So what's the situation today?

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,560
Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of the world's energy demand.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
There are about 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries.

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
About 70 new reactors are under construction in 2015,

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,280
most of them in countries which are growing quickly.

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,760
All in all, 160 new reactors are planned worldwide.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
Most nuclear reactors were built more than 25 years ago with pretty old technology.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,800
More than 80% are various types of light-water reactor.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Today, many countries are faced with a choice.

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,480
The expensive replacement of the aging reactors,

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,360
possibly with more efficient but less tested models,

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older technology

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
with different cost and environmental impacts.

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,800
So, should we use nuclear energy?

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,280
The pro and contra arguments will be presented here next week.
