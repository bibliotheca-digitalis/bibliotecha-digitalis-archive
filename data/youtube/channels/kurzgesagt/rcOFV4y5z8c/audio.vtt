00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Have you ever been in an argument about nuclear power?

00:03.440 --> 00:06.720
We have, and we found it frustrating and confusing,

00:06.720 --> 00:09.360
so let's try and get to grips with this topic.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.160
It all started in the 1940s.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.360
After the shock and horror of the war and the use of the atomic bomb,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.040
nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful spin-off of the new technology,

00:25.040 --> 00:27.280
helping the world get back on its feet.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.000
Everyone's imagination was running wild.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.080
Would electricity become free?

00:32.080 --> 00:34.720
Could nuclear power help settle the Antarctic?

00:34.720 --> 00:38.800
Would there be nuclear-powered cars, planes, or houses?

00:38.800 --> 00:41.760
It seemed that this was just a few years of hard work away.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.680
One thing was certain.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.600
The future was atomic.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.920
Just a few years later, there was a sort of atomic age hangover.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.200
As it turned out, nuclear power was very complicated and very expensive.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.240
Turning physics into engineering was easy on paper, but hard in real life.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.120
Also, private companies thought that nuclear power was much too risky as an investment.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.560
Most of them would much rather stick with gas, coal, and oil.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.560
But there were many people who didn't just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.800
An exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously cheap electricity,

01:16.800 --> 01:21.680
the prospect of being independent of oil and gas imports, and in some cases,

01:21.680 --> 01:27.040
a secret desire to possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation to keep going.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.080
Nuclear power's finest hour finally came in the early 1970s,

01:32.080 --> 01:36.560
when war in the Middle East caused oil prices to skyrocket worldwide.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.960
Now, commercial interest and investment picked up at a dazzling pace.

01:40.960 --> 01:46.640
More than half of all the nuclear reactors in the world were built between 1970 and 1985.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.880
But which type of reactor to build, given how many different types there were to choose from?

01:51.360 --> 01:56.000
A surprising underdog candidate won the day, the light-water reactor.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.760
It wasn't very innovative, and it wasn't too popular with scientists,

01:59.760 --> 02:02.240
but it had some decisive advantages.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.920
It was there, it worked, and it wasn't terribly expensive.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.640
So, what does a light-water reactor do?

02:09.200 --> 02:11.760
Well, the basic principle is shockingly simple.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.960
It heats up water using an artificial chain reaction.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.800
Nuclear fission releases several million times more energy than any chemical reaction could.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.640
Really heavy elements on the brink of stability, like uranium-235, get bombarded with neutrons.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.400
The neutron is absorbed, but the result is unstable.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.400
Most of the time, it immediately splits into fast-moving, lighter elements,

02:34.400 --> 02:38.720
some additional free neutrons, and energy in the form of radiation.

02:38.720 --> 02:43.600
The radiation heats the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms,

02:43.600 --> 02:48.160
releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.040
Very different from the fast, destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb.

02:53.040 --> 02:58.240
In our light-water reactor, a moderator is needed to control the neutron's energy.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.520
Simple, ordinary water does the job, which is very practical,

03:01.520 --> 03:04.320
since water is used to drive the turbines anyway.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.160
The light-water reactor became prevalent because it's simple and cheap.

03:08.160 --> 03:13.600
However, it's neither the safest, most efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.200
The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely a decade, though.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.280
In 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania

03:21.280 --> 03:24.400
barely escaped a catastrophe when its core melted.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.920
In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe directly threatened Central Europe with a radioactive cloud,

03:29.920 --> 03:35.120
and in 2011, the drawn-out Fukushima disaster sparked new discussions and concerns.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.720
While in the 1980s, 218 new nuclear power reactors went live,

03:40.720 --> 03:44.560
their number and nuclear's global share of electricity production

03:44.560 --> 03:47.760
has stagnated since the end of the 80s.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.360
So what's the situation today?

03:49.920 --> 03:54.560
Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of the world's energy demand.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.120
There are about 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.720
About 70 new reactors are under construction in 2015,

04:02.720 --> 04:05.280
most of them in countries which are growing quickly.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.760
All in all, 160 new reactors are planned worldwide.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.400
Most nuclear reactors were built more than 25 years ago with pretty old technology.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.800
More than 80% are various types of light-water reactor.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.680
Today, many countries are faced with a choice.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.480
The expensive replacement of the aging reactors,

04:24.480 --> 04:27.360
possibly with more efficient but less tested models,

04:27.360 --> 04:31.680
or a move away from nuclear power towards newer or older technology

04:31.680 --> 04:34.480
with different cost and environmental impacts.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.800
So, should we use nuclear energy?

04:37.360 --> 04:41.280
The pro and contra arguments will be presented here next week.
