00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
What would you say if we told you that humanity is currently making a collaborative effort to engineer the perfect super bug?

00:07.280 --> 00:09.780
A bug that could kill hundreds of millions of people.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.620
Well, it is happening right now. We are in the process of creating a super bacterium.

00:16.620 --> 00:31.420
Bacteria are among the oldest living things on this planet. The smallest thing we still consider life,

00:31.420 --> 00:34.820
they are masters of survival and can be found everywhere.

00:34.820 --> 00:41.060
Most bacteria are harmless to us. Your body hosts trillions of them and they help you to survive.

00:41.060 --> 00:45.040
But others can invade your body, spread quickly and kill you.

00:45.760 --> 00:52.280
Millions of people used to die as a result of bacterial infections until we developed a super weapon, antibiotics.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.000
Together with vaccinations, antibiotics revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives.

00:59.080 --> 01:07.040
Antibiotics kill the vast majority of susceptible bacteria fairly quickly, leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system then deals with easily.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.480
How do antibiotics do this?

01:10.080 --> 01:16.640
Imagine a bacterium as a very complex machine with thousands of complex processes going on that keep it alive and active.

01:17.680 --> 01:24.440
Antibiotics disrupt this complex machinery, for example by interfering with its metabolism, slowing down their growth significantly,

01:24.440 --> 01:32.120
so they are less of a threat. Other antibiotics attack DNA and prevent it from being replicated, which stops bacteria from multiplying,

01:32.440 --> 01:39.280
ultimately killing them. Or by simply ripping the outer layer of the bacteria to shreds so that their insides spill out and they die.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.080
Quickly. All of this without bothering body cells.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.040
But now evolution is making things more complicated.

01:47.760 --> 01:54.840
By pure random chance, a small minority of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved a way to protect themselves.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.160
For example, by intercepting the antibiotics and changing the molecule so it becomes harmless.

02:00.520 --> 02:06.080
Or by investing energy in pumps that eject the antibiotics before they can do damage.

02:06.560 --> 02:11.320
A few immune bacteria are not that big a deal because the immune system can take care of them.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.960
But if they escape, they might spread their immunity.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.640
How can bacteria spread immunity?

02:18.080 --> 02:24.600
First of all, bacteria have two kinds of DNA. The chromosome and small free-floating parts called plasmids.

02:25.160 --> 02:30.120
They can hug each other and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful abilities.

02:30.600 --> 02:36.180
This way immunity can be spread quickly through a population. Or in a process called transformation,

02:36.360 --> 02:39.760
bacteria can harvest dead bacteria and collect DNA pieces.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.720
This even works between different bacteria species and can lead to superbugs.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.320
Bacteria that are immune to multiple antibiotics.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.220
A variety of superbugs already exist in the world. Especially hospitals are the perfect breeding grounds for them.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.940
Humans have short memories. The horrors of the pre-antibiotic era have been forgotten.

03:01.580 --> 03:08.300
Today, we treat this powerful medicine as a commodity instead of as the game-changing achievement of science that it is.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.860
This has led to a strange disconnect.

03:11.460 --> 03:15.740
Hundreds of millions of people still don't have access to antibiotics in developing countries.

03:16.020 --> 03:21.040
While in other parts of the world, antibiotics are prescribed too freely and taken without care.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.880
Antibiotics should be a last resort drug, not something you take because your cold is annoying.

03:27.720 --> 03:33.720
Another serious problem is antibiotic use in meat production. At any particular point in time,

03:34.100 --> 03:37.720
humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion animals as livestock.

03:38.080 --> 03:45.240
To make meat cheaper, many animals are held in horrible conditions in very tight spaces and in unhygienic conditions.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.500
The perfect breeding ground for a disease.

03:47.500 --> 03:55.340
So, many animals are given antibiotics to kill as many bacteria as possible and prevent them from getting sick because a

03:55.500 --> 03:57.500
cheeseburger has to cost a dollar.

03:58.060 --> 04:04.180
Unsurprisingly, as a result of this system, we have created more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

04:04.540 --> 04:09.380
To counteract this, we use different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon.

04:09.740 --> 04:14.620
There are specific antibiotics that are used to wipe out bacteria that have developed resistance.

04:14.900 --> 04:21.900
There are strict rules for using these to avoid the creation of a super bacterium, or so we thought.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.460
In late 2015, scary news arrived from China.

04:26.180 --> 04:30.140
Resistance against colistin, a last-ditch antibiotic, had been discovered.

04:30.700 --> 04:34.220
Colistin is an old drug and was rarely used because it can damage the liver.

04:34.540 --> 04:40.740
So, there was little resistance against it, which made it a great antibiotic of last resort for certain complex

04:40.900 --> 04:45.980
infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that have become immune to a whole bunch of other drugs.

04:46.860 --> 04:50.220
Bacteria resistance to colistin is very, very bad news.

04:50.220 --> 04:54.980
It might destroy a last line of defense and lead to a whole lot of dead people.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.180
How could this happen?

04:57.180 --> 05:00.820
Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms have been given colistin for years.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.500
Resistant bacteria developed, spreading first from animal to animal and then to humans without being noticed.

05:06.940 --> 05:13.100
On an average day, there are over 100,000 flights on Earth, kind of connecting every human on the planet.

05:13.660 --> 05:19.140
By creating the modern world, we have also built the infrastructure for a dangerous pandemic.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.900
Still, we don't need to panic just yet. Bacteria evolve, humans do research.

05:25.220 --> 05:30.700
New antibiotics are developed as old ones become obsolete, technology is advancing every day.

05:31.020 --> 05:34.420
The problem is real and serious, but the fight is far from over.

05:34.740 --> 05:40.700
If humanity plays its cards right, superbucks might turn out to be not very super after all.
