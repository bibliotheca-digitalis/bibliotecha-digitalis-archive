0	6960	What would you say if we told you that humanity is currently making a collaborative effort to engineer the perfect super bug?
7280	9780	A bug that could kill hundreds of millions of people.
10480	16620	Well, it is happening right now. We are in the process of creating a super bacterium.
16620	31420	Bacteria are among the oldest living things on this planet. The smallest thing we still consider life,
31420	34820	they are masters of survival and can be found everywhere.
34820	41060	Most bacteria are harmless to us. Your body hosts trillions of them and they help you to survive.
41060	45040	But others can invade your body, spread quickly and kill you.
45760	52280	Millions of people used to die as a result of bacterial infections until we developed a super weapon, antibiotics.
52920	58000	Together with vaccinations, antibiotics revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives.
59080	67040	Antibiotics kill the vast majority of susceptible bacteria fairly quickly, leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system then deals with easily.
67480	69480	How do antibiotics do this?
70080	76640	Imagine a bacterium as a very complex machine with thousands of complex processes going on that keep it alive and active.
77680	84440	Antibiotics disrupt this complex machinery, for example by interfering with its metabolism, slowing down their growth significantly,
84440	92120	so they are less of a threat. Other antibiotics attack DNA and prevent it from being replicated, which stops bacteria from multiplying,
92440	99280	ultimately killing them. Or by simply ripping the outer layer of the bacteria to shreds so that their insides spill out and they die.
99520	103080	Quickly. All of this without bothering body cells.
103680	107040	But now evolution is making things more complicated.
107760	114840	By pure random chance, a small minority of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved a way to protect themselves.
115200	120160	For example, by intercepting the antibiotics and changing the molecule so it becomes harmless.
120520	126080	Or by investing energy in pumps that eject the antibiotics before they can do damage.
126560	131320	A few immune bacteria are not that big a deal because the immune system can take care of them.
131720	134960	But if they escape, they might spread their immunity.
135640	137640	How can bacteria spread immunity?
138080	144600	First of all, bacteria have two kinds of DNA. The chromosome and small free-floating parts called plasmids.
145160	150120	They can hug each other and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful abilities.
150600	156180	This way immunity can be spread quickly through a population. Or in a process called transformation,
156360	159760	bacteria can harvest dead bacteria and collect DNA pieces.
160280	164720	This even works between different bacteria species and can lead to superbugs.
165280	168320	Bacteria that are immune to multiple antibiotics.
169200	175220	A variety of superbugs already exist in the world. Especially hospitals are the perfect breeding grounds for them.
175880	180940	Humans have short memories. The horrors of the pre-antibiotic era have been forgotten.
181580	188300	Today, we treat this powerful medicine as a commodity instead of as the game-changing achievement of science that it is.
188860	190860	This has led to a strange disconnect.
191460	195740	Hundreds of millions of people still don't have access to antibiotics in developing countries.
196020	201040	While in other parts of the world, antibiotics are prescribed too freely and taken without care.
201920	206880	Antibiotics should be a last resort drug, not something you take because your cold is annoying.
207720	213720	Another serious problem is antibiotic use in meat production. At any particular point in time,
214100	217720	humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion animals as livestock.
218080	225240	To make meat cheaper, many animals are held in horrible conditions in very tight spaces and in unhygienic conditions.
225320	227500	The perfect breeding ground for a disease.
227500	235340	So, many animals are given antibiotics to kill as many bacteria as possible and prevent them from getting sick because a
235500	237500	cheeseburger has to cost a dollar.
238060	244180	Unsurprisingly, as a result of this system, we have created more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
244540	249380	To counteract this, we use different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon.
249740	254620	There are specific antibiotics that are used to wipe out bacteria that have developed resistance.
254900	261900	There are strict rules for using these to avoid the creation of a super bacterium, or so we thought.
262300	265460	In late 2015, scary news arrived from China.
266180	270140	Resistance against colistin, a last-ditch antibiotic, had been discovered.
270700	274220	Colistin is an old drug and was rarely used because it can damage the liver.
274540	280740	So, there was little resistance against it, which made it a great antibiotic of last resort for certain complex
280900	285980	infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that have become immune to a whole bunch of other drugs.
286860	290220	Bacteria resistance to colistin is very, very bad news.
290220	294980	It might destroy a last line of defense and lead to a whole lot of dead people.
295420	297180	How could this happen?
297180	300820	Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms have been given colistin for years.
301300	306500	Resistant bacteria developed, spreading first from animal to animal and then to humans without being noticed.
306940	313100	On an average day, there are over 100,000 flights on Earth, kind of connecting every human on the planet.
313660	319140	By creating the modern world, we have also built the infrastructure for a dangerous pandemic.
319700	324900	Still, we don't need to panic just yet. Bacteria evolve, humans do research.
325220	330700	New antibiotics are developed as old ones become obsolete, technology is advancing every day.
331020	334420	The problem is real and serious, but the fight is far from over.
334740	340700	If humanity plays its cards right, superbucks might turn out to be not very super after all.
