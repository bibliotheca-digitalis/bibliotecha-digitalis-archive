1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
What would you say if we told you that humanity is currently making a collaborative effort to engineer the perfect super bug?

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,780
A bug that could kill hundreds of millions of people.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,620
Well, it is happening right now. We are in the process of creating a super bacterium.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:31,420
Bacteria are among the oldest living things on this planet. The smallest thing we still consider life,

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,820
they are masters of survival and can be found everywhere.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,060
Most bacteria are harmless to us. Your body hosts trillions of them and they help you to survive.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,040
But others can invade your body, spread quickly and kill you.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,280
Millions of people used to die as a result of bacterial infections until we developed a super weapon, antibiotics.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,000
Together with vaccinations, antibiotics revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives.

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:07,040
Antibiotics kill the vast majority of susceptible bacteria fairly quickly, leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system then deals with easily.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
How do antibiotics do this?

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
Imagine a bacterium as a very complex machine with thousands of complex processes going on that keep it alive and active.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Antibiotics disrupt this complex machinery, for example by interfering with its metabolism, slowing down their growth significantly,

14
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:32,120
so they are less of a threat. Other antibiotics attack DNA and prevent it from being replicated, which stops bacteria from multiplying,

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,280
ultimately killing them. Or by simply ripping the outer layer of the bacteria to shreds so that their insides spill out and they die.

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,080
Quickly. All of this without bothering body cells.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
But now evolution is making things more complicated.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,840
By pure random chance, a small minority of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved a way to protect themselves.

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,160
For example, by intercepting the antibiotics and changing the molecule so it becomes harmless.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Or by investing energy in pumps that eject the antibiotics before they can do damage.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,320
A few immune bacteria are not that big a deal because the immune system can take care of them.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,960
But if they escape, they might spread their immunity.

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
How can bacteria spread immunity?

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,600
First of all, bacteria have two kinds of DNA. The chromosome and small free-floating parts called plasmids.

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,120
They can hug each other and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful abilities.

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,180
This way immunity can be spread quickly through a population. Or in a process called transformation,

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,760
bacteria can harvest dead bacteria and collect DNA pieces.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,720
This even works between different bacteria species and can lead to superbugs.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,320
Bacteria that are immune to multiple antibiotics.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,220
A variety of superbugs already exist in the world. Especially hospitals are the perfect breeding grounds for them.

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,940
Humans have short memories. The horrors of the pre-antibiotic era have been forgotten.

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,300
Today, we treat this powerful medicine as a commodity instead of as the game-changing achievement of science that it is.

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,860
This has led to a strange disconnect.

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,740
Hundreds of millions of people still don't have access to antibiotics in developing countries.

35
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,040
While in other parts of the world, antibiotics are prescribed too freely and taken without care.

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,880
Antibiotics should be a last resort drug, not something you take because your cold is annoying.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Another serious problem is antibiotic use in meat production. At any particular point in time,

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,720
humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion animals as livestock.

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,240
To make meat cheaper, many animals are held in horrible conditions in very tight spaces and in unhygienic conditions.

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,500
The perfect breeding ground for a disease.

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,340
So, many animals are given antibiotics to kill as many bacteria as possible and prevent them from getting sick because a

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
cheeseburger has to cost a dollar.

43
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,180
Unsurprisingly, as a result of this system, we have created more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

44
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,380
To counteract this, we use different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon.

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,620
There are specific antibiotics that are used to wipe out bacteria that have developed resistance.

46
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,900
There are strict rules for using these to avoid the creation of a super bacterium, or so we thought.

47
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,460
In late 2015, scary news arrived from China.

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,140
Resistance against colistin, a last-ditch antibiotic, had been discovered.

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,220
Colistin is an old drug and was rarely used because it can damage the liver.

50
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,740
So, there was little resistance against it, which made it a great antibiotic of last resort for certain complex

51
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,980
infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that have become immune to a whole bunch of other drugs.

52
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,220
Bacteria resistance to colistin is very, very bad news.

53
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,980
It might destroy a last line of defense and lead to a whole lot of dead people.

54
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,180
How could this happen?

55
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,820
Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms have been given colistin for years.

56
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,500
Resistant bacteria developed, spreading first from animal to animal and then to humans without being noticed.

57
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,100
On an average day, there are over 100,000 flights on Earth, kind of connecting every human on the planet.

58
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,140
By creating the modern world, we have also built the infrastructure for a dangerous pandemic.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,900
Still, we don't need to panic just yet. Bacteria evolve, humans do research.

60
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,700
New antibiotics are developed as old ones become obsolete, technology is advancing every day.

61
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,420
The problem is real and serious, but the fight is far from over.

62
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,700
If humanity plays its cards right, superbucks might turn out to be not very super after all.
