00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Look around the room you're sitting in right now.

00:02.720 --> 00:05.760
Let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand,

00:05.760 --> 00:08.400
billions of grains of rice, hundreds of thousands

00:08.400 --> 00:10.560
of grapes, a few thousand apples,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.320
and a dozen watermelons.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.760
This is what the inside of your cells looks like.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.400
In terms of numbers, they're mostly

00:17.400 --> 00:20.640
filled up with water molecules, the grains of sand.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.000
Water gives the cells insides the consistency of soft jelly

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
and enables other things to move around easily.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.720
Almost all the other things, the rice and fruit,

00:29.720 --> 00:32.600
are proteins, several billion in total,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.760
more than 10,000 different kinds,

00:34.760 --> 00:37.000
depending on the function of the cell.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.600
Your cells are basically protein robots, as is all life, really.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.640
In fact, all solid non-fat parts of your body

00:44.640 --> 00:47.920
are mostly made out of protein, even your bones.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.440
Proteins are dead things that make life happen.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.400
How does this work?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.480
The language of life.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.240
Cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.560
Get food in and waste out, grow and build structures,

01:03.560 --> 01:06.040
escape danger or react to stimuli,

01:06.040 --> 01:08.640
make copies of themselves, and so on.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.040
All of this is done by speaking the language of life.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.000
And the words of this language are proteins.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.360
This is how this language works in a nutshell.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.480
It all begins with amino acids, tiny organic molecules.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.280
They're the alphabet of the language of life.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.600
There are 21 different ones, like different letters.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.920
Amino acid A, amino acid B, C, and so on.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.840
If you put around 50 amino acids together, they form a protein,

01:36.840 --> 01:39.640
which in the language of life is a word.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.320
And if you put many of these protein words together,

01:42.320 --> 01:46.280
you get a sentence called a biological pathway.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.840
Let's oversimplify a bit and say, for example,

01:48.840 --> 01:52.200
your cell needs to break down sugar with the language of life.

01:52.200 --> 01:57.640
It may take the amino acids for the letters B, R, E, A, and K

01:57.680 --> 02:00.360
to form the protein word break.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.240
Then combine this word with other protein words

02:03.240 --> 02:05.960
to form a biological pathway sentence

02:05.960 --> 02:08.960
that means break down sugar.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.200
In reality, this language of life is so complex

02:12.200 --> 02:14.120
that it defies imagination.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.040
You need to know about 8,000 words

02:16.040 --> 02:18.160
to speak a human language really well.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.080
But in the language of life, there are an estimated 20,000.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.920
And while the average English word has five letters,

02:24.960 --> 02:29.640
human proteins have an average of 375 amino acids.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.920
The longest protein has more than 30,000.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.560
And cells need to execute thousands of steps

02:36.560 --> 02:37.960
at any moment.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.760
If they ever stop speaking the language of life, they die.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.360
OK, but how do mindless cells speak a language this complex?

02:46.360 --> 02:48.720
Let's dive a little deeper.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.560
There are 21 amino acids that can

02:50.560 --> 02:52.960
be combined to form proteins.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.240
And proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds

02:55.240 --> 02:57.520
to thousands of amino acids.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.680
For the average protein length of a human cell

02:59.680 --> 03:04.360
of 375 amino acids, you get a stunning 6.8 times

03:04.360 --> 03:09.360
10 to the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make,

03:09.360 --> 03:13.560
a quadrillion googol, googol, googol, googol times more

03:13.560 --> 03:16.480
than there are atoms in the universe.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.000
Most of these possible proteins are useless.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.120
Just like with human language, most random letter combinations

03:22.120 --> 03:23.400
are just gibberish.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.000
So you need to know which words, which proteins,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
make up a language to speak it properly.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.280
And this is the job of your DNA, a long sequence

03:32.280 --> 03:34.360
of instructions.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.520
If you untangle the cell's DNA, it

03:36.520 --> 03:38.520
would be about two meters long.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.520
All of your body's DNA combined into one long string

03:41.520 --> 03:44.960
would reach to the sun and back over 20 times.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.120
Around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes,

03:48.120 --> 03:50.160
which are basically protein dictionaries that

03:50.160 --> 03:52.320
contain all the words of the language of life

03:52.320 --> 03:54.040
your cells speak.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.080
But genes are also the building manuals

03:56.080 --> 03:59.400
for all the proteins your cells need to function.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.080
The rest of your DNA is probably not useless,

04:02.080 --> 04:04.400
but basically like a set of rules.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.360
It's like the book of grammar of the language of life.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.400
Which proteins need to be built at which time?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.320
How many of them do you need?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.600
Which protein words go together and why?

04:15.600 --> 04:20.680
OK, letters, words, sentences, dictionary, and grammar.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.360
But of course, this is all just a metaphor for something

04:23.360 --> 04:25.600
mind-numbingly complex.

04:25.600 --> 04:30.080
Let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.120
How dead proteins make life.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.240
Now that we have some basic principles,

04:35.240 --> 04:38.000
we have a chance to understand how dead things make life

04:38.000 --> 04:39.080
together.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.160
And for that, we need a fundamental force

04:41.160 --> 04:44.360
of the universe, electromagnetism.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.080
The elementary particles that make up

04:46.080 --> 04:48.280
atoms, which make up amino acids,

04:48.280 --> 04:51.880
have different charges that attract or repel each other.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.080
The 21 different amino acids all have slightly different

04:55.080 --> 04:56.360
charges.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.120
Some are more negative, others more positive.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.040
When your cells build proteins, they

05:02.040 --> 05:04.560
put different amino acids together in chains,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.560
basically long strings.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.120
Now because of the different charges of the amino acids

05:09.120 --> 05:12.680
used, these strings begin to fold in on themselves.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.840
This folding process is so complex

05:14.840 --> 05:16.680
that we still haven't completely understood

05:16.680 --> 05:18.360
how exactly it works.

05:18.360 --> 05:23.360
But in a nutshell, 1D strings become 3D structures.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.280
Proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces

05:26.280 --> 05:28.400
with a very specific shape.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.360
In the world of proteins, shape is everything.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.280
Because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein

05:34.280 --> 05:36.520
are charged in which way, and this

05:36.520 --> 05:40.080
determines how it can interact with other proteins.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.400
All of these differently charged puzzle pieces

05:42.400 --> 05:45.320
can snap together or repel each other.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.240
When they snap together, their charge

05:47.240 --> 05:50.280
changes, which can make them change their shape, which then

05:50.280 --> 05:54.840
makes them a new protein, a new tool that can do new things.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.280
This is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.760
You can do basically everything with them.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.920
They can snap together like LEGO pieces

06:02.920 --> 06:04.920
to build complex structures.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.720
They can dismantle things.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.960
They can form complex micro machines

06:08.960 --> 06:11.480
that use energy to do work.

06:11.480 --> 06:15.240
And maybe most stunningly, they can convey information.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.400
Let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.640
There may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.400
If the protein finds that toxin, it changes its shape.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.520
With that new shape, it can now snap into a different protein

06:28.520 --> 06:30.400
that changes its shape again.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.840
This new protein activates a micro machine

06:32.840 --> 06:35.560
that directly binds to your DNA to order

06:35.560 --> 06:37.880
the production of a special protein which acts

06:37.880 --> 06:40.120
as an antidote to the toxin.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.640
This cascade of interaction is the pathway

06:42.640 --> 06:44.760
we spoke about earlier, a sentence

06:44.760 --> 06:46.960
in the language of life.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.280
So without a single active thought,

06:49.280 --> 06:53.040
proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.560
In reality, these pathways can have dozens

06:55.560 --> 06:57.760
to hundreds of steps.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.720
How life operates is so incredibly awe inducing.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.640
Somehow, mind numbingly complex interactions

07:04.640 --> 07:08.640
between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less

07:08.640 --> 07:10.000
dead cell.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.640
Somewhere around here, life happens.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.760
But we still don't know what life is.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.840
How dumb things are smart together.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.200
We need another analogy.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.200
So let's talk about ants.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.800
Ants share a fundamental property with cells.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.520
They are really dumb.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.320
A single ant will just stumble around uselessly.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.160
But if you put a lot of ants together,

07:31.160 --> 07:34.320
they exchange information and do amazing things.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.600
Constructing complex structures, organizing themselves,

07:37.600 --> 07:40.600
caring for broods, or attacking enemies.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.240
Although dumb individually, together, they

07:43.240 --> 07:45.240
become something greater.

07:45.240 --> 07:49.480
This phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.080
It's the observation that entities

07:51.080 --> 07:55.560
have properties and abilities that their parts do not have.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.160
This is how everything in your body works.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.160
Your cells are bags of proteins guided by chemistry.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.200
But together, these proteins form

08:04.200 --> 08:08.520
a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things.

08:08.520 --> 08:12.240
Cells are mindless robots that are even dumber than ants.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.240
But many of them acting together form specialized tissue

08:15.240 --> 08:18.600
and organ systems, from muscles that make your heart beat

08:18.600 --> 08:21.360
to brain cells that make you think.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.080
If you look outside at the incredible dimension

08:24.080 --> 08:28.400
and scale of space, a place where forever is a real thing,

08:28.400 --> 08:31.600
it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.120
Not special.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.920
But if you look inside into what you really are,

08:35.920 --> 08:39.600
you just discover almost indescribable complexity,

08:39.600 --> 08:44.200
the beautiful language of life.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.720
Almost everything in the universe reveals hidden layers of complexity

08:47.720 --> 08:51.440
if you look closer and if you have the knowledge to understand it.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.640
