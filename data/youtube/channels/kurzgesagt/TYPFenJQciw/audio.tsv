0	2720	Look around the room you're sitting in right now.
2720	5760	Let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand,
5760	8400	billions of grains of rice, hundreds of thousands
8400	10560	of grapes, a few thousand apples,
10560	12320	and a dozen watermelons.
12320	15760	This is what the inside of your cells looks like.
15760	17400	In terms of numbers, they're mostly
17400	20640	filled up with water molecules, the grains of sand.
20640	24000	Water gives the cells insides the consistency of soft jelly
24000	27000	and enables other things to move around easily.
27000	29720	Almost all the other things, the rice and fruit,
29720	32600	are proteins, several billion in total,
32600	34760	more than 10,000 different kinds,
34760	37000	depending on the function of the cell.
37000	41600	Your cells are basically protein robots, as is all life, really.
41600	44640	In fact, all solid non-fat parts of your body
44640	47920	are mostly made out of protein, even your bones.
47920	51440	Proteins are dead things that make life happen.
51440	53400	How does this work?
53400	55480	The language of life.
55480	59240	Cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive.
59280	63560	Get food in and waste out, grow and build structures,
63560	66040	escape danger or react to stimuli,
66040	68640	make copies of themselves, and so on.
68640	72040	All of this is done by speaking the language of life.
72040	75000	And the words of this language are proteins.
75000	78360	This is how this language works in a nutshell.
78360	82480	It all begins with amino acids, tiny organic molecules.
82480	85280	They're the alphabet of the language of life.
85280	88600	There are 21 different ones, like different letters.
88600	92920	Amino acid A, amino acid B, C, and so on.
92920	96840	If you put around 50 amino acids together, they form a protein,
96840	99640	which in the language of life is a word.
99640	102320	And if you put many of these protein words together,
102320	106280	you get a sentence called a biological pathway.
106280	108840	Let's oversimplify a bit and say, for example,
108840	112200	your cell needs to break down sugar with the language of life.
112200	117640	It may take the amino acids for the letters B, R, E, A, and K
117680	120360	to form the protein word break.
120360	123240	Then combine this word with other protein words
123240	125960	to form a biological pathway sentence
125960	128960	that means break down sugar.
128960	132200	In reality, this language of life is so complex
132200	134120	that it defies imagination.
134120	136040	You need to know about 8,000 words
136040	138160	to speak a human language really well.
138160	142080	But in the language of life, there are an estimated 20,000.
142080	144920	And while the average English word has five letters,
144960	149640	human proteins have an average of 375 amino acids.
149640	153920	The longest protein has more than 30,000.
153920	156560	And cells need to execute thousands of steps
156560	157960	at any moment.
157960	161760	If they ever stop speaking the language of life, they die.
161760	166360	OK, but how do mindless cells speak a language this complex?
166360	168720	Let's dive a little deeper.
168720	170560	There are 21 amino acids that can
170560	172960	be combined to form proteins.
172960	175240	And proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds
175240	177520	to thousands of amino acids.
177520	179680	For the average protein length of a human cell
179680	184360	of 375 amino acids, you get a stunning 6.8 times
184360	189360	10 to the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make,
189360	193560	a quadrillion googol, googol, googol, googol times more
193560	196480	than there are atoms in the universe.
196480	199000	Most of these possible proteins are useless.
199000	202120	Just like with human language, most random letter combinations
202120	203400	are just gibberish.
203400	206000	So you need to know which words, which proteins,
206000	209000	make up a language to speak it properly.
209000	212280	And this is the job of your DNA, a long sequence
212280	214360	of instructions.
214360	216520	If you untangle the cell's DNA, it
216520	218520	would be about two meters long.
218520	221520	All of your body's DNA combined into one long string
221520	224960	would reach to the sun and back over 20 times.
224960	228120	Around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes,
228120	230160	which are basically protein dictionaries that
230160	232320	contain all the words of the language of life
232320	234040	your cells speak.
234040	236080	But genes are also the building manuals
236080	239400	for all the proteins your cells need to function.
239400	242080	The rest of your DNA is probably not useless,
242080	244400	but basically like a set of rules.
244400	247360	It's like the book of grammar of the language of life.
247360	250400	Which proteins need to be built at which time?
250400	252320	How many of them do you need?
252320	255600	Which protein words go together and why?
255600	260680	OK, letters, words, sentences, dictionary, and grammar.
260680	263360	But of course, this is all just a metaphor for something
263360	265600	mind-numbingly complex.
265600	270080	Let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality.
270080	273120	How dead proteins make life.
273120	275240	Now that we have some basic principles,
275240	278000	we have a chance to understand how dead things make life
278000	279080	together.
279080	281160	And for that, we need a fundamental force
281160	284360	of the universe, electromagnetism.
284360	286080	The elementary particles that make up
286080	288280	atoms, which make up amino acids,
288280	291880	have different charges that attract or repel each other.
291880	295080	The 21 different amino acids all have slightly different
295080	296360	charges.
296360	300120	Some are more negative, others more positive.
300120	302040	When your cells build proteins, they
302040	304560	put different amino acids together in chains,
304560	306560	basically long strings.
306560	309120	Now because of the different charges of the amino acids
309120	312680	used, these strings begin to fold in on themselves.
312680	314840	This folding process is so complex
314840	316680	that we still haven't completely understood
316680	318360	how exactly it works.
318360	323360	But in a nutshell, 1D strings become 3D structures.
323360	326280	Proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces
326280	328400	with a very specific shape.
328400	331360	In the world of proteins, shape is everything.
331360	334280	Because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein
334280	336520	are charged in which way, and this
336520	340080	determines how it can interact with other proteins.
340080	342400	All of these differently charged puzzle pieces
342400	345320	can snap together or repel each other.
345320	347240	When they snap together, their charge
347240	350280	changes, which can make them change their shape, which then
350280	354840	makes them a new protein, a new tool that can do new things.
354840	358280	This is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful.
358280	360760	You can do basically everything with them.
360760	362920	They can snap together like LEGO pieces
362920	364920	to build complex structures.
364920	366720	They can dismantle things.
366720	368960	They can form complex micro machines
368960	371480	that use energy to do work.
371480	375240	And maybe most stunningly, they can convey information.
375240	378400	Let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell.
378400	381640	There may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin.
381640	385400	If the protein finds that toxin, it changes its shape.
385400	388520	With that new shape, it can now snap into a different protein
388520	390400	that changes its shape again.
390400	392840	This new protein activates a micro machine
392840	395560	that directly binds to your DNA to order
395560	397880	the production of a special protein which acts
397880	400120	as an antidote to the toxin.
400160	402640	This cascade of interaction is the pathway
402640	404760	we spoke about earlier, a sentence
404760	406960	in the language of life.
406960	409280	So without a single active thought,
409280	413040	proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life.
413040	415560	In reality, these pathways can have dozens
415560	417760	to hundreds of steps.
417760	421720	How life operates is so incredibly awe inducing.
421720	424640	Somehow, mind numbingly complex interactions
424640	428640	between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less
428640	430000	dead cell.
430000	432640	Somewhere around here, life happens.
432640	435760	But we still don't know what life is.
435760	438840	How dumb things are smart together.
438840	440200	We need another analogy.
440200	442200	So let's talk about ants.
442200	444800	Ants share a fundamental property with cells.
444800	446520	They are really dumb.
446520	449320	A single ant will just stumble around uselessly.
449320	451160	But if you put a lot of ants together,
451160	454320	they exchange information and do amazing things.
454320	457600	Constructing complex structures, organizing themselves,
457600	460600	caring for broods, or attacking enemies.
460600	463240	Although dumb individually, together, they
463240	465240	become something greater.
465240	469480	This phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence.
469480	471080	It's the observation that entities
471080	475560	have properties and abilities that their parts do not have.
475560	478160	This is how everything in your body works.
478160	482160	Your cells are bags of proteins guided by chemistry.
482160	484200	But together, these proteins form
484200	488520	a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things.
488520	492240	Cells are mindless robots that are even dumber than ants.
492240	495240	But many of them acting together form specialized tissue
495240	498600	and organ systems, from muscles that make your heart beat
498600	501360	to brain cells that make you think.
501360	504080	If you look outside at the incredible dimension
504080	508400	and scale of space, a place where forever is a real thing,
508400	511600	it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small.
511600	513120	Not special.
513120	515920	But if you look inside into what you really are,
515920	519600	you just discover almost indescribable complexity,
519600	524200	the beautiful language of life.
524200	527720	Almost everything in the universe reveals hidden layers of complexity
527720	531440	if you look closer and if you have the knowledge to understand it.
