1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Look around the room you're sitting in right now.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,760
Let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,400
billions of grains of rice, hundreds of thousands

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,560
of grapes, a few thousand apples,

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,320
and a dozen watermelons.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,760
This is what the inside of your cells looks like.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,400
In terms of numbers, they're mostly

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,640
filled up with water molecules, the grains of sand.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
Water gives the cells insides the consistency of soft jelly

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and enables other things to move around easily.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Almost all the other things, the rice and fruit,

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,600
are proteins, several billion in total,

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,760
more than 10,000 different kinds,

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,000
depending on the function of the cell.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,600
Your cells are basically protein robots, as is all life, really.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,640
In fact, all solid non-fat parts of your body

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
are mostly made out of protein, even your bones.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
Proteins are dead things that make life happen.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,400
How does this work?

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,480
The language of life.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,240
Cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,560
Get food in and waste out, grow and build structures,

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,040
escape danger or react to stimuli,

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,640
make copies of themselves, and so on.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,040
All of this is done by speaking the language of life.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,000
And the words of this language are proteins.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,360
This is how this language works in a nutshell.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,480
It all begins with amino acids, tiny organic molecules.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,280
They're the alphabet of the language of life.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,600
There are 21 different ones, like different letters.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,920
Amino acid A, amino acid B, C, and so on.

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,840
If you put around 50 amino acids together, they form a protein,

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,640
which in the language of life is a word.

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,320
And if you put many of these protein words together,

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,280
you get a sentence called a biological pathway.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,840
Let's oversimplify a bit and say, for example,

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,200
your cell needs to break down sugar with the language of life.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,640
It may take the amino acids for the letters B, R, E, A, and K

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,360
to form the protein word break.

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Then combine this word with other protein words

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,960
to form a biological pathway sentence

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
that means break down sugar.

43
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,200
In reality, this language of life is so complex

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
that it defies imagination.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
You need to know about 8,000 words

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,160
to speak a human language really well.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,080
But in the language of life, there are an estimated 20,000.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,920
And while the average English word has five letters,

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,640
human proteins have an average of 375 amino acids.

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,920
The longest protein has more than 30,000.

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
And cells need to execute thousands of steps

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
at any moment.

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,760
If they ever stop speaking the language of life, they die.

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,360
OK, but how do mindless cells speak a language this complex?

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,720
Let's dive a little deeper.

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,560
There are 21 amino acids that can

57
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
be combined to form proteins.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,240
And proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds

59
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,520
to thousands of amino acids.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
For the average protein length of a human cell

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,360
of 375 amino acids, you get a stunning 6.8 times

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
10 to the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make,

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,560
a quadrillion googol, googol, googol, googol times more

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,480
than there are atoms in the universe.

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,000
Most of these possible proteins are useless.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,120
Just like with human language, most random letter combinations

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
are just gibberish.

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
So you need to know which words, which proteins,

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
make up a language to speak it properly.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,280
And this is the job of your DNA, a long sequence

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,360
of instructions.

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,520
If you untangle the cell's DNA, it

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
would be about two meters long.

74
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,520
All of your body's DNA combined into one long string

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,960
would reach to the sun and back over 20 times.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,120
Around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes,

77
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,160
which are basically protein dictionaries that

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,320
contain all the words of the language of life

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
your cells speak.

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,080
But genes are also the building manuals

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,400
for all the proteins your cells need to function.

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,080
The rest of your DNA is probably not useless,

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
but basically like a set of rules.

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
It's like the book of grammar of the language of life.

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Which proteins need to be built at which time?

86
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,320
How many of them do you need?

87
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,600
Which protein words go together and why?

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,680
OK, letters, words, sentences, dictionary, and grammar.

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,360
But of course, this is all just a metaphor for something

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
mind-numbingly complex.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
Let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality.

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,120
How dead proteins make life.

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,240
Now that we have some basic principles,

94
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,000
we have a chance to understand how dead things make life

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
together.

96
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,160
And for that, we need a fundamental force

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,360
of the universe, electromagnetism.

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,080
The elementary particles that make up

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
atoms, which make up amino acids,

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,880
have different charges that attract or repel each other.

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,080
The 21 different amino acids all have slightly different

102
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
charges.

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,120
Some are more negative, others more positive.

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
When your cells build proteins, they

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,560
put different amino acids together in chains,

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
basically long strings.

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Now because of the different charges of the amino acids

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,680
used, these strings begin to fold in on themselves.

109
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,840
This folding process is so complex

110
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,680
that we still haven't completely understood

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
how exactly it works.

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,360
But in a nutshell, 1D strings become 3D structures.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,280
Proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces

114
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,400
with a very specific shape.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,360
In the world of proteins, shape is everything.

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,280
Because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein

117
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
are charged in which way, and this

118
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,080
determines how it can interact with other proteins.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
All of these differently charged puzzle pieces

120
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,320
can snap together or repel each other.

121
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,240
When they snap together, their charge

122
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,280
changes, which can make them change their shape, which then

123
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,840
makes them a new protein, a new tool that can do new things.

124
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,280
This is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful.

125
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,760
You can do basically everything with them.

126
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,920
They can snap together like LEGO pieces

127
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
to build complex structures.

128
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
They can dismantle things.

129
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
They can form complex micro machines

130
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,480
that use energy to do work.

131
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,240
And maybe most stunningly, they can convey information.

132
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell.

133
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,640
There may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin.

134
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,400
If the protein finds that toxin, it changes its shape.

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,520
With that new shape, it can now snap into a different protein

136
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,400
that changes its shape again.

137
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,840
This new protein activates a micro machine

138
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,560
that directly binds to your DNA to order

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,880
the production of a special protein which acts

140
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,120
as an antidote to the toxin.

141
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,640
This cascade of interaction is the pathway

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,760
we spoke about earlier, a sentence

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
in the language of life.

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,280
So without a single active thought,

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,040
proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life.

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,560
In reality, these pathways can have dozens

147
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,760
to hundreds of steps.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,720
How life operates is so incredibly awe inducing.

149
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,640
Somehow, mind numbingly complex interactions

150
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,640
between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less

151
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,000
dead cell.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,640
Somewhere around here, life happens.

153
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,760
But we still don't know what life is.

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,840
How dumb things are smart together.

155
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
We need another analogy.

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So let's talk about ants.

157
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Ants share a fundamental property with cells.

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,520
They are really dumb.

159
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,320
A single ant will just stumble around uselessly.

160
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,160
But if you put a lot of ants together,

161
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,320
they exchange information and do amazing things.

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,600
Constructing complex structures, organizing themselves,

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
caring for broods, or attacking enemies.

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,240
Although dumb individually, together, they

165
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
become something greater.

166
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,480
This phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence.

167
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
It's the observation that entities

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,560
have properties and abilities that their parts do not have.

169
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,160
This is how everything in your body works.

170
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Your cells are bags of proteins guided by chemistry.

171
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,200
But together, these proteins form

172
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,520
a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things.

173
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,240
Cells are mindless robots that are even dumber than ants.

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
But many of them acting together form specialized tissue

175
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,600
and organ systems, from muscles that make your heart beat

176
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,360
to brain cells that make you think.

177
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
If you look outside at the incredible dimension

178
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,400
and scale of space, a place where forever is a real thing,

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,600
it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small.

180
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Not special.

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,920
But if you look inside into what you really are,

182
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,600
you just discover almost indescribable complexity,

183
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,200
the beautiful language of life.

184
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,720
Almost everything in the universe reveals hidden layers of complexity

185
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,440
if you look closer and if you have the knowledge to understand it.

186
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,640
To help you with that, we've created a series

187
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,200
of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level.

188
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
Made in collaboration with our friends at brilliant.org,

189
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
these lessons give you a deeper understanding

190
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,080
of the topics from our most popular videos,

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,400
from rabies and mammalian metabolism to climate science and black holes.

192
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,680
Brilliant is an interactive learning tool

193
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
that makes maths, science, and computer science

194
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
accessible with a hands-on approach.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Because we know that to really learn something, you've got to do it.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,520
Think of each lesson as a one-on-one tutoring version of a Kurzgesagt video.

197
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,560
Brilliant has thousands of other lessons to explore as well,

198
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,640
from maths-based topics like algebra and probability

199
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,360
to the concepts behind algorithms and artificial intelligence.

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,040

You'll learn about DNA instructions, RNA, and protein folding,

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,600
then learn how those concepts are used to tackle modern challenges

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,400
like genome sequencing and human health.
