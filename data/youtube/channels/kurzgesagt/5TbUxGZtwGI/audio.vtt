00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time,

00:07.440 --> 00:14.000
it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So let's start small, with minutes,

00:14.000 --> 00:21.920
hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you

00:21.920 --> 00:28.520
probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months,

00:28.560 --> 00:35.520
and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist

00:35.520 --> 00:40.320
drones, a Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern,

00:40.320 --> 00:46.280
and people on the internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff.

00:46.280 --> 00:53.680
Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st century is 18 years old now.

00:53.680 --> 01:01.200
But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on

01:01.200 --> 01:06.960
9-11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011,

01:06.960 --> 01:13.760
the Syrian Civil War began and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the

01:13.760 --> 01:19.960
20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history and the Cold War. For the

01:19.960 --> 01:24.640
first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, and we almost did,

01:24.640 --> 01:30.360
but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The internet was also invented,

01:30.360 --> 01:35.840
which led to memes, but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this

01:35.840 --> 01:42.600
was a good development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of

01:42.600 --> 01:49.080
recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in

01:49.080 --> 01:55.360
1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.

01:55.360 --> 02:02.040
Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.480
Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time,

02:07.480 --> 02:13.800
we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The

02:13.800 --> 02:19.720
theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his

02:19.720 --> 02:28.280
theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was

02:28.280 --> 02:34.760
very eventful. Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end

02:34.760 --> 02:40.480
of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was

02:40.480 --> 02:48.400
disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years

02:48.400 --> 02:54.480
ago, we set the arbitrary year one of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a

02:54.480 --> 03:02.080
Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So to

03:02.080 --> 03:08.800
a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago that there was still

03:08.880 --> 03:15.600
living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that even. Around 7,000 years

03:15.600 --> 03:22.800
ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.280
We built our first temple and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of

03:29.280 --> 03:36.560
larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens,

03:36.560 --> 03:43.360
the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the cognitive revolution

03:43.360 --> 03:48.800
expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human

03:48.800 --> 03:56.080
species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors

03:56.080 --> 04:02.080
already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And 6 million years

04:02.080 --> 04:09.520
ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human

04:09.520 --> 04:15.600
history. Our close relative Homo erectus survived 10 times longer than we have existed.

04:16.880 --> 04:24.560
This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still,

04:24.560 --> 04:31.280
all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an

04:31.280 --> 04:38.800
enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years,

04:39.600 --> 04:46.000
27 times as long as all humans. That's so long that it means a T-Rex that lived

04:46.000 --> 04:51.360
65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus.

04:52.880 --> 04:59.920
Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet

04:59.920 --> 05:05.840
started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea

05:05.840 --> 05:12.000
creatures. Then came insects, then reptiles. And finally, around 200 million years ago,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.920
mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it

05:17.920 --> 05:24.960
appeared up to 4.1 billion years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only

05:25.040 --> 05:31.920
of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic

05:31.920 --> 05:38.400
imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years,

05:38.400 --> 05:43.040
frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.120
But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.

05:47.120 --> 05:56.320
13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later,

05:56.320 --> 06:04.080
our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is,

06:04.080 --> 06:09.120
we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it, the past.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.200
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years,

06:15.200 --> 06:20.560
the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4

06:20.560 --> 06:26.480
billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to

06:26.480 --> 06:34.400
survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100

06:34.400 --> 06:40.160
billion years, most of the bigger stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer,

06:40.160 --> 06:46.320
illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out,

06:46.320 --> 06:53.520
and one day, the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark. And at some

06:53.520 --> 06:59.680
point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do, our universe will reach its final

06:59.680 --> 07:08.640
stage, heat death. Nothing changes anymore, the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling

07:08.640 --> 07:15.120
some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are too. It's only natural. The good news is,

07:15.120 --> 07:23.040
this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy

07:23.040 --> 07:37.040
you like, ask them out. Time is precious. Make it count. One of the questions we get asked the most

07:37.040 --> 07:42.320
is how we make animated videos. The short answer is with Adobe After Effects and Years of Training.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.680
But if you'd like to get a glimpse, we now have something for you.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.520
We made Skillshare tutorials explaining in detail how we animate scenes from our videos.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.960
If you aren't already familiar with it, Skillshare is an online learning community with more than

07:56.960 --> 08:03.040
18,000 classes in things like writing, animation, and video editing. Their premium membership gives

08:03.040 --> 08:07.440
you unlimited access to high quality classes from professionals working in their fields,

08:07.440 --> 08:12.320
so you can improve your skills, unlock new opportunities, and do work that you really enjoy.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.520
It's also extremely affordable. The annual subscription is less than $10 a month.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.320
The first 1,000 people to sign up get their first two months for only 99 cents.

08:22.880 --> 08:29.040
So if you want to learn new things and support Kurzgesagt, give it a try. How did you like this

08:29.040 --> 08:33.840
remake? We're thinking about redoing a few of our older videos in the next one or two years.

08:34.560 --> 08:41.920
Any videos you would like to see redone?
