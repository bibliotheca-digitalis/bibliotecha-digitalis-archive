1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,000
it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So let's start small, with minutes,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,920
hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,520
probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months,

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,520
and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
drones, a Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern,

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,280
and people on the internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,680
Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st century is 18 years old now.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,200
But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,960
9-11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011,

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,760
the Syrian Civil War began and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,960
20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history and the Cold War. For the

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,640
first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, and we almost did,

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,360
but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The internet was also invented,

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,840
which led to memes, but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,600
was a good development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,080
recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in

18
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,360
1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine.

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time,

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,800
we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,720
theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:28,280
theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,760
very eventful. Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end

25
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,480
of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,400
disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,480
ago, we set the arbitrary year one of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,080
Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So to

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,800
a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago that there was still

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,600
living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that even. Around 7,000 years

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,800
ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded.

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
We built our first temple and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,560
larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens,

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,360
the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the cognitive revolution

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,800
expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human

36
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,080
species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080
already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And 6 million years

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,520
ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human

39
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,600
history. Our close relative Homo erectus survived 10 times longer than we have existed.

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,560
This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still,

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,280
all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,800
enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years,

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,000
27 times as long as all humans. That's so long that it means a T-Rex that lived

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,360
65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus.

45
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,920
Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet

46
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,840
started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea

47
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,000
creatures. Then came insects, then reptiles. And finally, around 200 million years ago,

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,920
mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it

49
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,960
appeared up to 4.1 billion years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,920
of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic

51
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,400
imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years,

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,040
frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans.

53
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,120
But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,320
13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later,

55
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:04,080
our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is,

56
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it, the past.

57
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years,

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,560
the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4

59
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,480
billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to

60
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:34,400
survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100

61
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,160
billion years, most of the bigger stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer,

62
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,320
illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out,

63
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,520
and one day, the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark. And at some

64
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,680
point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do, our universe will reach its final

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:08,640
stage, heat death. Nothing changes anymore, the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,120
some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are too. It's only natural. The good news is,

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,040
this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:37,040
you like, ask them out. Time is precious. Make it count. One of the questions we get asked the most

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,320
is how we make animated videos. The short answer is with Adobe After Effects and Years of Training.

70
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,680
But if you'd like to get a glimpse, we now have something for you.

71
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,520
We made Skillshare tutorials explaining in detail how we animate scenes from our videos.

72
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
If you aren't already familiar with it, Skillshare is an online learning community with more than

73
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,040
18,000 classes in things like writing, animation, and video editing. Their premium membership gives

74
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,440
you unlimited access to high quality classes from professionals working in their fields,

75
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,320
so you can improve your skills, unlock new opportunities, and do work that you really enjoy.

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,520
It's also extremely affordable. The annual subscription is less than $10 a month.

77
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,320
The first 1,000 people to sign up get their first two months for only 99 cents.

78
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,040
So if you want to learn new things and support Kurzgesagt, give it a try. How did you like this

79
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,840
remake? We're thinking about redoing a few of our older videos in the next one or two years.

80
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,920
Any videos you would like to see redone?
