0	7440	Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time,
7440	14000	it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So let's start small, with minutes,
14000	21920	hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you
21920	28520	probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months,
28560	35520	and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist
35520	40320	drones, a Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern,
40320	46280	and people on the internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff.
46280	53680	Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st century is 18 years old now.
53680	61200	But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on
61200	66960	9-11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011,
66960	73760	the Syrian Civil War began and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the
73760	79960	20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history and the Cold War. For the
79960	84640	first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, and we almost did,
84640	90360	but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The internet was also invented,
90360	95840	which led to memes, but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this
95840	102600	was a good development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of
102600	109080	recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in
109080	115360	1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day.
115360	122040	Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine.
122040	127480	Farmers became workers and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time,
127480	133800	we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The
133800	139720	theory of evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his
139720	148280	theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was
148280	154760	very eventful. Columbus's discovery of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end
154760	160480	of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was
160480	168400	disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years
168400	174480	ago, we set the arbitrary year one of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a
174480	182080	Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So to
182080	188800	a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago that there was still
188880	195600	living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that even. Around 7,000 years
195600	202800	ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded.
203440	209280	We built our first temple and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of
209280	216560	larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens,
216560	223360	the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the cognitive revolution
223360	228800	expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human
228800	236080	species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors
236080	242080	already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And 6 million years
242080	249520	ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human
249520	255600	history. Our close relative Homo erectus survived 10 times longer than we have existed.
256880	264560	This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still,
264560	271280	all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an
271280	278800	enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years,
279600	286000	27 times as long as all humans. That's so long that it means a T-Rex that lived
286000	291360	65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus.
292880	299920	Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet
299920	305840	started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea
305840	312000	creatures. Then came insects, then reptiles. And finally, around 200 million years ago,
312000	317920	mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it
317920	324960	appeared up to 4.1 billion years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only
325040	331920	of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic
331920	338400	imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years,
338400	343040	frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans.
343040	347120	But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new.
347120	356320	13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later,
356320	364080	our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is,
364080	369120	we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it, the past.
370480	375200	Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years,
375200	380560	the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4
380560	386480	billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to
386480	394400	survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100
394400	400160	billion years, most of the bigger stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer,
400160	406320	illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out,
406320	413520	and one day, the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark. And at some
413520	419680	point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do, our universe will reach its final
419680	428640	stage, heat death. Nothing changes anymore, the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling
428640	435120	some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are too. It's only natural. The good news is,
435120	443040	this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy
443040	457040	you like, ask them out. Time is precious. Make it count. One of the questions we get asked the most
457040	462320	is how we make animated videos. The short answer is with Adobe After Effects and Years of Training.
462960	465680	But if you'd like to get a glimpse, we now have something for you.
466720	471520	We made Skillshare tutorials explaining in detail how we animate scenes from our videos.
472800	476960	If you aren't already familiar with it, Skillshare is an online learning community with more than
476960	483040	18,000 classes in things like writing, animation, and video editing. Their premium membership gives
483040	487440	you unlimited access to high quality classes from professionals working in their fields,
487440	492320	so you can improve your skills, unlock new opportunities, and do work that you really enjoy.
493360	497520	It's also extremely affordable. The annual subscription is less than $10 a month.
498480	502320	The first 1,000 people to sign up get their first two months for only 99 cents.
502880	509040	So if you want to learn new things and support Kurzgesagt, give it a try. How did you like this
509040	513840	remake? We're thinking about redoing a few of our older videos in the next one or two years.
514560	521920	Any videos you would like to see redone?
