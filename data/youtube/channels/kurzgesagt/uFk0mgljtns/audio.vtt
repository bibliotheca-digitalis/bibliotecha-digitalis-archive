00:00.000 --> 00:09.180
For years, people have asked how we make our videos, so let's finally talk about it.

00:09.180 --> 00:20.660
How to make a Kurzgesagt video in 1200 hours or more.

00:20.660 --> 00:23.620
First things first, we need a topic.

00:23.620 --> 00:28.740
Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows

00:28.740 --> 00:29.740
longer.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.340
Also, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time.

00:33.340 --> 00:38.620
This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.320
The variety is half the fun.

00:41.320 --> 00:46.420
We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics

00:46.420 --> 00:48.880
fascinating and beautiful.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.700
But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to

00:53.700 --> 00:56.220
time.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.580
Laying the foundation, script.

00:59.620 --> 01:04.120
Research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts

01:04.120 --> 01:06.500
who point us in the right direction.

01:06.500 --> 01:11.100
We want to have a fact-based worldview, and our videos are trying to reflect that.

01:11.100 --> 01:15.620
So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it.

01:15.620 --> 01:19.460
Usually after a few weeks of researching, we start writing.

01:19.460 --> 01:25.660
A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again.

01:25.660 --> 01:32.120
To make sure we don't misrepresent something, we ask experts to fact-check and correct us.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.180
Writing is the bottleneck for our videos and very hard to speed up.

01:36.180 --> 01:42.780
Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.100
Let's visualize illustration.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.180
When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video.

01:49.180 --> 01:53.980
We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need

01:53.980 --> 01:55.620
the most attention.

01:55.620 --> 02:00.500
On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.740
Although we have built up an illustration library, we still do most illustrations from

02:04.740 --> 02:08.780
scratch to give our videos a more unique look.

02:08.780 --> 02:13.540
The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly

02:13.540 --> 02:17.740
as possible while also having interesting things to look at.

02:17.740 --> 02:22.260
Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs.

02:22.260 --> 02:28.560
In total, 2-3 illustrators spend 8-12 weeks illustrating the video.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.500
Now it's my turn.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.080
Narration.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.540
When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on

02:36.540 --> 02:40.460
a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.180
It's important to keep the flow, so I try to get one version done and then go back through,

02:45.180 --> 02:51.300
retaking paragraphs and sentences until they feel right and a full version is ready.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.340
It's alive.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.220
Animation.

02:55.220 --> 02:58.340
Now the scenes and audio need to be animated.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.580
We make things move in Adobe After Effects, and recently we've begun experimenting with

03:02.580 --> 03:04.540
Cinema 4D.

03:04.540 --> 03:09.040
The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.780
The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects.

03:13.780 --> 03:19.380
Each character is rigged so we can move them more naturally.

03:19.380 --> 03:24.060
Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on

03:24.060 --> 03:26.820
screen has been moved manually.

03:26.820 --> 03:33.500
So 2-3 animators animate scene after scene for about 8-10 weeks in total.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.980
Ending on a high note, music and sound design.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.760
The final step is the music.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.700
Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere

03:45.700 --> 03:48.500
and to highlight the important parts.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.060
You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.740
The icing on the cake are the sound effects.

03:56.740 --> 04:01.140
Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an

04:01.140 --> 04:03.140
additional layer.

04:03.140 --> 04:07.860
So try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it.

04:07.860 --> 04:12.340
All of these steps happen in parallel since we usually work on 2-4 videos at the same

04:12.340 --> 04:15.300
time in various stages.

04:15.300 --> 04:18.900
What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.420
Every few days we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just

04:23.420 --> 04:24.820
right.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.860
And that's it.

04:25.860 --> 04:30.700
At least 1200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video.

04:30.700 --> 04:34.780
As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team and then putting them

04:34.780 --> 04:38.420
on the internet for free is a weird business model.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.180
Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat.

04:42.180 --> 04:46.140
Commercial work for NGOs, start-ups or corporations.

04:46.140 --> 04:49.880
Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.220
We struck a deal with Funk from German Public Broadcasting to revive the German channel

04:54.220 --> 04:57.300
and with Wix to start a Spanish channel.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.460
But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you.

05:01.460 --> 05:07.740
Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support, merchandise

05:07.740 --> 05:10.000
and Patreon.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.800
So if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos, you can directly

05:13.800 --> 05:19.320
support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store or by becoming a Patreon and

05:19.320 --> 05:20.960
joining the bird army.

05:20.960 --> 05:26.840
Don't feel obligated though, watching, engaging or sharing our videos is already helping us

05:26.840 --> 05:28.240
a lot.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.880
But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much, you're making our videos free

05:32.880 --> 05:34.600
for everyone.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.660
You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious

05:39.660 --> 05:43.180
projects that would be too scary or too big otherwise.

05:43.180 --> 05:48.660
Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind, it began as a personal project because

05:48.660 --> 05:52.060
it felt good to make something with time and love.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.480
And this is still true today.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.700
Making these videos is our goal, doing the work every day and getting better.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.640
To make science beautiful and interesting.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.980
Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years and from our first subscriber

06:07.980 --> 06:09.880
to the ten millionth.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.460
This journey has been so wild and so much fun.

06:13.460 --> 06:18.700
And we can't wait to share the stuff we're working on right now with you, in a year or

06:18.700 --> 06:21.740
maybe two.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.980
We want to make meta videos like this from time to time now.

06:24.980 --> 06:29.860
If you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer, you can do so on Reddit, link

06:29.860 --> 06:30.540
in the description.

06:37.980 --> 06:44.460
Thank you.
