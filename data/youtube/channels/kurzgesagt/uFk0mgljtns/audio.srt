1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,180
For years, people have asked how we make our videos, so let's finally talk about it.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:20,660
How to make a Kurzgesagt video in 1200 hours or more.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,620
First things first, we need a topic.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,740
Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,740
longer.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,340
Also, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,620
This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,320
The variety is half the fun.

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,420
We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,880
fascinating and beautiful.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,700
But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,220
time.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,580
Laying the foundation, script.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,120
Research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,500
who point us in the right direction.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,100
We want to have a fact-based worldview, and our videos are trying to reflect that.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,620
So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,460
Usually after a few weeks of researching, we start writing.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,660
A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again.

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:32,120
To make sure we don't misrepresent something, we ask experts to fact-check and correct us.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,180
Writing is the bottleneck for our videos and very hard to speed up.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,780
Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete.

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,100
Let's visualize illustration.

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,180
When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,980
We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,620
the most attention.

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,500
On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,740
Although we have built up an illustration library, we still do most illustrations from

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,780
scratch to give our videos a more unique look.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,540
The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,740
as possible while also having interesting things to look at.

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,260
Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs.

33
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,560
In total, 2-3 illustrators spend 8-12 weeks illustrating the video.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,500
Now it's my turn.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,080
Narration.

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,540
When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,460
a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,180
It's important to keep the flow, so I try to get one version done and then go back through,

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,300
retaking paragraphs and sentences until they feel right and a full version is ready.

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
It's alive.

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,220
Animation.

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,340
Now the scenes and audio need to be animated.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,580
We make things move in Adobe After Effects, and recently we've begun experimenting with

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,540
Cinema 4D.

45
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,040
The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,780
The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects.

47
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,380
Each character is rigged so we can move them more naturally.

48
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,060
Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,820
screen has been moved manually.

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,500
So 2-3 animators animate scene after scene for about 8-10 weeks in total.

51
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,980
Ending on a high note, music and sound design.

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,760
The final step is the music.

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,700
Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,500
and to highlight the important parts.

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,060
You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify.

56
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,740
The icing on the cake are the sound effects.

57
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,140
Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,140
additional layer.

59
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,860
So try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,340
All of these steps happen in parallel since we usually work on 2-4 videos at the same

61
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,300
time in various stages.

62
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,900
What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits.

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,420
Every few days we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just

64
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,820
right.

65
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,860
And that's it.

66
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,700
At least 1200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video.

67
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,780
As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team and then putting them

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,420
on the internet for free is a weird business model.

69
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,180
Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat.

70
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,140
Commercial work for NGOs, start-ups or corporations.

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,880
Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,220
We struck a deal with Funk from German Public Broadcasting to revive the German channel

73
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,300
and with Wix to start a Spanish channel.

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,460
But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you.

75
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,740
Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support, merchandise

76
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,000
and Patreon.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,800
So if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos, you can directly

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,320
support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store or by becoming a Patreon and

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
joining the bird army.

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,840
Don't feel obligated though, watching, engaging or sharing our videos is already helping us

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,240
a lot.

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,880
But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much, you're making our videos free

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
for everyone.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,660
You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious

85
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,180
projects that would be too scary or too big otherwise.

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,660
Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind, it began as a personal project because

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,060
it felt good to make something with time and love.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,480
And this is still true today.

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,700
Making these videos is our goal, doing the work every day and getting better.

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,640
To make science beautiful and interesting.

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,980
Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years and from our first subscriber

92
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,880
to the ten millionth.

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,460
This journey has been so wild and so much fun.

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,700
And we can't wait to share the stuff we're working on right now with you, in a year or

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,740
maybe two.

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,980
We want to make meta videos like this from time to time now.

97
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,860
If you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer, you can do so on Reddit, link

98
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,540
in the description.

99
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:44,460
Thank you.
