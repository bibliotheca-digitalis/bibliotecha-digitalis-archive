0	9180	For years, people have asked how we make our videos, so let's finally talk about it.
9180	20660	How to make a Kurzgesagt video in 1200 hours or more.
20660	23620	First things first, we need a topic.
23620	28740	Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows
28740	29740	longer.
29740	33340	Also, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time.
33340	38620	This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid.
38620	41320	The variety is half the fun.
41320	46420	We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics
46420	48880	fascinating and beautiful.
48880	53700	But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to
53700	56220	time.
56220	59580	Laying the foundation, script.
59620	64120	Research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts
64120	66500	who point us in the right direction.
66500	71100	We want to have a fact-based worldview, and our videos are trying to reflect that.
71100	75620	So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it.
75620	79460	Usually after a few weeks of researching, we start writing.
79460	85660	A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again.
85660	92120	To make sure we don't misrepresent something, we ask experts to fact-check and correct us.
92120	96180	Writing is the bottleneck for our videos and very hard to speed up.
96180	102780	Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete.
102780	106100	Let's visualize illustration.
106100	109180	When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video.
109180	113980	We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need
113980	115620	the most attention.
115620	120500	On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator.
120500	124740	Although we have built up an illustration library, we still do most illustrations from
124740	128780	scratch to give our videos a more unique look.
128780	133540	The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly
133540	137740	as possible while also having interesting things to look at.
137740	142260	Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs.
142260	148560	In total, 2-3 illustrators spend 8-12 weeks illustrating the video.
148560	150500	Now it's my turn.
150500	152080	Narration.
152080	156540	When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on
156540	160460	a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools.
160460	165180	It's important to keep the flow, so I try to get one version done and then go back through,
165180	171300	retaking paragraphs and sentences until they feel right and a full version is ready.
171340	172340	It's alive.
172340	175220	Animation.
175220	178340	Now the scenes and audio need to be animated.
178340	182580	We make things move in Adobe After Effects, and recently we've begun experimenting with
182580	184540	Cinema 4D.
184540	189040	The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them.
189040	193780	The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects.
193780	199380	Each character is rigged so we can move them more naturally.
199380	204060	Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on
204060	206820	screen has been moved manually.
206820	213500	So 2-3 animators animate scene after scene for about 8-10 weeks in total.
213500	217980	Ending on a high note, music and sound design.
217980	220760	The final step is the music.
220760	225700	Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere
225700	228500	and to highlight the important parts.
228500	233060	You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify.
233060	236740	The icing on the cake are the sound effects.
236740	241140	Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an
241140	243140	additional layer.
243140	247860	So try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it.
247860	252340	All of these steps happen in parallel since we usually work on 2-4 videos at the same
252340	255300	time in various stages.
255300	258900	What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits.
258900	263420	Every few days we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just
263420	264820	right.
264820	265860	And that's it.
265860	270700	At least 1200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video.
270700	274780	As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team and then putting them
274780	278420	on the internet for free is a weird business model.
278420	282180	Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat.
282180	286140	Commercial work for NGOs, start-ups or corporations.
286140	289880	Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations.
289880	294220	We struck a deal with Funk from German Public Broadcasting to revive the German channel
294220	297300	and with Wix to start a Spanish channel.
297300	301460	But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you.
301460	307740	Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support, merchandise
307740	310000	and Patreon.
310000	313800	So if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos, you can directly
313800	319320	support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store or by becoming a Patreon and
319320	320960	joining the bird army.
320960	326840	Don't feel obligated though, watching, engaging or sharing our videos is already helping us
326840	328240	a lot.
328240	332880	But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much, you're making our videos free
332880	334600	for everyone.
334600	339660	You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious
339660	343180	projects that would be too scary or too big otherwise.
343180	348660	Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind, it began as a personal project because
348660	352060	it felt good to make something with time and love.
352060	354480	And this is still true today.
354480	359700	Making these videos is our goal, doing the work every day and getting better.
359700	363640	To make science beautiful and interesting.
363640	367980	Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years and from our first subscriber
367980	369880	to the ten millionth.
369880	373460	This journey has been so wild and so much fun.
373460	378700	And we can't wait to share the stuff we're working on right now with you, in a year or
378700	381740	maybe two.
381740	384980	We want to make meta videos like this from time to time now.
384980	389860	If you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer, you can do so on Reddit, link
389860	390540	in the description.
397980	404460	Thank you.
