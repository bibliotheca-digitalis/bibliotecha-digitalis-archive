0	5480	You're not a person. You're a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells.
6600	13340	There is so much of you that if your cells were human-sized, you'd be as big as 20 Mount Everest's.
13980	17880	For your creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an
18360	24560	ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space. A perfect place to move into and have a family.
25360	29200	While some of these guests are welcome, most are not.
30000	37720	Your immune system is the guardian of this planet, the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion.
38840	43400	Unfortunately, your enemies in the tiny world have a huge advantage.
52520	56960	Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells.
57400	64100	First, you need to find someone who thinks you're cute, date and be awkward, and if things work out in a
64520	67340	complicated dance, two of your cells merge together.
68080	75280	Then, you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it's released into the world as a human being.
75800	81320	And even then, you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful.
82320	87920	A bacterium consists of one cell. It can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour.
88440	92700	A virus can turn into hundreds within hours and billions within days.
93520	97480	Your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you.
97920	103640	Even worse, for a bacterium or virus, your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure.
104400	107400	Because they go through so many generations so quickly,
107920	109440	eventually, by pure chance,
109440	115860	there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then
116120	118600	multiply quickly again. In other words,
118600	125100	you're facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you're too slow to keep up with their evolution.
125560	127560	This is bad.
127600	131880	Luckily, your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever.
132400	137440	The second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and
137800	141600	so sophisticated that we still haven't discovered all its secrets.
142000	143680	Since it's so complicated,
143680	148640	we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time. If you want the full story,
149000	151360	wait for the announcement at the end of the video.
152000	157320	Okay, so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus? In a nutshell,
157400	162840	you actually have two immune systems, the innate and the adaptive immune system.
163440	169360	The innate immune system was ready when you were born. It mostly consists of general-purpose soldiers.
169360	171900	We introduced them in the last immune video.
172520	179780	The adaptive immune system carries two types of cells, T-cells and B-cells, that are your super weapons and are
180080	182500	incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies.
183220	190060	These cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy, but once they're ready, they pack a real punch.
190900	197300	What makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe.
197580	199580	It has an answer to everything.
199860	207180	You have at least one of these super weapon cells inside you to fight the Black Death, the coronavirus and the first deadly
207340	210660	bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years.
211220	217160	This makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly.
217800	219580	How is this possible?
219580	223460	To understand what's going on here, we need to take one step back.
224020	228940	All organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts, mostly proteins.
229780	236660	Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes. You can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces.
237420	242180	There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies.
242780	248900	Why is this important? Because proteins are, in a way, the language of the micro world.
249460	251460	Cells don't have eyes or ears,
251500	258460	so to tell friend from foe, they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy.
259740	266640	Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.
267060	274480	So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces.
274800	277420	When a cell connects together with a protein and
278180	281600	recognizes it as enemy, it knows that it has to attack.
282420	289000	Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader.
289580	296340	But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces, this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces.
297020	302000	This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year. The
302380	307960	influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.
308620	315300	The soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized.
315380	317840	That's why they are your all-purpose weapons.
318300	325100	But they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop.
325540	332180	So the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and
332420	338120	10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces, which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy.
338540	340380	But how is this possible?
340380	347020	How could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece?
347820	352020	Well, the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat code,
352460	357220	mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors.
357600	360260	The details are way too complicated for this video,
360260	362940	but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have
363020	369900	official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different
370180	376940	receptors. A good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own
376940	378260	special recipe.
378260	386260	They have 100 different ingredients to choose from. Each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor.
387060	391620	So each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together.
392020	395880	Maybe tomato, chicken, rice, and half an onion as entree,
396380	403540	marshmallow, pepper, strawberries, and a quarter banana as a dessert. Or cucumber, beef, potatoes, and two carrots, and
403900	406300	blueberries, chocolate, and cream with a pinch of cinnamon.
407300	413540	Even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients, there are billions of possible recipes.
414540	419820	And likewise, with just a small selection of gene fragments, your cells create billions of receptors.
420300	426180	The details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book.
426420	431980	In any case, by mixing up gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations.
432580	440580	So in the end, you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor, the dish from our metaphor,
440580	444220	that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece.
444780	449500	In total, you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist.
450100	453060	But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem.
453060	458940	If your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe,
459100	462260	wouldn't it also make some that can attack your own cells?
462940	464940	Yes, it happens all the time.
465420	472060	This is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this.
472700	475380	The murder university of your thymus.
475860	481100	Your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart, and you've probably never heard of it.
481740	486380	Interestingly, your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age,
486620	489780	because it's in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty.
490420	492420	But what does the thymus do?
492860	500220	In your murder university, your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum.
501300	507100	Basically, it's showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react.
507820	514260	When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it, the teacher cells order them to kill themselves,
514380	516900	and they are eaten up and recycled.
517780	521660	The immune system is so particular about this process that around
522420	526860	98% of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder university die there.
527780	531900	2% graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real.
532540	539420	If this process goes wrong and the cells escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces, this can lead to auto-immune disease,
539780	543300	where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside.
543700	546500	And this, again, is another story for another time.
547380	549380	Okay, let's summarize.
549820	557220	Your immune system has two parts, one that defends you right after birth, and one that carries the largest library of super weapons in the universe,
557580	559580	but needs to boot up first.
559740	566400	To create billions of different super weapons, your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a
566780	568780	breathtaking variety of attack weapons.
569020	575020	Then they enter a murder university that only 2% survive to make sure they don't attack you, and
575300	581940	then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe.
583060	587220	Now, wait a second. If this is all true, why do we get sick at all?
588140	595380	Why was a new disease like COVID-19 able to kill millions of people? And how do vaccines boost the mechanisms
595380	600020	we explained in this video to supercharge your immune system and defend you from the worst
600220	604460	diseases humanity has ever encountered, from smallpox to COVID-19?
605260	612900	Well, everything we've just learned about is a tiny, tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day
613020	617140	inside your body, and there are so many amazing details and questions here.
617460	621300	How does your body actually find the right cell in time to protect you?
621660	629420	How do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway? And what about all the things that didn't fit in this video?
630580	637300	Well, today finally marks the release of Immune, a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive,
637740	641460	written by Philip Detmer, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.
641820	647980	First, we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble, and then because so many of you pre-ordered that we didn't have enough
648020	651940	copies for the original launch day. Thank you so, so much for that.
652780	658700	Immune tells the epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body, how you
658940	660940	experience being sick and healthy.
660940	664740	The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kurzgesagt videos,
664820	671020	but is able to dive way deeper into its subjects, so go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself.
671540	676460	Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders and cells, learn how your immune system
676780	680740	actually works and protects you from cuts, cancer, and COVID.
681300	685700	Never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity works.
686420	690260	Immune is fun and great to look at, and it even smells good.
690900	693060	Follow the link in the description to order it today.
693660	700180	This is the end of a decade-long personal journey working on this, so thank you all so, so much for your support, and
700620	702900	thank you for watching and reading.
706460	708460	you
