1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
You're not a person. You're a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,340
There is so much of you that if your cells were human-sized, you'd be as big as 20 Mount Everest's.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,880
For your creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,560
ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space. A perfect place to move into and have a family.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,200
While some of these guests are welcome, most are not.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,720
Your immune system is the guardian of this planet, the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Unfortunately, your enemies in the tiny world have a huge advantage.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,960
Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells.

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,100
First, you need to find someone who thinks you're cute, date and be awkward, and if things work out in a

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,340
complicated dance, two of your cells merge together.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,280
Then, you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it's released into the world as a human being.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,320
And even then, you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
A bacterium consists of one cell. It can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,700
A virus can turn into hundreds within hours and billions within days.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you.

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,640
Even worse, for a bacterium or virus, your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure.

17
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Because they go through so many generations so quickly,

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
eventually, by pure chance,

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,860
there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,600
multiply quickly again. In other words,

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,100
you're facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you're too slow to keep up with their evolution.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,560
This is bad.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,880
Luckily, your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440
The second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,600
so sophisticated that we still haven't discovered all its secrets.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Since it's so complicated,

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,640
we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time. If you want the full story,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,360
wait for the announcement at the end of the video.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,320
Okay, so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus? In a nutshell,

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,840
you actually have two immune systems, the innate and the adaptive immune system.

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,360
The innate immune system was ready when you were born. It mostly consists of general-purpose soldiers.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,900
We introduced them in the last immune video.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,780
The adaptive immune system carries two types of cells, T-cells and B-cells, that are your super weapons and are

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,500
incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies.

35
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,060
These cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy, but once they're ready, they pack a real punch.

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,300
What makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe.

37
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,580
It has an answer to everything.

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,180
You have at least one of these super weapon cells inside you to fight the Black Death, the coronavirus and the first deadly

39
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,660
bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years.

40
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,160
This makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly.

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,580
How is this possible?

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,460
To understand what's going on here, we need to take one step back.

43
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,940
All organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts, mostly proteins.

44
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:56,660
Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes. You can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces.

45
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,180
There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies.

46
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,900
Why is this important? Because proteins are, in a way, the language of the micro world.

47
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Cells don't have eyes or ears,

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,460
so to tell friend from foe, they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy.

49
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:26,640
Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.

50
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,480
So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,420
When a cell connects together with a protein and

52
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,600
recognizes it as enemy, it knows that it has to attack.

53
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,000
Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader.

54
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,340
But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces, this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces.

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,000
This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year. The

56
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,960
influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,300
The soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized.

58
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,840
That's why they are your all-purpose weapons.

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,100
But they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop.

60
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:32,180
So the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,120
10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces, which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy.

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,380
But how is this possible?

63
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,020
How could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece?

64
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,020
Well, the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat code,

65
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,220
mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,260
The details are way too complicated for this video,

67
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,940
but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have

68
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,900
official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different

69
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,940
receptors. A good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own

70
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,260
special recipe.

71
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:26,260
They have 100 different ingredients to choose from. Each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor.

72
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,620
So each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together.

73
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,880
Maybe tomato, chicken, rice, and half an onion as entree,

74
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:43,540
marshmallow, pepper, strawberries, and a quarter banana as a dessert. Or cucumber, beef, potatoes, and two carrots, and

75
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,300
blueberries, chocolate, and cream with a pinch of cinnamon.

76
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,540
Even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients, there are billions of possible recipes.

77
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,820
And likewise, with just a small selection of gene fragments, your cells create billions of receptors.

78
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,180
The details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book.

79
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,980
In any case, by mixing up gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations.

80
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:20,580
So in the end, you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor, the dish from our metaphor,

81
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,220
that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece.

82
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,500
In total, you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist.

83
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,060
But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem.

84
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,940
If your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe,

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,260
wouldn't it also make some that can attack your own cells?

86
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
Yes, it happens all the time.

87
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,060
This is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this.

88
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,380
The murder university of your thymus.

89
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,100
Your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart, and you've probably never heard of it.

90
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,380
Interestingly, your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age,

91
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,780
because it's in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty.

92
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
But what does the thymus do?

93
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,220
In your murder university, your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum.

94
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,100
Basically, it's showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react.

95
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,260
When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it, the teacher cells order them to kill themselves,

96
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,900
and they are eaten up and recycled.

97
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,660
The immune system is so particular about this process that around

98
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,860
98% of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder university die there.

99
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,900
2% graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real.

100
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,420
If this process goes wrong and the cells escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces, this can lead to auto-immune disease,

101
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,300
where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside.

102
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,500
And this, again, is another story for another time.

103
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,380
Okay, let's summarize.

104
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,220
Your immune system has two parts, one that defends you right after birth, and one that carries the largest library of super weapons in the universe,

105
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
but needs to boot up first.

106
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:26,400
To create billions of different super weapons, your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a

107
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
breathtaking variety of attack weapons.

108
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Then they enter a murder university that only 2% survive to make sure they don't attack you, and

109
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,940
then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe.

110
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,220
Now, wait a second. If this is all true, why do we get sick at all?

111
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:55,380
Why was a new disease like COVID-19 able to kill millions of people? And how do vaccines boost the mechanisms

112
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,020
we explained in this video to supercharge your immune system and defend you from the worst

113
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,460
diseases humanity has ever encountered, from smallpox to COVID-19?

114
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:12,900
Well, everything we've just learned about is a tiny, tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day

115
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,140
inside your body, and there are so many amazing details and questions here.

116
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,300
How does your body actually find the right cell in time to protect you?

117
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:29,420
How do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway? And what about all the things that didn't fit in this video?

118
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:37,300
Well, today finally marks the release of Immune, a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive,

119
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,460
written by Philip Detmer, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.

120
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,980
First, we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble, and then because so many of you pre-ordered that we didn't have enough

121
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,940
copies for the original launch day. Thank you so, so much for that.

122
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,700
Immune tells the epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body, how you

123
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
experience being sick and healthy.

124
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,740
The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kurzgesagt videos,

125
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,020
but is able to dive way deeper into its subjects, so go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself.

126
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,460
Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders and cells, learn how your immune system

127
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,740
actually works and protects you from cuts, cancer, and COVID.

128
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,700
Never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity works.

129
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,260
Immune is fun and great to look at, and it even smells good.

130
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,060
Follow the link in the description to order it today.

131
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,180
This is the end of a decade-long personal journey working on this, so thank you all so, so much for your support, and

132
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,900
thank you for watching and reading.

133
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,460
you
