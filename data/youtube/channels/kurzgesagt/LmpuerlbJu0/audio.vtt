00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
You're not a person. You're a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells.

00:06.600 --> 00:13.340
There is so much of you that if your cells were human-sized, you'd be as big as 20 Mount Everest's.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.880
For your creepy-crawly inhabitants, this makes your body an

00:18.360 --> 00:24.560
ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space. A perfect place to move into and have a family.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.200
While some of these guests are welcome, most are not.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.720
Your immune system is the guardian of this planet, the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.400
Unfortunately, your enemies in the tiny world have a huge advantage.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.960
Consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells.

00:57.400 --> 01:04.100
First, you need to find someone who thinks you're cute, date and be awkward, and if things work out in a

01:04.520 --> 01:07.340
complicated dance, two of your cells merge together.

01:08.080 --> 01:15.280
Then, you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it's released into the world as a human being.

01:15.800 --> 01:21.320
And even then, you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.920
A bacterium consists of one cell. It can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.700
A virus can turn into hundreds within hours and billions within days.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.480
Your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.640
Even worse, for a bacterium or virus, your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.400
Because they go through so many generations so quickly,

01:47.920 --> 01:49.440
eventually, by pure chance,

01:49.440 --> 01:55.860
there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then

01:56.120 --> 01:58.600
multiply quickly again. In other words,

01:58.600 --> 02:05.100
you're facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you're too slow to keep up with their evolution.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.560
This is bad.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.880
Luckily, your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.440
The second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and

02:17.800 --> 02:21.600
so sophisticated that we still haven't discovered all its secrets.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.680
Since it's so complicated,

02:23.680 --> 02:28.640
we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time. If you want the full story,

02:29.000 --> 02:31.360
wait for the announcement at the end of the video.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.320
Okay, so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus? In a nutshell,

02:37.400 --> 02:42.840
you actually have two immune systems, the innate and the adaptive immune system.

02:43.440 --> 02:49.360
The innate immune system was ready when you were born. It mostly consists of general-purpose soldiers.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.900
We introduced them in the last immune video.

02:52.520 --> 02:59.780
The adaptive immune system carries two types of cells, T-cells and B-cells, that are your super weapons and are

03:00.080 --> 03:02.500
incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies.

03:03.220 --> 03:10.060
These cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy, but once they're ready, they pack a real punch.

03:10.900 --> 03:17.300
What makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.580
It has an answer to everything.

03:19.860 --> 03:27.180
You have at least one of these super weapon cells inside you to fight the Black Death, the coronavirus and the first deadly

03:27.340 --> 03:30.660
bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years.

03:31.220 --> 03:37.160
This makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.580
How is this possible?

03:39.580 --> 03:43.460
To understand what's going on here, we need to take one step back.

03:44.020 --> 03:48.940
All organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts, mostly proteins.

03:49.780 --> 03:56.660
Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes. You can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.180
There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies.

04:02.780 --> 04:08.900
Why is this important? Because proteins are, in a way, the language of the micro world.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.460
Cells don't have eyes or ears,

04:11.500 --> 04:18.460
so to tell friend from foe, they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy.

04:19.740 --> 04:26.640
Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece.

04:27.060 --> 04:34.480
So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.420
When a cell connects together with a protein and

04:38.180 --> 04:41.600
recognizes it as enemy, it knows that it has to attack.

04:42.420 --> 04:49.000
Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader.

04:49.580 --> 04:56.340
But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces, this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces.

04:57.020 --> 05:02.000
This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year. The

05:02.380 --> 05:07.960
influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

05:08.620 --> 05:15.300
The soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.840
That's why they are your all-purpose weapons.

05:18.300 --> 05:25.100
But they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop.

05:25.540 --> 05:32.180
So the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and

05:32.420 --> 05:38.120
10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces, which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.380
But how is this possible?

05:40.380 --> 05:47.020
How could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece?

05:47.820 --> 05:52.020
Well, the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat code,

05:52.460 --> 05:57.220
mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.260
The details are way too complicated for this video,

06:00.260 --> 06:02.940
but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have

06:03.020 --> 06:09.900
official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different

06:10.180 --> 06:16.940
receptors. A good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own

06:16.940 --> 06:18.260
special recipe.

06:18.260 --> 06:26.260
They have 100 different ingredients to choose from. Each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor.

06:27.060 --> 06:31.620
So each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together.

06:32.020 --> 06:35.880
Maybe tomato, chicken, rice, and half an onion as entree,

06:36.380 --> 06:43.540
marshmallow, pepper, strawberries, and a quarter banana as a dessert. Or cucumber, beef, potatoes, and two carrots, and

06:43.900 --> 06:46.300
blueberries, chocolate, and cream with a pinch of cinnamon.

06:47.300 --> 06:53.540
Even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients, there are billions of possible recipes.

06:54.540 --> 06:59.820
And likewise, with just a small selection of gene fragments, your cells create billions of receptors.

07:00.300 --> 07:06.180
The details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book.

07:06.420 --> 07:11.980
In any case, by mixing up gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations.

07:12.580 --> 07:20.580
So in the end, you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor, the dish from our metaphor,

07:20.580 --> 07:24.220
that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece.

07:24.780 --> 07:29.500
In total, you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.060
But here we run into a pretty dangerous problem.

07:33.060 --> 07:38.940
If your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe,

07:39.100 --> 07:42.260
wouldn't it also make some that can attack your own cells?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.940
Yes, it happens all the time.

07:45.420 --> 07:52.060
This is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.380
The murder university of your thymus.

07:55.860 --> 08:01.100
Your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart, and you've probably never heard of it.

08:01.740 --> 08:06.380
Interestingly, your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age,

08:06.620 --> 08:09.780
because it's in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.420
But what does the thymus do?

08:12.860 --> 08:20.220
In your murder university, your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum.

08:21.300 --> 08:27.100
Basically, it's showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react.

08:27.820 --> 08:34.260
When a young cell recognizes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it, the teacher cells order them to kill themselves,

08:34.380 --> 08:36.900
and they are eaten up and recycled.

08:37.780 --> 08:41.660
The immune system is so particular about this process that around

08:42.420 --> 08:46.860
98% of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder university die there.

08:47.780 --> 08:51.900
2% graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real.

08:52.540 --> 08:59.420
If this process goes wrong and the cells escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces, this can lead to auto-immune disease,

08:59.780 --> 09:03.300
where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.500
And this, again, is another story for another time.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.380
Okay, let's summarize.

09:09.820 --> 09:17.220
Your immune system has two parts, one that defends you right after birth, and one that carries the largest library of super weapons in the universe,

09:17.580 --> 09:19.580
but needs to boot up first.

09:19.740 --> 09:26.400
To create billions of different super weapons, your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a

09:26.780 --> 09:28.780
breathtaking variety of attack weapons.

09:29.020 --> 09:35.020
Then they enter a murder university that only 2% survive to make sure they don't attack you, and

09:35.300 --> 09:41.940
then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.220
Now, wait a second. If this is all true, why do we get sick at all?

09:48.140 --> 09:55.380
Why was a new disease like COVID-19 able to kill millions of people? And how do vaccines boost the mechanisms

09:55.380 --> 10:00.020
we explained in this video to supercharge your immune system and defend you from the worst

10:00.220 --> 10:04.460
diseases humanity has ever encountered, from smallpox to COVID-19?

10:05.260 --> 10:12.900
Well, everything we've just learned about is a tiny, tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day

10:13.020 --> 10:17.140
inside your body, and there are so many amazing details and questions here.

10:17.460 --> 10:21.300
How does your body actually find the right cell in time to protect you?

10:21.660 --> 10:29.420
How do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway? And what about all the things that didn't fit in this video?

10:30.580 --> 10:37.300
Well, today finally marks the release of Immune, a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive,

10:37.740 --> 10:41.460
written by Philip Detmer, the founder and head writer of Kurzgesagt.

10:41.820 --> 10:47.980
First, we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble, and then because so many of you pre-ordered that we didn't have enough

10:48.020 --> 10:51.940
copies for the original launch day. Thank you so, so much for that.

10:52.780 --> 10:58.700
Immune tells the epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body, how you

10:58.940 --> 11:00.940
experience being sick and healthy.

11:00.940 --> 11:04.740
The book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kurzgesagt videos,

11:04.820 --> 11:11.020
but is able to dive way deeper into its subjects, so go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself.

11:11.540 --> 11:16.460
Witness deadly wars between billions of invaders and cells, learn how your immune system

11:16.780 --> 11:20.740
actually works and protects you from cuts, cancer, and COVID.

11:21.300 --> 11:25.700
Never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity works.

11:26.420 --> 11:30.260
Immune is fun and great to look at, and it even smells good.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.060
Follow the link in the description to order it today.

11:33.660 --> 11:40.180
This is the end of a decade-long personal journey working on this, so thank you all so, so much for your support, and

11:40.620 --> 11:42.900
thank you for watching and reading.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.460
you
