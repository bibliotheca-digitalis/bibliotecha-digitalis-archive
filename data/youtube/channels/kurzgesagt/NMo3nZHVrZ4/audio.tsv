720	4080	For most of our history, the human population grew slowly,
4080	7840	until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer.
8480	11920	In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.
12800	16080	This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.
16720	20480	But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.
21360	25920	Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.
26480	31840	The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.
32800	35200	But the big picture conceals the details.
35920	39520	Let's look at one region in particular, Sub-Saharan Africa.
40080	44400	In 2019, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries.
45040	48320	Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades,
48320	50720	it's still much higher than in the rest of the world.
51280	55360	While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people,
55360	58800	others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100.
59520	63200	Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society.
63200	66560	But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.
67360	70240	So, is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed?
70240	74160	And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?
74720	76640	As always, it's complicated.
77360	82400	Sub-Saharan Africa is a made-up idea, and in many ways an unhelpful one.
82400	87040	Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone as Ireland is from Kazakhstan,
87040	88720	and they have about as much in common.
89280	93200	But without generalizing a little bit, this video would be an hour long.
94080	96960	We've also talked to many different scientists for this video,
96960	98640	and they disagreed on a lot of things.
99680	102800	Mainly on how much fertility matters to poverty.
103920	107040	We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us,
107040	108480	but take it with a grain of salt,
108480	112240	and check out our sources where we discuss this in more detail.
112320	115280	Okay, let's zoom out to the global perspective again.
116480	121760	A few decades ago, many countries in Asia were at a similar point as Sub-Saharan Africa today.
122400	125360	Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty,
125360	126960	and birth rates were very high.
127680	129120	Take Bangladesh.
129120	133040	In the 1960s, the average woman had seven children in her lifetime.
133680	136320	25% of them died before they turned five,
136320	140400	and of the ones that survived, only one in five would learn to read and write.
141120	143440	Life expectancy was around 45,
143440	146320	and per capita income was among the lowest in the world.
147280	152000	So beginning in the 1960s, Bangladesh started a family planning program,
152000	153520	based on three main pillars.
154400	157600	One, education helped to change women's outlook.
158160	162480	Women with a higher education tend to want fewer kids and become mothers later in life.
163280	166400	Two, better healthcare lowered child mortality,
166480	170400	leading to parents wanting fewer children because they could expect them to survive.
171600	176320	Three, field workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas,
176320	182160	which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975 to 76% in 2019.
182880	186800	Together, these measures greatly slowed down population growth.
187520	191360	In 1960, the average Bangladeshi woman had seven kids,
191360	195760	in 1995, four, and in 2019, it was down to two.
196480	199760	This also changed the country's demographics and the economy.
200320	204480	Before, many children were born but died before they got to contribute to society.
205040	208800	As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born, things change.
209360	212160	Kids get an education and turn into productive adults.
212960	215360	The government was able to shift some of their resources
215360	218240	from lowering child mortality to boosting the economy.
219440	223840	By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of
223840	227040	least developed countries to the status of a developing economy.
228000	232000	Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand, or the Philippines
232000	235040	have gone through a similar process, often even faster.
235840	238960	Investment in health and education led to lower birth rates,
238960	243600	which changed the composition of the population and enabled governments to boost the economy.
244560	247920	Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa?
248480	252880	Africa as a whole has made considerable progress with childhood mortality.
252880	255040	But especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
255040	258560	education has improved slower than in other parts of the world.
258560	262640	And while in total contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990,
262640	267280	the unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about 60%.
268320	272400	The reasons for this are complicated, and it's impossible to give a single answer here.
273040	277840	Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people, but there are a few main factors.
278480	283760	Many sub-Saharan nations have suffered under colonization until only a few decades ago,
283760	287280	and had rough transition periods towards independence.
287280	291280	The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity.
292000	295840	Some areas have been repeatedly wracked by civil wars, military conflicts,
295840	298000	or suffered under unstable governments,
298000	301120	which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and healthcare.
301840	304480	So Africa had a worse starting point than Asia.
305120	310080	Foreign aid and how it was applied, especially during the Cold War, is also a contentious issue.
310880	314080	But this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences,
314080	316320	so we'll make a whole video about it in the future.
317520	321280	And lastly, there are cultural aspects that make talking about family planning
321280	323040	in the context of Africa difficult.
323840	328960	Critics say that trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition.
328960	332080	But not speaking about an issue will not help solve it.
332800	335680	Not all of these things apply to every country in the region.
335680	339680	We're talking about 46 countries after all, some of them deeply troubled,
339680	343440	others already flourishing, all different and facing unique problems.
344080	346960	If population growth continues at its present rate,
346960	351920	then sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2100.
352800	354320	Okay, so what can be done?
354960	356640	Actually, a lot.
356640	361120	Especially investment and aid that help to build systems for education,
361120	362880	family planning, and healthcare.
363680	367040	Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact.
367760	372960	For example, if women get a better education and have their first child just two years later in life.
373840	376800	This tiny gap between this generation and the next one
376800	382320	would lead to 400 million fewer people in 2100, with 3.6 billion in total.
383760	388000	If education and family planning are made available to every African woman,
388000	391840	universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision.
392400	395120	If families get to choose how many kids they want,
395120	399120	birth projections fall by 30% to 2.8 billion people.
400400	402160	This isn't just theory.
402160	405520	There are already examples that are reason for optimism.
405520	408640	Ethiopia, the African country with the second biggest population,
408640	411600	has made a lot of progress in a relatively short amount of time.
412160	418640	Improving health services led to a drop in child mortality from 20% to 7% since 1990.
419360	423520	And up to 30% of the annual budget was invested in education
423520	427200	and the number of schools increased 25-fold over two decades.
428080	433440	So, summarizing, there are serious challenges ahead, but they are far from unsolvable.
434160	438800	Sub-Saharan Africa does not need pity or gifts, but attention and fair investment.
439280	442640	It's a region rich in resources, culture and potential.
443280	445760	If things go right, we'll see a turnaround
445760	450640	similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the last 30 years.
