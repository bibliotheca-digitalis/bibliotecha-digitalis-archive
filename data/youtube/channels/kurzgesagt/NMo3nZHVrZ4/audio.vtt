00:00.720 --> 00:04.080
For most of our history, the human population grew slowly,

00:04.080 --> 00:07.840
until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.920
In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.080
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.480
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.920
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.840
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.200
But the big picture conceals the details.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.520
Let's look at one region in particular, Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.400
In 2019, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.320
Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades,

00:48.320 --> 00:50.720
it's still much higher than in the rest of the world.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.360
While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people,

00:55.360 --> 00:58.800
others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.200
Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.560
But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.240
So, is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed?

01:10.240 --> 01:14.160
And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.640
As always, it's complicated.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.400
Sub-Saharan Africa is a made-up idea, and in many ways an unhelpful one.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.040
Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone as Ireland is from Kazakhstan,

01:27.040 --> 01:28.720
and they have about as much in common.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.200
But without generalizing a little bit, this video would be an hour long.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.960
We've also talked to many different scientists for this video,

01:36.960 --> 01:38.640
and they disagreed on a lot of things.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.800
Mainly on how much fertility matters to poverty.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.040
We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us,

01:47.040 --> 01:48.480
but take it with a grain of salt,

01:48.480 --> 01:52.240
and check out our sources where we discuss this in more detail.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.280
Okay, let's zoom out to the global perspective again.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.760
A few decades ago, many countries in Asia were at a similar point as Sub-Saharan Africa today.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.360
Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty,

02:05.360 --> 02:06.960
and birth rates were very high.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.120
Take Bangladesh.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.040
In the 1960s, the average woman had seven children in her lifetime.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.320
25% of them died before they turned five,

02:16.320 --> 02:20.400
and of the ones that survived, only one in five would learn to read and write.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.440
Life expectancy was around 45,

02:23.440 --> 02:26.320
and per capita income was among the lowest in the world.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.000
So beginning in the 1960s, Bangladesh started a family planning program,

02:32.000 --> 02:33.520
based on three main pillars.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.600
One, education helped to change women's outlook.

02:38.160 --> 02:42.480
Women with a higher education tend to want fewer kids and become mothers later in life.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.400
Two, better healthcare lowered child mortality,

02:46.480 --> 02:50.400
leading to parents wanting fewer children because they could expect them to survive.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.320
Three, field workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas,

02:56.320 --> 03:02.160
which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975 to 76% in 2019.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.800
Together, these measures greatly slowed down population growth.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.360
In 1960, the average Bangladeshi woman had seven kids,

03:11.360 --> 03:15.760
in 1995, four, and in 2019, it was down to two.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.760
This also changed the country's demographics and the economy.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.480
Before, many children were born but died before they got to contribute to society.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.800
As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born, things change.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.160
Kids get an education and turn into productive adults.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.360
The government was able to shift some of their resources

03:35.360 --> 03:38.240
from lowering child mortality to boosting the economy.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.840
By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of

03:43.840 --> 03:47.040
least developed countries to the status of a developing economy.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand, or the Philippines

03:52.000 --> 03:55.040
have gone through a similar process, often even faster.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.960
Investment in health and education led to lower birth rates,

03:58.960 --> 04:03.600
which changed the composition of the population and enabled governments to boost the economy.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.920
Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa?

04:08.480 --> 04:12.880
Africa as a whole has made considerable progress with childhood mortality.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.040
But especially in sub-Saharan Africa,

04:15.040 --> 04:18.560
education has improved slower than in other parts of the world.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.640
And while in total contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990,

04:22.640 --> 04:27.280
the unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about 60%.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.400
The reasons for this are complicated, and it's impossible to give a single answer here.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.840
Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people, but there are a few main factors.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.760
Many sub-Saharan nations have suffered under colonization until only a few decades ago,

04:43.760 --> 04:47.280
and had rough transition periods towards independence.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.280
The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.840
Some areas have been repeatedly wracked by civil wars, military conflicts,

04:55.840 --> 04:58.000
or suffered under unstable governments,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.120
which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and healthcare.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.480
So Africa had a worse starting point than Asia.

05:05.120 --> 05:10.080
Foreign aid and how it was applied, especially during the Cold War, is also a contentious issue.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.080
But this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences,

05:14.080 --> 05:16.320
so we'll make a whole video about it in the future.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.280
And lastly, there are cultural aspects that make talking about family planning

05:21.280 --> 05:23.040
in the context of Africa difficult.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.960
Critics say that trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.080
But not speaking about an issue will not help solve it.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.680
Not all of these things apply to every country in the region.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.680
We're talking about 46 countries after all, some of them deeply troubled,

05:39.680 --> 05:43.440
others already flourishing, all different and facing unique problems.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.960
If population growth continues at its present rate,

05:46.960 --> 05:51.920
then sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2100.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.320
Okay, so what can be done?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.640
Actually, a lot.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.120
Especially investment and aid that help to build systems for education,

06:01.120 --> 06:02.880
family planning, and healthcare.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.040
Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.960
For example, if women get a better education and have their first child just two years later in life.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.800
This tiny gap between this generation and the next one

06:16.800 --> 06:22.320
would lead to 400 million fewer people in 2100, with 3.6 billion in total.

06:23.760 --> 06:28.000
If education and family planning are made available to every African woman,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.840
universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.120
If families get to choose how many kids they want,

06:35.120 --> 06:39.120
birth projections fall by 30% to 2.8 billion people.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.160
This isn't just theory.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.520
There are already examples that are reason for optimism.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.640
Ethiopia, the African country with the second biggest population,

06:48.640 --> 06:51.600
has made a lot of progress in a relatively short amount of time.

06:52.160 --> 06:58.640
Improving health services led to a drop in child mortality from 20% to 7% since 1990.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.520
And up to 30% of the annual budget was invested in education

07:03.520 --> 07:07.200
and the number of schools increased 25-fold over two decades.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.440
So, summarizing, there are serious challenges ahead, but they are far from unsolvable.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.800
Sub-Saharan Africa does not need pity or gifts, but attention and fair investment.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.640
It's a region rich in resources, culture and potential.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.760
If things go right, we'll see a turnaround

07:25.760 --> 07:30.640
similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the last 30 years.
