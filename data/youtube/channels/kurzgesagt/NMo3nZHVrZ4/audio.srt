1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,080
For most of our history, the human population grew slowly,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,840
until new discoveries brought us more food and made us live longer.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,920
In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,480
But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
But the big picture conceals the details.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
Let's look at one region in particular, Sub-Saharan Africa.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,400
In 2019, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,320
Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades,

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,720
it's still much higher than in the rest of the world.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people,

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,560
But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
So, is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,160
And why do the projections vary by 2.4 billion people?

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
As always, it's complicated.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,400
Sub-Saharan Africa is a made-up idea, and in many ways an unhelpful one.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone as Ireland is from Kazakhstan,

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
and they have about as much in common.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
But without generalizing a little bit, this video would be an hour long.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,960
We've also talked to many different scientists for this video,

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
and they disagreed on a lot of things.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,800
Mainly on how much fertility matters to poverty.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us,

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,480
but take it with a grain of salt,

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,240
and check out our sources where we discuss this in more detail.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
Okay, let's zoom out to the global perspective again.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,760
A few decades ago, many countries in Asia were at a similar point as Sub-Saharan Africa today.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,360
Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty,

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
and birth rates were very high.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,120
Take Bangladesh.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,040
In the 1960s, the average woman had seven children in her lifetime.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,320
25% of them died before they turned five,

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,400
and of the ones that survived, only one in five would learn to read and write.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,440
Life expectancy was around 45,

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,320
and per capita income was among the lowest in the world.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
So beginning in the 1960s, Bangladesh started a family planning program,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
based on three main pillars.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,600
One, education helped to change women's outlook.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
Women with a higher education tend to want fewer kids and become mothers later in life.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
Two, better healthcare lowered child mortality,

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
leading to parents wanting fewer children because they could expect them to survive.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,320
Three, field workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas,

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,160
which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975 to 76% in 2019.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,800
Together, these measures greatly slowed down population growth.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,360
In 1960, the average Bangladeshi woman had seven kids,

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
in 1995, four, and in 2019, it was down to two.

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
This also changed the country's demographics and the economy.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,480
Before, many children were born but died before they got to contribute to society.

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,800
As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born, things change.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,160
Kids get an education and turn into productive adults.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
The government was able to shift some of their resources

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,240
from lowering child mortality to boosting the economy.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,840
By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of

58
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
least developed countries to the status of a developing economy.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand, or the Philippines

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
have gone through a similar process, often even faster.

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,960
Investment in health and education led to lower birth rates,

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,600
which changed the composition of the population and enabled governments to boost the economy.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa?

64
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,880
Africa as a whole has made considerable progress with childhood mortality.

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,040
But especially in sub-Saharan Africa,

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
education has improved slower than in other parts of the world.

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,640
And while in total contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990,

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,280
the unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about 60%.

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
The reasons for this are complicated, and it's impossible to give a single answer here.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,840
Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people, but there are a few main factors.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,760
Many sub-Saharan nations have suffered under colonization until only a few decades ago,

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,280
and had rough transition periods towards independence.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,280
The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
Some areas have been repeatedly wracked by civil wars, military conflicts,

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
or suffered under unstable governments,

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,120
which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and healthcare.

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,480
So Africa had a worse starting point than Asia.

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Foreign aid and how it was applied, especially during the Cold War, is also a contentious issue.

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
But this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences,

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
so we'll make a whole video about it in the future.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
And lastly, there are cultural aspects that make talking about family planning

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,040
in the context of Africa difficult.

83
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,960
Critics say that trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
But not speaking about an issue will not help solve it.

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
Not all of these things apply to every country in the region.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,680
We're talking about 46 countries after all, some of them deeply troubled,

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
others already flourishing, all different and facing unique problems.

88
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,960
If population growth continues at its present rate,

89
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,920
then sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2100.

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
Okay, so what can be done?

91
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,640
Actually, a lot.

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,120
Especially investment and aid that help to build systems for education,

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
family planning, and healthcare.

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,040
Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact.

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,960
For example, if women get a better education and have their first child just two years later in life.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,800
This tiny gap between this generation and the next one

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,320
would lead to 400 million fewer people in 2100, with 3.6 billion in total.

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,000
If education and family planning are made available to every African woman,

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,840
universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision.

100
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
If families get to choose how many kids they want,

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
birth projections fall by 30% to 2.8 billion people.

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
This isn't just theory.

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
There are already examples that are reason for optimism.

104
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Ethiopia, the African country with the second biggest population,

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,600
has made a lot of progress in a relatively short amount of time.

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,640
Improving health services led to a drop in child mortality from 20% to 7% since 1990.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,520
And up to 30% of the annual budget was invested in education

108
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,200
and the number of schools increased 25-fold over two decades.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,440
So, summarizing, there are serious challenges ahead, but they are far from unsolvable.

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,800
Sub-Saharan Africa does not need pity or gifts, but attention and fair investment.

111
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
It's a region rich in resources, culture and potential.

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,760
If things go right, we'll see a turnaround

113
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,640
similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the last 30 years.
