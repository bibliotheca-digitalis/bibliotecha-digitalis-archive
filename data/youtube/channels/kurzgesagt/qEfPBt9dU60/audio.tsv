560	5520	What would happen if we were to detonate a very, very powerful nuclear weapon on the Moon?
6160	10960	Would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth, causing tidal waves and misery?
11600	16160	Could the Moon be destroyed, showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric death?
16160	30400	During the Cold War, the Moon was a major target for space exploration and, you know,
30400	36640	military bases. So, the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear
36640	42560	detonation on the surface of the Moon. But just quoting stuff is boring, so let's conduct a very
42560	49040	important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100 megaton thermonuclear warhead about twice as
49040	55280	powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated. We'll also place a number of curious astronauts
55280	62640	around the Moon as observers. Let's push the button and slow down time. For the first few
62640	68960	milliseconds, nothing much happens outside our weapon. Meanwhile, inside, high explosives send
68960	74640	a shockwave to a radioactive metal core, compressing it so much that it reaches criticality
74640	80800	and starts a nuclear fission chain reaction. The 100 million degree plasma created in this first
80800	86480	stage sets off the second stage with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star.
87280	93840	Very briefly, our weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe. And only now,
93840	98720	barely 10 milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened,
98720	106000	as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born. So far, so good.
106000	110800	But everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one
110800	117440	major difference. There's no atmosphere. As the fireball shines, it releases a flash of X-rays
117440	123680	and thermal photons, a wave of silent heat, which rushes outwards in all directions. On Earth,
123680	129280	this heat would char and burn everything within a 50 kilometer radius at least. But on the moon,
129280	135200	without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air, there's no burning at all. Also, there are no things to
135200	142080	burn. The crunchy topsoil of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals chewed to dust by eons of
142080	147920	meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water. When heated by the explosion, X-rays from the
147920	152640	fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface, while the unlucky dust that's
152640	158160	inside the fireball melts into glass. Any astronauts watching the show within about 50
158160	164240	kilometers can expect to be fried. And now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between
164240	170640	explosions in space and on Earth. On Earth, the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble.
170640	175040	Its expansion is violently stopped within moments by the pressure of the atmosphere.
175680	181280	But this is not good news. As the fireball rams the atmosphere, it produces the most destructive
181280	186800	part of a nuclear explosion on Earth, the shockwave. Compressed air around the explosion
186800	191280	rushes out faster than the speed of sound, shattering buildings and roaring so loud it
191280	197440	ruptures organs. But on the moon, there is no shockwave. No atmosphere means nothing to impede
197440	203760	the expanding explosion in space. On the moon, the fireball just grows in eerie silence, as there's
203760	209040	no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice. This would be an amazing thing to watch from a
209040	214640	safe distance. Unfortunately, there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on
214640	220400	the moon. Without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA,
220400	224800	anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.
225440	231120	But of course, that's not all. While all of this happens, the explosion hammers against the moon,
231120	236640	transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves, powering an intense
236640	242320	moonquake. The moon is much smaller than the Earth, and our astronauts will feel an inescapable
242320	247440	violent shaking no matter where they're standing. Comparable to an earthquake of seven on the
247440	252640	Richter scale, this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built
252640	257600	anywhere on the moon. Those who hid on the far side of the moon would have no idea it was an
257600	261760	explosion. The quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck.
262640	268640	And it's not over yet. Where our bomb explodes, the ground splatters like water when a rock
268640	274640	strikes a pond. As the explosion pushes against the surface, it may excavate as much as a hundred
274640	280240	million cubic meters of dust and rock, forming a crater eight kilometers across, while bedrock is
280240	287440	pulverized to rubble. Debris is shot into the sky in every direction. Again, without an atmosphere,
287440	293360	there's no drag to slow any of it down. Much of the debris scattered never returns to the moon,
293360	299680	flying off faster than escape velocity. A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore
299680	304880	the solar system, many of which will rain down on the Earth, though few will be larger than pebbles.
305680	310800	Any satellite, astronaut, or space station in the way, though, will have a really bad time.
311600	316480	Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles, allowing them to spread all over the
316560	321760	surface of the moon. Like bullets, they'll punch through our curious astronauts,
321760	329200	no matter where they stand. Finally, our explosion comes to an end. On Earth, the fireball rises like
329200	334640	a hot air balloon, forming a sort of stalk. As it reaches up, cooler air is drawn in around it,
334640	340320	rounding the top into a mushroom cloud. But on the moon, well, you know by now, no atmosphere,
340320	345360	no mushroom. The larger the plasma gets, the cooler it becomes, and the less energy it has
345360	350560	to make interesting or terrifying things happen. Within seconds of pulling the trigger,
350560	356480	the bubble reddens and fades from view. It would be visible from the Earth, like a star flickering
356480	364000	to life, only to fade out right away. A spark, and then nothing. As the cloud of tiny debris reaches
364000	369440	far above the surface of the moon, it's illuminated by the sun for a few minutes, giving it an eerie
369440	376800	beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle. What about the moon's orbit? It's basically
376800	381840	unchanged. Trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.
382400	389440	Nuclear explosions may be big, but space is bigger. Our mighty explosion just leaves another
389440	395920	crater, one among millions. Still, anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.
396480	400880	The material that ends up raining back to the moon is radioactive, and without any natural
400880	406640	processes to wash it away or bury it, the surface of the moon will remain contaminated. Although,
406640	411360	fortunately, the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural levels
411360	417440	from cosmic rays in about a year. In conclusion, we can say with confidence that while the moon
417440	423280	itself does not care about being nuked, and will barely notice, using the moon as a nuclear test
423280	427920	ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something
427920	437360	useful. So maybe we should just not do that. This was our last video of the year 12,020 and
437360	442560	oh dear what an interesting and weird year it's been in all the worst ways. But it's finally over.
442560	447840	We want to end it by saying thank you. We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things
447920	453280	because of you burps. This year our German channel reached a million subscribers. We launched our
453280	459200	Spanish one and released our first app. If everything goes well, we can finally start our
459200	464400	largest new project to date next year. But we know better than to promise too much. All of this works
464400	470720	because you support us directly. Thank you so much. We genuinely appreciate it. If you want to
470720	475600	help us out too and get something cool in return to the tune of nuking the moon, we've made a new
475600	481120	minimalistic infographic poster about the moon and how incredibly far away it is. Also there's
481120	487840	a baby duck, our cutest plushie yet, a new duck and friends enamel mug, our new ocean explorer
487840	493440	notebook, and so much more. All made with love and care. Let us know what you like and we'll make
493440	500240	more of it. Okay, let's wrap up this video and this year. Thank you again for watching and caring
500240	505600	and sharing. We hope that you slide peacefully into the year 12,021.
505600	520560	Let's all hope it will be a really boring year.
