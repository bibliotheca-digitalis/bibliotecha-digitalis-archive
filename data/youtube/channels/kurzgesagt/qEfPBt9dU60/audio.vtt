00:00.560 --> 00:05.520
What would happen if we were to detonate a very, very powerful nuclear weapon on the Moon?

00:06.160 --> 00:10.960
Would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth, causing tidal waves and misery?

00:11.600 --> 00:16.160
Could the Moon be destroyed, showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric death?

00:16.160 --> 00:30.400
During the Cold War, the Moon was a major target for space exploration and, you know,

00:30.400 --> 00:36.640
military bases. So, the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear

00:36.640 --> 00:42.560
detonation on the surface of the Moon. But just quoting stuff is boring, so let's conduct a very

00:42.560 --> 00:49.040
important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100 megaton thermonuclear warhead about twice as

00:49.040 --> 00:55.280
powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated. We'll also place a number of curious astronauts

00:55.280 --> 01:02.640
around the Moon as observers. Let's push the button and slow down time. For the first few

01:02.640 --> 01:08.960
milliseconds, nothing much happens outside our weapon. Meanwhile, inside, high explosives send

01:08.960 --> 01:14.640
a shockwave to a radioactive metal core, compressing it so much that it reaches criticality

01:14.640 --> 01:20.800
and starts a nuclear fission chain reaction. The 100 million degree plasma created in this first

01:20.800 --> 01:26.480
stage sets off the second stage with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star.

01:27.280 --> 01:33.840
Very briefly, our weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe. And only now,

01:33.840 --> 01:38.720
barely 10 milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened,

01:38.720 --> 01:46.000
as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born. So far, so good.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.800
But everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one

01:50.800 --> 01:57.440
major difference. There's no atmosphere. As the fireball shines, it releases a flash of X-rays

01:57.440 --> 02:03.680
and thermal photons, a wave of silent heat, which rushes outwards in all directions. On Earth,

02:03.680 --> 02:09.280
this heat would char and burn everything within a 50 kilometer radius at least. But on the moon,

02:09.280 --> 02:15.200
without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air, there's no burning at all. Also, there are no things to

02:15.200 --> 02:22.080
burn. The crunchy topsoil of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals chewed to dust by eons of

02:22.080 --> 02:27.920
meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water. When heated by the explosion, X-rays from the

02:27.920 --> 02:32.640
fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface, while the unlucky dust that's

02:32.640 --> 02:38.160
inside the fireball melts into glass. Any astronauts watching the show within about 50

02:38.160 --> 02:44.240
kilometers can expect to be fried. And now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between

02:44.240 --> 02:50.640
explosions in space and on Earth. On Earth, the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.040
Its expansion is violently stopped within moments by the pressure of the atmosphere.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.280
But this is not good news. As the fireball rams the atmosphere, it produces the most destructive

03:01.280 --> 03:06.800
part of a nuclear explosion on Earth, the shockwave. Compressed air around the explosion

03:06.800 --> 03:11.280
rushes out faster than the speed of sound, shattering buildings and roaring so loud it

03:11.280 --> 03:17.440
ruptures organs. But on the moon, there is no shockwave. No atmosphere means nothing to impede

03:17.440 --> 03:23.760
the expanding explosion in space. On the moon, the fireball just grows in eerie silence, as there's

03:23.760 --> 03:29.040
no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice. This would be an amazing thing to watch from a

03:29.040 --> 03:34.640
safe distance. Unfortunately, there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on

03:34.640 --> 03:40.400
the moon. Without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA,

03:40.400 --> 03:44.800
anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.

03:45.440 --> 03:51.120
But of course, that's not all. While all of this happens, the explosion hammers against the moon,

03:51.120 --> 03:56.640
transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves, powering an intense

03:56.640 --> 04:02.320
moonquake. The moon is much smaller than the Earth, and our astronauts will feel an inescapable

04:02.320 --> 04:07.440
violent shaking no matter where they're standing. Comparable to an earthquake of seven on the

04:07.440 --> 04:12.640
Richter scale, this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built

04:12.640 --> 04:17.600
anywhere on the moon. Those who hid on the far side of the moon would have no idea it was an

04:17.600 --> 04:21.760
explosion. The quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck.

04:22.640 --> 04:28.640
And it's not over yet. Where our bomb explodes, the ground splatters like water when a rock

04:28.640 --> 04:34.640
strikes a pond. As the explosion pushes against the surface, it may excavate as much as a hundred

04:34.640 --> 04:40.240
million cubic meters of dust and rock, forming a crater eight kilometers across, while bedrock is

04:40.240 --> 04:47.440
pulverized to rubble. Debris is shot into the sky in every direction. Again, without an atmosphere,

04:47.440 --> 04:53.360
there's no drag to slow any of it down. Much of the debris scattered never returns to the moon,

04:53.360 --> 04:59.680
flying off faster than escape velocity. A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore

04:59.680 --> 05:04.880
the solar system, many of which will rain down on the Earth, though few will be larger than pebbles.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.800
Any satellite, astronaut, or space station in the way, though, will have a really bad time.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.480
Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles, allowing them to spread all over the

05:16.560 --> 05:21.760
surface of the moon. Like bullets, they'll punch through our curious astronauts,

05:21.760 --> 05:29.200
no matter where they stand. Finally, our explosion comes to an end. On Earth, the fireball rises like

05:29.200 --> 05:34.640
a hot air balloon, forming a sort of stalk. As it reaches up, cooler air is drawn in around it,

05:34.640 --> 05:40.320
rounding the top into a mushroom cloud. But on the moon, well, you know by now, no atmosphere,

05:40.320 --> 05:45.360
no mushroom. The larger the plasma gets, the cooler it becomes, and the less energy it has

05:45.360 --> 05:50.560
to make interesting or terrifying things happen. Within seconds of pulling the trigger,

05:50.560 --> 05:56.480
the bubble reddens and fades from view. It would be visible from the Earth, like a star flickering

05:56.480 --> 06:04.000
to life, only to fade out right away. A spark, and then nothing. As the cloud of tiny debris reaches

06:04.000 --> 06:09.440
far above the surface of the moon, it's illuminated by the sun for a few minutes, giving it an eerie

06:09.440 --> 06:16.800
beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle. What about the moon's orbit? It's basically

06:16.800 --> 06:21.840
unchanged. Trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.

06:22.400 --> 06:29.440
Nuclear explosions may be big, but space is bigger. Our mighty explosion just leaves another

06:29.440 --> 06:35.920
crater, one among millions. Still, anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.880
The material that ends up raining back to the moon is radioactive, and without any natural

06:40.880 --> 06:46.640
processes to wash it away or bury it, the surface of the moon will remain contaminated. Although,

06:46.640 --> 06:51.360
fortunately, the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural levels

06:51.360 --> 06:57.440
from cosmic rays in about a year. In conclusion, we can say with confidence that while the moon

06:57.440 --> 07:03.280
itself does not care about being nuked, and will barely notice, using the moon as a nuclear test

07:03.280 --> 07:07.920
ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something

07:07.920 --> 07:17.360
useful. So maybe we should just not do that. This was our last video of the year 12,020 and

07:17.360 --> 07:22.560
oh dear what an interesting and weird year it's been in all the worst ways. But it's finally over.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.840
We want to end it by saying thank you. We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things

07:27.920 --> 07:33.280
because of you burps. This year our German channel reached a million subscribers. We launched our

07:33.280 --> 07:39.200
Spanish one and released our first app. If everything goes well, we can finally start our

07:39.200 --> 07:44.400
largest new project to date next year. But we know better than to promise too much. All of this works

07:44.400 --> 07:50.720
because you support us directly. Thank you so much. We genuinely appreciate it. If you want to

07:50.720 --> 07:55.600
help us out too and get something cool in return to the tune of nuking the moon, we've made a new

07:55.600 --> 08:01.120
minimalistic infographic poster about the moon and how incredibly far away it is. Also there's

08:01.120 --> 08:07.840
a baby duck, our cutest plushie yet, a new duck and friends enamel mug, our new ocean explorer

08:07.840 --> 08:13.440
notebook, and so much more. All made with love and care. Let us know what you like and we'll make

08:13.440 --> 08:20.240
more of it. Okay, let's wrap up this video and this year. Thank you again for watching and caring

08:20.240 --> 08:25.600
and sharing. We hope that you slide peacefully into the year 12,021.

08:25.600 --> 08:40.560
Let's all hope it will be a really boring year.
