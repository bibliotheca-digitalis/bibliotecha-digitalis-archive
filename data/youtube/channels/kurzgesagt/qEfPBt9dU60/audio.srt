1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,520
What would happen if we were to detonate a very, very powerful nuclear weapon on the Moon?

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,960
Would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth, causing tidal waves and misery?

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,160
Could the Moon be destroyed, showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric death?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:30,400
During the Cold War, the Moon was a major target for space exploration and, you know,

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,640
military bases. So, the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,560
detonation on the surface of the Moon. But just quoting stuff is boring, so let's conduct a very

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,040
important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100 megaton thermonuclear warhead about twice as

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,280
powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated. We'll also place a number of curious astronauts

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,640
around the Moon as observers. Let's push the button and slow down time. For the first few

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,960
milliseconds, nothing much happens outside our weapon. Meanwhile, inside, high explosives send

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
a shockwave to a radioactive metal core, compressing it so much that it reaches criticality

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,800
and starts a nuclear fission chain reaction. The 100 million degree plasma created in this first

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,480
stage sets off the second stage with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,840
Very briefly, our weapon contains one of the hottest places in the universe. And only now,

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
barely 10 milliseconds later, does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened,

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,000
as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born. So far, so good.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,800
But everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,440
major difference. There's no atmosphere. As the fireball shines, it releases a flash of X-rays

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,680
and thermal photons, a wave of silent heat, which rushes outwards in all directions. On Earth,

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,280
this heat would char and burn everything within a 50 kilometer radius at least. But on the moon,

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,200
without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air, there's no burning at all. Also, there are no things to

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,080
burn. The crunchy topsoil of the moon is made from silicate rock and metals chewed to dust by eons of

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,920
meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water. When heated by the explosion, X-rays from the

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,640
fireball vaporize a thin cloud of rock from the lunar surface, while the unlucky dust that's

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
inside the fireball melts into glass. Any astronauts watching the show within about 50

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,240
kilometers can expect to be fried. And now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,640
explosions in space and on Earth. On Earth, the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble.

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
Its expansion is violently stopped within moments by the pressure of the atmosphere.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,280
But this is not good news. As the fireball rams the atmosphere, it produces the most destructive

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,800
part of a nuclear explosion on Earth, the shockwave. Compressed air around the explosion

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
rushes out faster than the speed of sound, shattering buildings and roaring so loud it

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,440
ruptures organs. But on the moon, there is no shockwave. No atmosphere means nothing to impede

33
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,760
the expanding explosion in space. On the moon, the fireball just grows in eerie silence, as there's

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice. This would be an amazing thing to watch from a

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,640
safe distance. Unfortunately, there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,400
the moon. Without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA,

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,800
anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation.

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,120
But of course, that's not all. While all of this happens, the explosion hammers against the moon,

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves, powering an intense

40
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,320
moonquake. The moon is much smaller than the Earth, and our astronauts will feel an inescapable

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,440
violent shaking no matter where they're standing. Comparable to an earthquake of seven on the

42
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,640
Richter scale, this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,600
anywhere on the moon. Those who hid on the far side of the moon would have no idea it was an

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,760
explosion. The quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck.

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,640
And it's not over yet. Where our bomb explodes, the ground splatters like water when a rock

46
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,640
strikes a pond. As the explosion pushes against the surface, it may excavate as much as a hundred

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,240
million cubic meters of dust and rock, forming a crater eight kilometers across, while bedrock is

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,440
pulverized to rubble. Debris is shot into the sky in every direction. Again, without an atmosphere,

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,360
there's no drag to slow any of it down. Much of the debris scattered never returns to the moon,

50
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,680
flying off faster than escape velocity. A flurry of micrometeorites have been cast off to explore

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,880
the solar system, many of which will rain down on the Earth, though few will be larger than pebbles.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,800
Any satellite, astronaut, or space station in the way, though, will have a really bad time.

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,480
Micrometeorites are launched at many speeds and angles, allowing them to spread all over the

54
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,760
surface of the moon. Like bullets, they'll punch through our curious astronauts,

55
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,200
no matter where they stand. Finally, our explosion comes to an end. On Earth, the fireball rises like

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,640
a hot air balloon, forming a sort of stalk. As it reaches up, cooler air is drawn in around it,

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,320
rounding the top into a mushroom cloud. But on the moon, well, you know by now, no atmosphere,

58
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,360
no mushroom. The larger the plasma gets, the cooler it becomes, and the less energy it has

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,560
to make interesting or terrifying things happen. Within seconds of pulling the trigger,

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,480
the bubble reddens and fades from view. It would be visible from the Earth, like a star flickering

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:04,000
to life, only to fade out right away. A spark, and then nothing. As the cloud of tiny debris reaches

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,440
far above the surface of the moon, it's illuminated by the sun for a few minutes, giving it an eerie

63
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,800
beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle. What about the moon's orbit? It's basically

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,840
unchanged. Trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it.

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,440
Nuclear explosions may be big, but space is bigger. Our mighty explosion just leaves another

66
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,920
crater, one among millions. Still, anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves.

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,880
The material that ends up raining back to the moon is radioactive, and without any natural

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,640
processes to wash it away or bury it, the surface of the moon will remain contaminated. Although,

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,360
fortunately, the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to natural levels

70
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,440
from cosmic rays in about a year. In conclusion, we can say with confidence that while the moon

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,280
itself does not care about being nuked, and will barely notice, using the moon as a nuclear test

72
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,920
ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something

73
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:17,360
useful. So maybe we should just not do that. This was our last video of the year 12,020 and

74
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,560
oh dear what an interesting and weird year it's been in all the worst ways. But it's finally over.

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,840
We want to end it by saying thank you. We get to do this channel and work on many exciting things

76
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,280
because of you burps. This year our German channel reached a million subscribers. We launched our

77
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,200
Spanish one and released our first app. If everything goes well, we can finally start our

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,400
largest new project to date next year. But we know better than to promise too much. All of this works

79
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,720
because you support us directly. Thank you so much. We genuinely appreciate it. If you want to

80
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,600
help us out too and get something cool in return to the tune of nuking the moon, we've made a new

81
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,120
minimalistic infographic poster about the moon and how incredibly far away it is. Also there's

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,840
a baby duck, our cutest plushie yet, a new duck and friends enamel mug, our new ocean explorer

83
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,440
notebook, and so much more. All made with love and care. Let us know what you like and we'll make

84
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,240
more of it. Okay, let's wrap up this video and this year. Thank you again for watching and caring

85
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,600
and sharing. We hope that you slide peacefully into the year 12,021.

86
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:40,560
Let's all hope it will be a really boring year.
