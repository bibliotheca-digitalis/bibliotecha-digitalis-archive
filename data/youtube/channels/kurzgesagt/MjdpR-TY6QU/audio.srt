1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,000
Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
Getting old currently means spending more time in pain.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,360
So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,440
from optimizing lifespans to optimizing health spans,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,920
the part of our lives during which we're disease-free.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,160
To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects, aging itself.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress in the last few years,

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
with human trials about to begin in the near future.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:04,720
1. Senescent cells.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves, we have long segments of DNA

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
But they shrink with every cell division.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,840
In some cells, after a number of divisions, the telomeres are gone and the cell becomes a zombie,

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,320
a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
The older you get, the more of them there are inside you.

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,120
They harm tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age,

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,440
like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off?

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,240
Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active,

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,120
their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
Overall, they lived up to 30% longer and in better health than average mice.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Since we can't genetically engineer all of the cells in the human body,

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells?

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
But senescent cells don't. It turns out that they

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,120
underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
So, in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,400
It killed 80% of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,840
As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,520
involving senescent cells, and the first human trials will start soon.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,320
2. NAD+. Cells are made from hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures,

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,320
machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,360
As we age, this process becomes less effective, and so parts become crumpled, bunched up,

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,160
or are removed slower. Or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,400
One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells our cells to look after themselves.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,680
Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases,

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis.

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
But NAD+, can't enter cells, so we can't get it as a pill.

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
But scientists noticed that other, more flexible substances could enter cells,

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,240
and would then turn into NAD+, in sight.

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,320
In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin,

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,240
brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated,

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,640
had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan.

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,240
This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,000
astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
There are human trials being planned right now,

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,120
But NAD+, is a serious candidate, and could become the first human anti-aging pill.

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,920
Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body,

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,520
and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells.

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,280
But they decline as we age, and so we decline too.

61
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,640
Without new parts, human bodies break.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared,

63
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,480
they started to develop diseases. So they took stem cells from baby

64
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,120
mice brains, and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,920
More specifically, the hypothalamus, a part that's involved in regulating

66
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,160
a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,480
older brain cells by secreting microRNAs that regulated their metabolism.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,440
After four months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice,

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,200
and on average, they lived 10% longer. Another study took stem cells from mice

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,880
embryos, and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,720
As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer,

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
and weirdly enough, their hair regrew faster.

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:58,000
What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,120
It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap,

76
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,440
This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.

78
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent,

79
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,680
but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan,

80
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now,

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,480
attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain.

83
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,760
