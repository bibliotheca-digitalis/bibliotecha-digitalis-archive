800	6000	Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it.
6800	11840	We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this
11840	15920	is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick.
16800	20320	Getting old currently means spending more time in pain.
21280	25360	So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community
25360	29440	from optimizing lifespans to optimizing health spans,
29440	31920	the part of our lives during which we're disease-free.
33040	38160	To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects, aging itself.
39120	43920	Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress in the last few years,
43920	46480	with human trials about to begin in the near future.
47440	52640	Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now.
55360	64720	1. Senescent cells.
67040	73120	Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes.
73840	77680	Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends.
78400	83200	This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves, we have long segments of DNA
83200	87200	called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces.
87200	89280	But they shrink with every cell division.
90160	95840	In some cells, after a number of divisions, the telomeres are gone and the cell becomes a zombie,
95840	100320	a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die.
100960	103600	The older you get, the more of them there are inside you.
104320	109120	They harm tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age,
109120	113440	like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off?
114800	118240	Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their
118240	123280	senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active,
123280	127120	their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer.
127920	132400	Overall, they lived up to 30% longer and in better health than average mice.
133280	136800	Since we can't genetically engineer all of the cells in the human body,
136800	140160	we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells.
140160	142800	But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells?
143920	148560	Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged.
148560	151760	But senescent cells don't. It turns out that they
151760	155120	underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die.
156080	160720	So, in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein.
160720	166400	It killed 80% of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells.
167120	171280	The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair.
172240	175840	As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments
175840	179520	involving senescent cells, and the first human trials will start soon.
181200	188320	2. NAD+. Cells are made from hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures,
188320	192320	machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen.
193280	197120	All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt.
197680	203360	As we age, this process becomes less effective, and so parts become crumpled, bunched up,
203360	208160	or are removed slower. Or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need.
208960	214400	One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells our cells to look after themselves.
215280	220080	At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20.
220960	223680	Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases,
223680	228560	from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis.
229280	233200	But NAD+, can't enter cells, so we can't get it as a pill.
233840	237840	But scientists noticed that other, more flexible substances could enter cells,
237840	240240	and would then turn into NAD+, in sight.
241040	246320	In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin,
246320	250240	brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated,
250240	254640	had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan.
255520	260240	This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage
260240	264000	astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions.
264720	267120	There are human trials being planned right now,
267120	271040	but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan.
271680	277120	But NAD+, is a serious candidate, and could become the first human anti-aging pill.
281840	285920	Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body,
285920	289520	and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells.
290080	293280	But they decline as we age, and so we decline too.
294080	296640	Without new parts, human bodies break.
297600	302080	In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared,
302080	306480	they started to develop diseases. So they took stem cells from baby
306480	311120	mice brains, and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice.
311680	315920	More specifically, the hypothalamus, a part that's involved in regulating
315920	320160	a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated
320160	324480	older brain cells by secreting microRNAs that regulated their metabolism.
325200	329440	After four months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice,
329440	335200	and on average, they lived 10% longer. Another study took stem cells from mice
335200	338880	embryos, and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice.
339760	344720	As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer,
344720	347840	and weirdly enough, their hair regrew faster.
347840	358000	What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging.
358000	363120	It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells
363120	367120	to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap,
367120	370720	all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication.
370720	377440	This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice.
378080	382160	There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent,
382160	387680	but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan,
387680	393120	we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now,
393120	398160	and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more
398160	404480	attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain.
