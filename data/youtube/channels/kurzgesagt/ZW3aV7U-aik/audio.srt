1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Neutron stars are one of the most extreme things in the universe.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,600
They're like giant atom cores, kilometers in diameter, unbelievably dense and violent.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,800
But how can something like this even exist?

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,000
The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
its own gravity and the radiation pressure of its fusion reaction.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,200
In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Eventually, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,600
If the star is massive enough, helium is now fused into carbon.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions,

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,000
as heavier and heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Carbon is fused into neon, which leads to oxygen, which leads to silicon.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron, which cannot fuse into another element.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,200
When the fusion stops, the radiation pressure drops rapidly.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,400
The star is no longer in balance, and if its core mass exceeds about 1.4 solar masses,

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,200
a catastrophic collapse takes place.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,200
The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000 kilometers a second

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
as it collapses towards the center of the star.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Now, only the fundamental forces inside an atom are left to fight the gravitational collapse.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,400
The quantum mechanical repulsion of electrons is overcome,

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,800
and electrons and protons fuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,200
The outer layers of the star are catapulted into space in a violent supernova explosion.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,800
So, now we have a neutron star.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,600
Its mass is between one and three suns, but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide,

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,000
and 500,000 times the mass of Earth in this tiny ball that's roughly the diameter of Manhattan.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,400
It's so dense that one cubic centimeter of neutron star

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,800
contains the same mass as an iron cube 700 meters across.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
That's roughly one billion tons.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,600
As massive as Mount Everest, in a space the size of a sugar cube.

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Neutron star gravity is pretty impressive, too.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
If you were to drop an object from one meter over the surface,

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,400
it would hit the star in one microsecond and accelerate up to 7.2 million kilometers per hour.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
The surface is super flat, with irregularities of five millimeters maximum,

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
with a super thin atmosphere of hot plasma.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
The surface temperature is about one million Kelvin,

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,200
compared to 5,800 Kelvin for our Sun.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Let's look inside the neutron star.

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
The crust is extremely hard, and is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,800
with a sea of electrons flowing through them.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,000
The closer we get to the core, the more neutrons and fewer protons we see,

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,800
until there's just an incredibly dense soup of indistinguishable neutrons.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
The cores of neutron stars are very, very weird.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
We're not sure what their properties are,

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,200
but our closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter,

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
or some kind of ultra-dense quark matter, called quark gluon plasma,

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
that doesn't make any sense in the traditional way,

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,400
and can only exist in such an ultra-extreme environment.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
In many ways, a neutron star is similar to a giant atom core.

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
The most important difference is that atom cores are held together

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,800
by strong interaction, and neutron stars by gravity.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,000
As if all this wasn't extreme enough, let's take a look at a few other properties.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Neutron stars spin very, very fast.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Young ones, several times per second.

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
And if there's a poor star nearby to feed the neutron star,

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,800
it can rotate up to several hundred times per second.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Like the object PSR J1748-2446 AD.

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,400
It spins at approximately 252 million kilometers per hour.

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,000
This is so fast that the star has a rather strange shape.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,200
We call these objects pulsars because they emit a strong radio signal.

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,400
And the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly a trillion times stronger

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
than the magnetic field of Earth,

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
so strong that atoms get bent when they enter its influence.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, I think we got the point across.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Neutron stars are some of the most extreme,

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,400
but also some of the coolest objects in the universe.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Hopefully, we'll one day send spaceships to learn more about them

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
and take some neat pictures.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
But we shouldn't get too close.
