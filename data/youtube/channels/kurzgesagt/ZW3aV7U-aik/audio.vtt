00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Neutron stars are one of the most extreme things in the universe.

00:04.400 --> 00:10.600
They're like giant atom cores, kilometers in diameter, unbelievably dense and violent.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.800
But how can something like this even exist?

00:19.800 --> 00:24.000
The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
its own gravity and the radiation pressure of its fusion reaction.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.200
In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.800
Eventually, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.600
If the star is massive enough, helium is now fused into carbon.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.200
The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions,

00:45.200 --> 00:49.000
as heavier and heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Carbon is fused into neon, which leads to oxygen, which leads to silicon.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.200
Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron, which cannot fuse into another element.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.200
When the fusion stops, the radiation pressure drops rapidly.

01:03.200 --> 01:09.400
The star is no longer in balance, and if its core mass exceeds about 1.4 solar masses,

01:09.400 --> 01:12.200
a catastrophic collapse takes place.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.200
The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000 kilometers a second

01:17.200 --> 01:20.400
as it collapses towards the center of the star.

01:20.400 --> 01:26.800
Now, only the fundamental forces inside an atom are left to fight the gravitational collapse.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.400
The quantum mechanical repulsion of electrons is overcome,

01:30.400 --> 01:36.800
and electrons and protons fuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.200
The outer layers of the star are catapulted into space in a violent supernova explosion.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.800
So, now we have a neutron star.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.600
Its mass is between one and three suns, but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide,

01:53.600 --> 02:01.000
and 500,000 times the mass of Earth in this tiny ball that's roughly the diameter of Manhattan.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.400
It's so dense that one cubic centimeter of neutron star

02:05.400 --> 02:10.800
contains the same mass as an iron cube 700 meters across.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.400
That's roughly one billion tons.

02:13.400 --> 02:18.600
As massive as Mount Everest, in a space the size of a sugar cube.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.000
Neutron star gravity is pretty impressive, too.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.200
If you were to drop an object from one meter over the surface,

02:25.200 --> 02:32.400
it would hit the star in one microsecond and accelerate up to 7.2 million kilometers per hour.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.800
The surface is super flat, with irregularities of five millimeters maximum,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.400
with a super thin atmosphere of hot plasma.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.000
The surface temperature is about one million Kelvin,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.200
compared to 5,800 Kelvin for our Sun.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.400
Let's look inside the neutron star.

02:50.400 --> 02:55.400
The crust is extremely hard, and is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice

02:55.400 --> 02:57.800
with a sea of electrons flowing through them.

02:57.800 --> 03:02.000
The closer we get to the core, the more neutrons and fewer protons we see,

03:02.000 --> 03:06.800
until there's just an incredibly dense soup of indistinguishable neutrons.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.600
The cores of neutron stars are very, very weird.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.800
We're not sure what their properties are,

03:12.800 --> 03:17.200
but our closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter,

03:17.200 --> 03:22.400
or some kind of ultra-dense quark matter, called quark gluon plasma,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.800
that doesn't make any sense in the traditional way,

03:24.800 --> 03:29.400
and can only exist in such an ultra-extreme environment.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.400
In many ways, a neutron star is similar to a giant atom core.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.600
The most important difference is that atom cores are held together

03:36.600 --> 03:40.800
by strong interaction, and neutron stars by gravity.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.000
As if all this wasn't extreme enough, let's take a look at a few other properties.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Neutron stars spin very, very fast.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.400
Young ones, several times per second.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.600
And if there's a poor star nearby to feed the neutron star,

03:53.600 --> 03:56.800
it can rotate up to several hundred times per second.

03:56.800 --> 04:01.800
Like the object PSR J1748-2446 AD.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.400
It spins at approximately 252 million kilometers per hour.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.000
This is so fast that the star has a rather strange shape.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.200
We call these objects pulsars because they emit a strong radio signal.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.400
And the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly a trillion times stronger

04:20.400 --> 04:22.400
than the magnetic field of Earth,

04:22.400 --> 04:26.800
so strong that atoms get bent when they enter its influence.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.000
Okay, I think we got the point across.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.800
Neutron stars are some of the most extreme,

04:31.800 --> 04:35.400
but also some of the coolest objects in the universe.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.800
Hopefully, we'll one day send spaceships to learn more about them

04:38.800 --> 04:40.800
and take some neat pictures.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.800
But we shouldn't get too close.
