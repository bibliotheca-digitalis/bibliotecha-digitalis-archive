0	4400	Neutron stars are one of the most extreme things in the universe.
4400	10600	They're like giant atom cores, kilometers in diameter, unbelievably dense and violent.
10600	13800	But how can something like this even exist?
19800	24000	The life of a star is dominated by two forces being in balance,
24000	29000	its own gravity and the radiation pressure of its fusion reaction.
29000	33200	In the core of stars, hydrogen is fused into helium.
33200	36800	Eventually, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted.
36800	41600	If the star is massive enough, helium is now fused into carbon.
41600	45200	The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions,
45200	49000	as heavier and heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center.
49000	54000	Carbon is fused into neon, which leads to oxygen, which leads to silicon.
54000	59200	Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron, which cannot fuse into another element.
59200	63200	When the fusion stops, the radiation pressure drops rapidly.
63200	69400	The star is no longer in balance, and if its core mass exceeds about 1.4 solar masses,
69400	72200	a catastrophic collapse takes place.
72200	77200	The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000 kilometers a second
77200	80400	as it collapses towards the center of the star.
80400	86800	Now, only the fundamental forces inside an atom are left to fight the gravitational collapse.
86800	90400	The quantum mechanical repulsion of electrons is overcome,
90400	96800	and electrons and protons fuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus.
96800	103200	The outer layers of the star are catapulted into space in a violent supernova explosion.
103200	105800	So, now we have a neutron star.
105800	113600	Its mass is between one and three suns, but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide,
113600	121000	and 500,000 times the mass of Earth in this tiny ball that's roughly the diameter of Manhattan.
121000	125400	It's so dense that one cubic centimeter of neutron star
125400	130800	contains the same mass as an iron cube 700 meters across.
130800	133400	That's roughly one billion tons.
133400	138600	As massive as Mount Everest, in a space the size of a sugar cube.
138600	142000	Neutron star gravity is pretty impressive, too.
142000	145200	If you were to drop an object from one meter over the surface,
145200	152400	it would hit the star in one microsecond and accelerate up to 7.2 million kilometers per hour.
152400	156800	The surface is super flat, with irregularities of five millimeters maximum,
156800	160400	with a super thin atmosphere of hot plasma.
160400	164000	The surface temperature is about one million Kelvin,
164000	168200	compared to 5,800 Kelvin for our Sun.
168200	170400	Let's look inside the neutron star.
170400	175400	The crust is extremely hard, and is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice
175400	177800	with a sea of electrons flowing through them.
177800	182000	The closer we get to the core, the more neutrons and fewer protons we see,
182000	186800	until there's just an incredibly dense soup of indistinguishable neutrons.
186800	190600	The cores of neutron stars are very, very weird.
190600	192800	We're not sure what their properties are,
192800	197200	but our closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter,
197200	202400	or some kind of ultra-dense quark matter, called quark gluon plasma,
202400	204800	that doesn't make any sense in the traditional way,
204800	209400	and can only exist in such an ultra-extreme environment.
209400	213400	In many ways, a neutron star is similar to a giant atom core.
213400	216600	The most important difference is that atom cores are held together
216600	220800	by strong interaction, and neutron stars by gravity.
220800	225000	As if all this wasn't extreme enough, let's take a look at a few other properties.
225000	228000	Neutron stars spin very, very fast.
228000	230400	Young ones, several times per second.
230400	233600	And if there's a poor star nearby to feed the neutron star,
233600	236800	it can rotate up to several hundred times per second.
236800	241800	Like the object PSR J1748-2446 AD.
241800	247400	It spins at approximately 252 million kilometers per hour.
247400	252000	This is so fast that the star has a rather strange shape.
252000	256200	We call these objects pulsars because they emit a strong radio signal.
256200	260400	And the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly a trillion times stronger
260400	262400	than the magnetic field of Earth,
262400	266800	so strong that atoms get bent when they enter its influence.
266800	269000	Okay, I think we got the point across.
269000	271800	Neutron stars are some of the most extreme,
271800	275400	but also some of the coolest objects in the universe.
275400	278800	Hopefully, we'll one day send spaceships to learn more about them
278800	280800	and take some neat pictures.
280800	282800	But we shouldn't get too close.
