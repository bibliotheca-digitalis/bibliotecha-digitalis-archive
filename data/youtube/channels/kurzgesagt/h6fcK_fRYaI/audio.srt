1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable,

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,840
but fatal nonetheless. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you,

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,320
but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off, trust me.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,880
And that's when you met me. What happened? Where am I?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,800
You died, I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
There was... there was a truck. And it was skidding.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
Yes. I... I died.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,080
Yes. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies. You looked around.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,880
There was nothingness. Just you and me. What is this place?

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,240
Is this the afterlife? More or less. Are you God?

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,400
Yes. I'm God. My kids. My wife.

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,600
What about them? Will they be all right?

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,280
That's what I like to see, I said. You just died and your main concern is for your family.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
That's good stuff right there. You looked at me with fascination.

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,560
To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man or possibly a woman.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,320
Some vague authority figure, maybe. Don't worry, I said. They'll be fine.

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,520
Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
Your wife will cry on the outside but will be secretly relieved.

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640
To be fair, your marriage was falling apart.

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,320
If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,600
Oh, so what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:24,400
Neither. You'll be reincarnated. Ah, so the Hindus were right.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
All religions are right in their own way. Walk with me.

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,760
You followed along as we strode through the void.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Where are we going? Nowhere in particular. It's just nice to walk while we talk.

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:50,080
So what's the point then? When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby.

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,480
So all my experiences and everything, everything I did in this life, won't matter.

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,800
Not so. You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,480
You just don't remember them right now. I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,280
Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful and gigantic than you can possibly imagine.

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,240
A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are.

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,640
You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out,

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,840
you've gained all the experiences it had. You've been in a human for the last 48 years,

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,240
so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,160
But there's no point to doing that between each life.

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
How many times have I been reincarnated then?

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Oh, lots. Lots and lots. And into lots of different lives.

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,440
This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.

42
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,800
Wait, what? You're sending me back in time?

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,680
Well, I guess technically. Time as you know it only exists in your universe.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Things are different where I come from. Where… where you come from?

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Oh, sure. I come from somewhere, somewhere else. And there are others like me.

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
I know you'll want to know what it's like there, but honestly, you wouldn't understand.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:46,320
Oh, you said, a little let down. But wait, if I get reincarnated to other places in time,

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,120
I could have interacted with myself at some point. Sure, happens all the time.

49
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan, you don't even know it's happening.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
So what's the point of it all? I looked you in the eye.

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,640
The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,200
You mean mankind, you want us to mature?

53
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,400
No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life,

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.

55
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Just me? What about everyone else?

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,480
There is no one else. In this universe, there's just you and me.

57
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,200
You stared blankly at me. But all the people on Earth? All you, different incarnations of you.

58
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,320
Wait, I'm… everyone? Now you're getting it. I'm every human being who ever lived.

59
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,880
Or who will ever live? Yes, I'm Abraham Lincoln.

60
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,920
And you're John Wilkes Booth too. I'm Hitler, you said, appalled.

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,720
And you're the millions he killed. I'm Jesus. And you're everyone who followed him.

62
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,760
You fell silent. Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself.

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
Every act of kindness you've done, you've done to yourself.

64
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,480
Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you.

65
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,360
You thought for a long time. Why? Why do all this?

66
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,040
Because someday you will become like me. Because that's what you are.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,040
You're one of my kind. You're my child.

68
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,280
Wow, you said incredulous. You mean I'm a god?

69
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,040
No, not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing.

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,200
Once you've lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,200
So the whole universe, it's just... an egg, I answered.

72
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Now it's time for you to move on to your next life. And I sent you on your way.
