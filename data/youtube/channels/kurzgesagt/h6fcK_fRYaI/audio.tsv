0	10880	You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable,
10880	17840	but fatal nonetheless. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you,
17840	24320	but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off, trust me.
25280	30880	And that's when you met me. What happened? Where am I?
31840	36800	You died, I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.
37920	41360	There was... there was a truck. And it was skidding.
43120	46320	Yes. I... I died.
47600	54080	Yes. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies. You looked around.
55040	60880	There was nothingness. Just you and me. What is this place?
62480	68240	Is this the afterlife? More or less. Are you God?
69440	74400	Yes. I'm God. My kids. My wife.
76160	79600	What about them? Will they be all right?
79600	87280	That's what I like to see, I said. You just died and your main concern is for your family.
87280	92080	That's good stuff right there. You looked at me with fascination.
92720	98560	To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man or possibly a woman.
99360	106320	Some vague authority figure, maybe. Don't worry, I said. They'll be fine.
106320	109520	Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way.
110400	113200	They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you.
114000	118320	Your wife will cry on the outside but will be secretly relieved.
119840	122640	To be fair, your marriage was falling apart.
123440	128320	If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.
128320	135600	Oh, so what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?
136960	144400	Neither. You'll be reincarnated. Ah, so the Hindus were right.
145200	149200	All religions are right in their own way. Walk with me.
150960	153760	You followed along as we strode through the void.
153760	160640	Where are we going? Nowhere in particular. It's just nice to walk while we talk.
162240	170080	So what's the point then? When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby.
171360	176480	So all my experiences and everything, everything I did in this life, won't matter.
177440	184800	Not so. You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.
184800	190480	You just don't remember them right now. I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders.
191440	197280	Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful and gigantic than you can possibly imagine.
198320	202240	A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are.
203120	207440	It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold.
208160	212640	You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out,
213280	219840	you've gained all the experiences it had. You've been in a human for the last 48 years,
219840	224240	so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness.
225360	229760	If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything.
229760	232160	But there's no point to doing that between each life.
233920	236480	How many times have I been reincarnated then?
237680	242080	Oh, lots. Lots and lots. And into lots of different lives.
242720	247440	This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.
249040	252800	Wait, what? You're sending me back in time?
252800	259680	Well, I guess technically. Time as you know it only exists in your universe.
260400	265200	Things are different where I come from. Where… where you come from?
266320	271600	Oh, sure. I come from somewhere, somewhere else. And there are others like me.
272240	276560	I know you'll want to know what it's like there, but honestly, you wouldn't understand.
276560	286320	Oh, you said, a little let down. But wait, if I get reincarnated to other places in time,
286320	293120	I could have interacted with myself at some point. Sure, happens all the time.
293120	298720	And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan, you don't even know it's happening.
300160	304320	So what's the point of it all? I looked you in the eye.
305200	310640	The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.
312000	315200	You mean mankind, you want us to mature?
316880	322400	No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life,
322400	326240	you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.
328080	330800	Just me? What about everyone else?
331680	336480	There is no one else. In this universe, there's just you and me.
337680	345200	You stared blankly at me. But all the people on Earth? All you, different incarnations of you.
346400	354320	Wait, I'm… everyone? Now you're getting it. I'm every human being who ever lived.
354320	360880	Or who will ever live? Yes, I'm Abraham Lincoln.
362080	367920	And you're John Wilkes Booth too. I'm Hitler, you said, appalled.
368720	374720	And you're the millions he killed. I'm Jesus. And you're everyone who followed him.
375840	381760	You fell silent. Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself.
382720	386240	Every act of kindness you've done, you've done to yourself.
386960	394480	Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you.
395920	401360	You thought for a long time. Why? Why do all this?
402400	407040	Because someday you will become like me. Because that's what you are.
408000	411040	You're one of my kind. You're my child.
413200	417280	Wow, you said incredulous. You mean I'm a god?
418960	423040	No, not yet. You're a fetus. You're still growing.
423040	429200	Once you've lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.
429200	437200	So the whole universe, it's just... an egg, I answered.
438160	445360	Now it's time for you to move on to your next life. And I sent you on your way.
