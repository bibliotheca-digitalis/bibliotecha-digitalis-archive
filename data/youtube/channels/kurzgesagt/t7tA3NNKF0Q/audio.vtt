00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
A few days ago, Facebook proudly announced that they'd achieved 8 billion video views a day.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.800
That's really impressive, until you learn that in the first quarter of 2015,

00:09.800 --> 00:17.400
725 of the thousand most viewed videos on Facebook were stolen, amassing a total of 17 billion views.

00:18.100 --> 00:23.000
Sites and content aggregators steal videos from YouTube to go viral on Facebook.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.200
These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.900
They rig their algorithm so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links,

00:31.900 --> 00:37.300
because users should be kept as long as possible on the site, so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.600
This is, after all, their business model.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.600
But it also cheats when it comes to views.

00:42.700 --> 00:46.800
A view is counted after three seconds, even if the video is muted.

00:47.700 --> 00:52.900
Which means that because of autoplay, if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough, you count as a viewer.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.700
That means engagement is terrible.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.500
Compared to YouTube views, Facebook views plummet after a few seconds, because most views are not real.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.700
But large numbers are impressive, so Facebook keeps pretending.

01:06.500 --> 01:12.400
While this forced virality is weird, the real problem is the so-called freebooting, the stealing of videos.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.500
Since Facebook prefers its own player, stolen videos reach way more people than the original.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.700
Lately, this has happened to us more and more often.

01:20.800 --> 01:26.600
The most recent example amassed 3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in two days,

01:26.600 --> 01:31.100
while our own post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1,000 times.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.400
Other creators are hit even harder.

01:33.700 --> 01:39.000
SmarterEveryDay's videos get stolen constantly, getting viewed up to 17 million times.

01:39.300 --> 01:47.600
But even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson, a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his Facebook page.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.800
He adds a link to buy his music, too.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.400
He's not alone in this.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.400
A whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people's work.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.300
This is really bad for independent creators.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.400
Contrary to popular belief, stolen content gives creators close to no exposure at all.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.200
Only the thief and Facebook profit from this.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.100
Quality content takes a lot of creativity, time, and love.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.000
In our case, a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make.

02:16.700 --> 02:21.200
Even we, with more than a million subscribers, are dependent on the ads and exposure.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.200
Without ads and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.400
For a small creator, a viral video can mean the difference between a career and a hobby.

02:30.700 --> 02:36.400
On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen.

02:37.100 --> 02:42.400
Although the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.300
Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.200
But things are not fine.

02:50.700 --> 02:54.300
Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year.

02:54.700 --> 02:59.100
One, get an email or tweet from a fan that gives you a direct link to your video.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.400
It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.900
You depend on luck to find your stolen videos.

03:05.700 --> 03:11.000
Two, search for Facebook copyright infringement on Google, because it's actually faster this way.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.500
Three, fill out an annoyingly long contact form.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.300
Four, watch the views on your stolen videos rise.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.400
Five, Facebook finally pulls the video.

03:21.700 --> 03:26.200
Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.600
The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all.

03:30.300 --> 03:35.900
This is what successful creators have to deal with constantly, and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.400
it just feels like a violation to be treated like that.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.900
In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change,

03:42.200 --> 03:46.800
but it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down,

03:47.200 --> 03:49.900
and Facebook does not share the profits made from it.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.400
At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with.

03:55.200 --> 04:00.400
They've built their video empire on stolen content and disregard for original content creators.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.900
This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars.

04:05.700 --> 04:11.100
Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.100
which with the current state of play is troubling.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.600
Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies,

04:17.800 --> 04:22.900
but as creators, we don't feel like we're being asked or taken into consideration by the giant that is Facebook.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.600
What can you as a viewer do to help here?

04:25.900 --> 04:30.200
If you spot stolen content on Facebook, make a comment linking to the original content.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.300
Alert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.900
Share this video or the one done by Smarter every day.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.700
We all want the same thing, a free internet that's the basis for creativity, community, and great stuff.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.400
We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner, instead an obstacle to this goal.
