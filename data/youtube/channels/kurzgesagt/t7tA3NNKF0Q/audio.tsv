0	5000	A few days ago, Facebook proudly announced that they'd achieved 8 billion video views a day.
5500	9800	That's really impressive, until you learn that in the first quarter of 2015,
9800	17400	725 of the thousand most viewed videos on Facebook were stolen, amassing a total of 17 billion views.
18100	23000	Sites and content aggregators steal videos from YouTube to go viral on Facebook.
23200	26200	These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating.
27100	31900	They rig their algorithm so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links,
31900	37300	because users should be kept as long as possible on the site, so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible.
37600	39600	This is, after all, their business model.
40400	42600	But it also cheats when it comes to views.
42700	46800	A view is counted after three seconds, even if the video is muted.
47700	52900	Which means that because of autoplay, if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough, you count as a viewer.
53600	55700	That means engagement is terrible.
56000	61500	Compared to YouTube views, Facebook views plummet after a few seconds, because most views are not real.
62200	65700	But large numbers are impressive, so Facebook keeps pretending.
66500	72400	While this forced virality is weird, the real problem is the so-called freebooting, the stealing of videos.
73000	77500	Since Facebook prefers its own player, stolen videos reach way more people than the original.
78400	80700	Lately, this has happened to us more and more often.
80800	86600	The most recent example amassed 3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in two days,
86600	91100	while our own post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1,000 times.
91500	93400	Other creators are hit even harder.
93700	99000	SmarterEveryDay's videos get stolen constantly, getting viewed up to 17 million times.
99300	107600	But even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson, a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his Facebook page.
107900	109800	He adds a link to buy his music, too.
110300	111400	He's not alone in this.
111500	115400	A whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people's work.
116500	119300	This is really bad for independent creators.
119700	124400	Contrary to popular belief, stolen content gives creators close to no exposure at all.
124800	127200	Only the thief and Facebook profit from this.
128100	132100	Quality content takes a lot of creativity, time, and love.
132400	136000	In our case, a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make.
136700	141200	Even we, with more than a million subscribers, are dependent on the ads and exposure.
141400	145200	Without ads and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos.
146200	150400	For a small creator, a viral video can mean the difference between a career and a hobby.
150700	156400	On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen.
157100	162400	Although the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers.
163000	168300	Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other.
169000	170200	But things are not fine.
170700	174300	Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year.
174700	179100	One, get an email or tweet from a fan that gives you a direct link to your video.
179700	182400	It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself.
182600	184900	You depend on luck to find your stolen videos.
185700	191000	Two, search for Facebook copyright infringement on Google, because it's actually faster this way.
191800	194500	Three, fill out an annoyingly long contact form.
195300	198300	Four, watch the views on your stolen videos rise.
199000	201400	Five, Facebook finally pulls the video.
201700	206200	Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get.
206700	209600	The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all.
210300	215900	This is what successful creators have to deal with constantly, and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money,
216000	218400	it just feels like a violation to be treated like that.
219100	221900	In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change,
222200	226800	but it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down,
227200	229900	and Facebook does not share the profits made from it.
230200	234400	At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with.
235200	240400	They've built their video empire on stolen content and disregard for original content creators.
240700	244900	This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars.
245700	251100	Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue,
252000	254100	which with the current state of play is troubling.
254500	257600	Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies,
257800	262900	but as creators, we don't feel like we're being asked or taken into consideration by the giant that is Facebook.
263500	265600	What can you as a viewer do to help here?
265900	270200	If you spot stolen content on Facebook, make a comment linking to the original content.
270400	274300	Alert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report.
274800	277900	Share this video or the one done by Smarter every day.
278400	283700	We all want the same thing, a free internet that's the basis for creativity, community, and great stuff.
284000	288400	We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner, instead an obstacle to this goal.
