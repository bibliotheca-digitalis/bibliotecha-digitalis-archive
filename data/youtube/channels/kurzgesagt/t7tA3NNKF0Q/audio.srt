00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A few days ago, Facebook proudly announced that they'd achieved 8 billion video views a day.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,800
That's really impressive, until you learn that in the first quarter of 2015,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,400
725 of the thousand most viewed videos on Facebook were stolen, amassing a total of 17 billion views.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Sites and content aggregators steal videos from YouTube to go viral on Facebook.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,200
These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,900
They rig their algorithm so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links,

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,300
because users should be kept as long as possible on the site, so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
This is, after all, their business model.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,600
But it also cheats when it comes to views.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,800
A view is counted after three seconds, even if the video is muted.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,900
Which means that because of autoplay, if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough, you count as a viewer.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,700
That means engagement is terrible.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Compared to YouTube views, Facebook views plummet after a few seconds, because most views are not real.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,700
But large numbers are impressive, so Facebook keeps pretending.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,400
While this forced virality is weird, the real problem is the so-called freebooting, the stealing of videos.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Since Facebook prefers its own player, stolen videos reach way more people than the original.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,700
Lately, this has happened to us more and more often.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,600
The most recent example amassed 3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in two days,

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,100
while our own post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1,000 times.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,400
Other creators are hit even harder.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,000
SmarterEveryDay's videos get stolen constantly, getting viewed up to 17 million times.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:47,600
But even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson, a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his Facebook page.

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,800
He adds a link to buy his music, too.

24
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,400
He's not alone in this.

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,400
A whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people's work.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,300
This is really bad for independent creators.

27
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,400
Contrary to popular belief, stolen content gives creators close to no exposure at all.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
Only the thief and Facebook profit from this.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Quality content takes a lot of creativity, time, and love.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
In our case, a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make.

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Even we, with more than a million subscribers, are dependent on the ads and exposure.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Without ads and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,400
For a small creator, a viral video can mean the difference between a career and a hobby.

34
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,400
On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,400
Although the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
But things are not fine.

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year.

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,100
One, get an email or tweet from a fan that gives you a direct link to your video.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,400
It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself.

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,900
You depend on luck to find your stolen videos.

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,000
Two, search for Facebook copyright infringement on Google, because it's actually faster this way.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,500
Three, fill out an annoyingly long contact form.

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Four, watch the views on your stolen videos rise.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Five, Facebook finally pulls the video.

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,200
Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,600
The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,900
This is what successful creators have to deal with constantly, and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money,

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
it just feels like a violation to be treated like that.

50
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,900
In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change,

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,800
but it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down,

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,900
and Facebook does not share the profits made from it.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,400
At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with.

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,400
They've built their video empire on stolen content and disregard for original content creators.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,900
This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars.

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,100
Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue,

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
which with the current state of play is troubling.

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,600
Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies,

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,900
but as creators, we don't feel like we're being asked or taken into consideration by the giant that is Facebook.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,600
What can you as a viewer do to help here?

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,200
If you spot stolen content on Facebook, make a comment linking to the original content.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,300
Alert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,900
Share this video or the one done by Smarter every day.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,700
We all want the same thing, a free internet that's the basis for creativity, community, and great stuff.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,400
We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner, instead an obstacle to this goal.

66
