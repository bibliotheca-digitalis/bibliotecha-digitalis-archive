00:00.000 --> 00:11.640
In and out. In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are

00:11.640 --> 00:18.160
combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another

00:18.160 --> 00:25.800
precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very

00:25.880 --> 00:32.440
hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to

00:32.440 --> 00:38.240
the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem, and the solution is

00:38.240 --> 00:45.960
surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've

00:45.960 --> 00:50.960
discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different

00:50.960 --> 00:57.080
consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension

00:57.080 --> 01:03.400
might not matter to you or be a deadly danger, depending on how big you are. Living things need

01:03.400 --> 01:08.400
a lot of different materials to keep themselves going, and they somehow need to transport them

01:08.400 --> 01:14.440
from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being

01:14.440 --> 01:20.560
alive, because doing anything in our universe requires energy, and the first living beings on

01:20.560 --> 01:26.240
Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after

01:26.240 --> 01:32.920
billions of years of evolution. So at the very beginning, life needed to find a way to get good

01:32.920 --> 01:39.440
stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first

01:39.440 --> 01:46.240
forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free

01:46.240 --> 01:53.240
form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of

01:53.240 --> 01:59.680
the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all

01:59.680 --> 02:05.920
directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to

02:05.920 --> 02:12.280
spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place,

02:12.320 --> 02:18.760
and in another place, there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start

02:18.760 --> 02:24.880
randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar

02:24.880 --> 02:31.680
molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements

02:31.680 --> 02:38.480
continue endlessly until at some point, the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing

02:38.480 --> 02:45.800
about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy. And life loves free

02:45.800 --> 02:53.520
things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth,

02:53.520 --> 03:01.600
a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.

03:01.640 --> 03:09.040
This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste

03:09.040 --> 03:16.920
product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because

03:16.920 --> 03:22.540
of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, so the carbon dioxide diffuses

03:22.540 --> 03:29.840
out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works

03:29.960 --> 03:37.800
for the very small world, for bacteria, amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals. Insects,

03:37.800 --> 03:42.920
for example, have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very

03:42.920 --> 03:49.640
slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to

03:49.640 --> 03:54.840
contract their trachea, and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles

03:54.880 --> 04:03.680
and air sacs. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental

04:03.680 --> 04:09.360
problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface, and diffusion of

04:09.360 --> 04:17.760
materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit

04:17.760 --> 04:25.520
of inside or volume, and a lot of outside or surface area. But what if we wanted to create

04:25.520 --> 04:33.240
a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be

04:33.240 --> 04:38.680
messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something 10 times

04:38.680 --> 04:47.560
larger, its outside or surface would grow by 100, but its insides or volume grows by 1000 times.

04:47.560 --> 04:54.920
If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has

04:54.920 --> 05:01.880
10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of

05:01.880 --> 05:07.840
outsides, while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale,

05:07.840 --> 05:14.440
our giant bacteria now has too much insides, and most of its inside is now very far from its

05:14.440 --> 05:20.640
surface. The oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out

05:20.640 --> 05:29.840
of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides. From making

05:29.840 --> 05:36.680
it harder to be eaten, to making it easier to eat others. But the size of cells is limited by the

05:36.680 --> 05:42.040
distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough

05:42.040 --> 05:50.520
resources. So life avoided this problem by forming multicellular structures. Beings composed of many

05:50.520 --> 05:57.360
cells instead of one, because diffusion works better if you have many small units instead of

05:57.360 --> 06:05.440
one much bigger one. Over time, the cell buddies began to share work and specialize. Some cells

06:05.520 --> 06:12.520
concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on movement. But that still

06:12.520 --> 06:18.480
wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained, limiting

06:18.480 --> 06:24.920
the size these first multicellular forms of life could attain. So in order to become even bigger,

06:24.920 --> 06:31.760
life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself,

06:31.840 --> 06:38.840
so diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells. Take yourself. What you consider your

06:38.840 --> 06:45.680
outside, your skin, has a surface area of about two square meters. But your lungs have a surface

06:45.680 --> 06:52.200
area of about 70 square meters. They aren't like balloons. They're more like sponges filled with

06:52.200 --> 06:59.000
many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny

06:59.120 --> 07:05.920
balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up with CO2 is pumped around the balloons. And then,

07:05.920 --> 07:13.040
the magic of diffusion happens. The oxygen diffuses into the blood where it's picked up by red blood

07:13.040 --> 07:19.520
cells. And the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs where it can be breathed out again.

07:19.520 --> 07:26.300
Your blood then carries oxygen rich blood into the furthest corners of your body and picks up

07:26.300 --> 07:33.500
the CO2 waste. Diffusion in the body is effective at about one millimeter. So every cell in your

07:33.500 --> 07:40.700
body is at most one millimeter away from a blood vessel. So medium sized animals like you need a

07:40.700 --> 07:47.740
lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body. Your body has around 100,000 kilometers of

07:47.740 --> 07:54.180
capillaries alone, the tiniest of your blood vessels with a surface area of around 1000 square

07:54.180 --> 07:59.940
meters. This is true for all parts of you that want to exchange something with the outside world.

07:59.940 --> 08:06.620
Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your food. So your gut has the surface area of half

08:06.620 --> 08:13.060
a badminton court, roughly 40 square meters. The larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need.

08:13.060 --> 08:20.340
Take a tree. Its way to stay alive is to create sugar out of thin air and sunlight. So it needs

08:20.340 --> 08:27.740
as much surface area as possible. An orange tree with 2000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200

08:27.740 --> 08:34.860
square meters. But the surface inside the leaves where diffusion actually occurs is 6000 square

08:34.860 --> 08:40.540
meters. The same with roots where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs that

08:40.540 --> 08:48.540
maximize the surface area. The roots of one square meter of grass add up to around 350 square meters

08:48.540 --> 08:55.220
of surface. If we look at the breathtaking diversity of life on this planet, it seems like

08:55.220 --> 09:02.820
everything is pretty different. And it is. But some basic principles are the same for everybody

09:02.820 --> 09:10.300
and have not changed significantly for billions of years. If we look at the very, very small or the

09:10.300 --> 09:18.460
very, very big waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in. Big animals just need a lot of complex

09:18.460 --> 09:24.460
plumbing to make it possible. Fresh fuel is something we can all use from time to time,

09:24.460 --> 09:30.700
especially for our creativity. All it really takes is to try something new. And we have the

09:30.700 --> 09:35.660
perfect opportunity to get you started. We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning

09:35.740 --> 09:40.540
community that offers courses on almost any creative skill, such as design, illustration,

09:40.540 --> 09:46.620
animation, photography, and cooking. They have 1000s of courses starting from every level. So

09:46.620 --> 09:51.660
wherever you are right now, there'll be something for you. Maybe you want to look behind the scenes

09:51.660 --> 09:56.260
of our animations. For example, we've made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how

09:56.260 --> 10:01.500
we animated scenes from our videos with video lessons, classes, and hands on projects. Or if

10:01.500 --> 10:06.220
you'd rather look into illustration first, we recommend Adobe Illustrator, level up your colors

10:06.220 --> 10:11.700
by Hayden Obey. But what you pick first doesn't really matter that much. The important part is to

10:11.700 --> 10:18.300
get started, have some fun and get new inspiration. Unlimited access to all classes is only $10 a
