1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,640
In and out. In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,160
combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,800
precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,440
hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,240
the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem, and the solution is

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,960
surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,080
consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,400
might not matter to you or be a deadly danger, depending on how big you are. Living things need

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,400
a lot of different materials to keep themselves going, and they somehow need to transport them

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,440
from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,560
alive, because doing anything in our universe requires energy, and the first living beings on

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,920
billions of years of evolution. So at the very beginning, life needed to find a way to get good

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,440
stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,240
forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,240
form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,680
the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,920
directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,280
spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place,

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,760
and in another place, there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,880
randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,680
molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,480
continue endlessly until at some point, the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,800
about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy. And life loves free

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,520
things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth,

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,600
a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:09,040
This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,920
product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,540
of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, so the carbon dioxide diffuses

31
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,840
out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works

32
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,800
for the very small world, for bacteria, amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals. Insects,

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,920
for example, have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very

34
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,640
slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to

35
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,840
contract their trachea, and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:03,680
and air sacs. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface, and diffusion of

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,760
materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,520
of inside or volume, and a lot of outside or surface area. But what if we wanted to create

40
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,240
a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be

41
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,680
messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something 10 times

42
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:47,560
larger, its outside or surface would grow by 100, but its insides or volume grows by 1000 times.

43
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,920
If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has

44
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,880
10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of

45
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,840
outsides, while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale,

46
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,440
our giant bacteria now has too much insides, and most of its inside is now very far from its

47
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,640
surface. The oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out

48
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:29,840
of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides. From making

49
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,680
it harder to be eaten, to making it easier to eat others. But the size of cells is limited by the

50
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,040
distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough

51
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,520
resources. So life avoided this problem by forming multicellular structures. Beings composed of many

52
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,360
cells instead of one, because diffusion works better if you have many small units instead of

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,440
one much bigger one. Over time, the cell buddies began to share work and specialize. Some cells

54
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,520
concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on movement. But that still

55
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,480
wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained, limiting

56
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,920
the size these first multicellular forms of life could attain. So in order to become even bigger,

57
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,760
life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself,

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,840
so diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells. Take yourself. What you consider your

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,680
outside, your skin, has a surface area of about two square meters. But your lungs have a surface

60
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,200
area of about 70 square meters. They aren't like balloons. They're more like sponges filled with

61
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:59,000
many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny

62
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,920
balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up with CO2 is pumped around the balloons. And then,

63
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:13,040
the magic of diffusion happens. The oxygen diffuses into the blood where it's picked up by red blood

64
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,520
cells. And the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs where it can be breathed out again.

65
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,300
Your blood then carries oxygen rich blood into the furthest corners of your body and picks up

66
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,500
the CO2 waste. Diffusion in the body is effective at about one millimeter. So every cell in your

67
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,700
body is at most one millimeter away from a blood vessel. So medium sized animals like you need a

68
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,740
lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body. Your body has around 100,000 kilometers of

69
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,180
capillaries alone, the tiniest of your blood vessels with a surface area of around 1000 square

70
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,940
meters. This is true for all parts of you that want to exchange something with the outside world.

71
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,620
Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your food. So your gut has the surface area of half

72
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,060
a badminton court, roughly 40 square meters. The larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need.

73
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:20,340
Take a tree. Its way to stay alive is to create sugar out of thin air and sunlight. So it needs

74
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,740
as much surface area as possible. An orange tree with 2000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200

75
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,860
square meters. But the surface inside the leaves where diffusion actually occurs is 6000 square

76
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,540
meters. The same with roots where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs that

77
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:48,540
maximize the surface area. The roots of one square meter of grass add up to around 350 square meters

78
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:55,220
of surface. If we look at the breathtaking diversity of life on this planet, it seems like

79
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,820
everything is pretty different. And it is. But some basic principles are the same for everybody

80
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,300
and have not changed significantly for billions of years. If we look at the very, very small or the

81
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:18,460
very, very big waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in. Big animals just need a lot of complex

82
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,460
plumbing to make it possible. Fresh fuel is something we can all use from time to time,

83
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,700
especially for our creativity. All it really takes is to try something new. And we have the

84
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,660
perfect opportunity to get you started. We partnered with Skillshare, an online learning

85
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,540
community that offers courses on almost any creative skill, such as design, illustration,

86
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,620
animation, photography, and cooking. They have 1000s of courses starting from every level. So

87
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,660
wherever you are right now, there'll be something for you. Maybe you want to look behind the scenes

88
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,260
of our animations. For example, we've made a couple of Skillshare classes that teach you how

89
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,500
we animated scenes from our videos with video lessons, classes, and hands on projects. Or if

90
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,220
you'd rather look into illustration first, we recommend Adobe Illustrator, level up your colors

91
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,700
by Hayden Obey. But what you pick first doesn't really matter that much. The important part is to

92
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,300
get started, have some fun and get new inspiration. Unlimited access to all classes is only $10 a

93
