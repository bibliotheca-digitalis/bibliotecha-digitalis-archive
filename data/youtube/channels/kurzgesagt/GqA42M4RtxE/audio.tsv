0	5680	Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.
5680	7680	One of them is the honeybee.
7680	12400	One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.
12400	16160	They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,
16160	18000	thousands of plants would follow,
18000	21600	which could lead to millions of people starving in the following years.
21600	24960	On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact.
24960	30480	The dollar value of plants pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion.
30480	33520	Food we take for granted would just stop existing without them,
33520	36480	or there would be a massive decrease in productivity.
36480	40800	Food including apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock
40800	43680	are thus extremely important for our milk and meat.
43680	45840	Einstein is often quoted as having said,
45840	50080	if honeybees die out, humans will follow a few years later.
50080	54320	Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth in the statement.
54400	58240	It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear.
58240	61280	Millions of hives have died in the last few years.
61280	67440	Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30-90% of their colonists.
67440	70640	In the US alone, bees are steadily declining,
70640	75120	from 5 million hives in 1988 to 2.5 million today.
75120	79440	Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder
79440	82000	has affected honeybees in many countries,
82000	84800	and we're not entirely sure what's causing it.
84800	87280	All we know is that it's pretty serious.
94240	98960	Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very dangerous foes.
98960	103120	Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody.
103120	108400	Microscopic mites that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees.
108400	112000	Here, they lay their eggs and feed from the fluids of their victims,
112000	116400	weakening them considerably and spending their whole life inside the bees.
116400	121760	Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee hives
121760	124240	and are one of the bees' greatest enemies.
124240	128800	The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and lays eggs on the bee larva
128800	133600	before it's about to pupate and before the hivebees cover the cell with a wax capping.
133600	136480	The eggs hatch, and the young mites and their mother
136480	139760	feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell.
139760	142960	The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,
142960	146240	so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping
146240	148000	and release itself from the cell.
148000	152160	As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell,
152160	154400	and these are free to spread across the hive,
154400	158240	starting the process over again in a cycle of about ten days.
158240	160240	Their numbers grow exponentially,
160240	164560	and after a few months this can lead to the collapse of the entire bee hive.
164560	169200	Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees
169200	171040	and weaken them considerably.
171040	175520	To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees even more
175520	178640	and can lead to birth defects like useless wings.
178640	182800	But there are other threats too, such as viruses and fungi.
182800	186400	Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be manageable
186400	191120	and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.
191120	196160	Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.
196160	199680	Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine,
199680	204560	was approved in the early 1990s as an alternative to chemicals like DDT.
204560	207520	They attack insects by harming their nervous systems.
207520	211520	Today, they are the most widely used insecticides in the world.
211520	215600	Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2008,
215600	219520	representing 24% of the global market for insecticides.
219520	226400	In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops
226400	231840	and also on the vast majority of fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches,
231840	236080	oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes,
236080	240320	cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more.
240320	245520	Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or via contaminated water,
245520	250880	often bringing material into the hive where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony.
250880	254720	The toxins harm bees in a variety of horrible ways.
254720	259360	In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death.
259360	261680	But even in small doses, it can be fatal.
261680	264880	It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,
264880	270240	so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives.
270240	274880	If this happens often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself.
274880	280560	We know that neonicotinoids are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it.
280560	284480	But there are billions of dollars to be made in delaying this.
284480	289360	Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity
289360	293040	to bees compared to those produced by independent scientists.
293040	296480	There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees,
296480	301840	like too much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,
301840	305440	stress because of human activities, and other pesticides.
305440	308640	Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for bees,
308640	312800	but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder.
312800	318400	With parasites upping their game in recent decades, the honeybees are now fighting for survival.
318400	321600	It would be a catastrophe if they lost this fight.
321600	324080	This is a conundrum we have to solve
324080	329040	if we want to continue living with a relative abundance and diversity of food.
329040	333760	Humanity is deeply interconnected with Earth and the other life forms on it.
333760	338240	Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better care of our surroundings,
338240	342480	if not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own survival.
