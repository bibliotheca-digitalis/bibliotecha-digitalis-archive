1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,680
One of them is the honeybee.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
thousands of plants would follow,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
which could lead to millions of people starving in the following years.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,480
The dollar value of plants pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
Food we take for granted would just stop existing without them,

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
or there would be a massive decrease in productivity.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,800
Food including apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
are thus extremely important for our milk and meat.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
Einstein is often quoted as having said,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,080
if honeybees die out, humans will follow a few years later.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,320
Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth in the statement.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,240
It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
Millions of hives have died in the last few years.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,440
Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30-90% of their colonists.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,640
In the US alone, bees are steadily declining,

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,120
from 5 million hives in 1988 to 2.5 million today.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,440
Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,000
has affected honeybees in many countries,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,800
and we're not entirely sure what's causing it.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,280
All we know is that it's pretty serious.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very dangerous foes.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,120
Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,400
Microscopic mites that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees.

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Here, they lay their eggs and feed from the fluids of their victims,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,400
weakening them considerably and spending their whole life inside the bees.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,760
Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee hives

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,240
and are one of the bees' greatest enemies.

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,800
The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and lays eggs on the bee larva

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,600
before it's about to pupate and before the hivebees cover the cell with a wax capping.

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,480
The eggs hatch, and the young mites and their mother

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,760
feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,960
The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,240
so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,000
and release itself from the cell.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell,

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
and these are free to spread across the hive,

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,240
starting the process over again in a cycle of about ten days.

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Their numbers grow exponentially,

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,560
and after a few months this can lead to the collapse of the entire bee hive.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,200
Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
and weaken them considerably.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,520
To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees even more

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,640
and can lead to birth defects like useless wings.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,800
But there are other threats too, such as viruses and fungi.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be manageable

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,680
Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine,

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
was approved in the early 1990s as an alternative to chemicals like DDT.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,520
They attack insects by harming their nervous systems.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Today, they are the most widely used insecticides in the world.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2008,

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,520
representing 24% of the global market for insecticides.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,400
In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
and also on the vast majority of fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches,

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes,

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,320
cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or via contaminated water,

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,880
often bringing material into the hive where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
The toxins harm bees in a variety of horrible ways.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,360
In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,680
But even in small doses, it can be fatal.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,240
so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives.

69
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,880
If this happens often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself.

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,560
We know that neonicotinoids are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,480
But there are billions of dollars to be made in delaying this.

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity

73
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
to bees compared to those produced by independent scientists.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,480
There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees,

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,840
like too much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,

76
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
stress because of human activities, and other pesticides.

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for bees,

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,800
but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
With parasites upping their game in recent decades, the honeybees are now fighting for survival.

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,600
It would be a catastrophe if they lost this fight.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,080
This is a conundrum we have to solve

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,040
if we want to continue living with a relative abundance and diversity of food.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,760
Humanity is deeply interconnected with Earth and the other life forms on it.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,240
Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better care of our surroundings,

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,480
if not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own survival.
