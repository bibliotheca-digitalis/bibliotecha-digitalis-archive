00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Human society is extremely complex and fragile, built upon various pillars.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.680
One of them is the honeybee.

00:07.680 --> 00:12.400
One out of three meals eaten by humans is made possible by honeybees.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.160
They are so important that if all the honeybees were to die out,

00:16.160 --> 00:18.000
thousands of plants would follow,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.600
which could lead to millions of people starving in the following years.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.960
On top of that, honeybees have a huge economic impact.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.480
The dollar value of plants pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.520
Food we take for granted would just stop existing without them,

00:33.520 --> 00:36.480
or there would be a massive decrease in productivity.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.800
Food including apples, onions, pumpkins, and also plants used for feeding livestock

00:40.800 --> 00:43.680
are thus extremely important for our milk and meat.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.840
Einstein is often quoted as having said,

00:45.840 --> 00:50.080
if honeybees die out, humans will follow a few years later.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.320
Actually, he probably didn't say that, but there might be some truth in the statement.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.240
It's unsettling, but honeybees have started to disappear.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.280
Millions of hives have died in the last few years.

01:01.280 --> 01:07.440
Beekeepers all over the world have seen an annual loss of 30-90% of their colonists.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.640
In the US alone, bees are steadily declining,

01:10.640 --> 01:15.120
from 5 million hives in 1988 to 2.5 million today.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.440
Since 2006, a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder

01:19.440 --> 01:22.000
has affected honeybees in many countries,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.800
and we're not entirely sure what's causing it.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.280
All we know is that it's pretty serious.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.960
Over the last few decades, bees have seen an invasion of very dangerous foes.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.120
Parasites straight out of a horror movie, like a carapace woody.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.400
Microscopic mites that infect the trachea, that's the breathing tubes, of bees.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.000
Here, they lay their eggs and feed from the fluids of their victims,

01:52.000 --> 01:56.400
weakening them considerably and spending their whole life inside the bees.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.760
Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name because they can only reproduce in honeybee hives

02:01.760 --> 02:04.240
and are one of the bees' greatest enemies.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.800
The female mite enters a honeybee brood cell and lays eggs on the bee larva

02:08.800 --> 02:13.600
before it's about to pupate and before the hivebees cover the cell with a wax capping.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.480
The eggs hatch, and the young mites and their mother

02:16.480 --> 02:19.760
feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.960
The bee is not normally killed at this stage, just weakened,

02:22.960 --> 02:26.240
so it still has enough strength to chew its way through the wax capping

02:26.240 --> 02:28.000
and release itself from the cell.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.160
As it does, it releases the mother mite and her new offspring from the cell,

02:32.160 --> 02:34.400
and these are free to spread across the hive,

02:34.400 --> 02:38.240
starting the process over again in a cycle of about ten days.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.240
Their numbers grow exponentially,

02:40.240 --> 02:44.560
and after a few months this can lead to the collapse of the entire bee hive.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.200
Once outside of the cell, adult mites also suck the bodily fluids of bees

02:49.200 --> 02:51.040
and weaken them considerably.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.520
To make things worse, they also transmit viruses that harm the bees even more

02:55.520 --> 02:58.640
and can lead to birth defects like useless wings.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.800
But there are other threats too, such as viruses and fungi.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.400
Under normal circumstances, these phenomena should be manageable

03:06.400 --> 03:11.120
and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of dying going on in bees.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.160
Over recent years, new insecticides have been introduced that are deadly to bees.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.680
Neonicotinoids, a chemical family similar to nicotine,

03:19.680 --> 03:24.560
was approved in the early 1990s as an alternative to chemicals like DDT.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.520
They attack insects by harming their nervous systems.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.520
Today, they are the most widely used insecticides in the world.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.600
Globally, they saw sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2008,

03:35.600 --> 03:39.520
representing 24% of the global market for insecticides.

03:39.520 --> 03:46.400
In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the US on about 95% of corn and canola crops

03:46.400 --> 03:51.840
and also on the vast majority of fruit and vegetables like apples, cherries, peaches,

03:51.840 --> 03:56.080
oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes,

03:56.080 --> 04:00.320
cereal grains, rice, nuts, grapes, and many more.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.520
Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or via contaminated water,

04:05.520 --> 04:10.880
often bringing material into the hive where it can accumulate and slowly kill the whole colony.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.720
The toxins harm bees in a variety of horrible ways.

04:14.720 --> 04:19.360
In high enough doses, it quickly leads to convulsions, paralysis, and death.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.680
But even in small doses, it can be fatal.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.880
It may lead to bees forgetting how to navigate the world,

04:24.880 --> 04:30.240
so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and die alone, separated from their hives.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.880
If this happens often enough, a hive can lose its ability to sustain itself.

04:34.880 --> 04:40.560
We know that neonicotinoids are harmful to bees and that we urgently need an alternative to it.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.480
But there are billions of dollars to be made in delaying this.

04:44.480 --> 04:49.360
Studies sponsored by the chemical industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity

04:49.360 --> 04:53.040
to bees compared to those produced by independent scientists.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.480
There are even more factors contributing to the demise of bees,

04:56.480 --> 05:01.840
like too much genetic uniformity, crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,

05:01.840 --> 05:05.440
stress because of human activities, and other pesticides.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.640
Each of those factors on its own is a major problem for bees,

05:08.640 --> 05:12.800
but together, they probably account for colony collapse disorder.

05:12.800 --> 05:18.400
With parasites upping their game in recent decades, the honeybees are now fighting for survival.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.600
It would be a catastrophe if they lost this fight.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.080
This is a conundrum we have to solve

05:24.080 --> 05:29.040
if we want to continue living with a relative abundance and diversity of food.

05:29.040 --> 05:33.760
Humanity is deeply interconnected with Earth and the other life forms on it.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.240
Even if we pretend that we're not, we have to take better care of our surroundings,

05:38.240 --> 05:42.480
if not to preserve the beauty of nature, then at least to ensure our own survival.
