00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural powers,

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
creating horribly toxic elements that, if they escape, can and have killed people in horrible ways.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
How many people has nuclear energy killed, and how?

00:20.000 --> 00:35.000
Nuclear energy has been a thing since 1951, and since then, there have been around 30 reported accidents globally.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with, Fukushima and Chernobyl.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
The reactor technology was old and ill-prepared for emergencies, and the government response was slow and more concerned about image than damage control.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Still, only 31 people died directly in the accident.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
But what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up, but the radiation they release.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
So the real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will Chernobyl cause?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Here, things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
and just discussing the different estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own.

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
The most pessimistic estimate comes from a study commissioned by the European Green Party and projects up to 60,000 premature deaths by the year 2065.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
The WHO has estimated that in total, the long-term death toll will be around 4,000,

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
while the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
For more details on this, check our research document.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
The second big nuclear accident was Fukushima Daiichi in 2011.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Fukushima did not only operate with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place,

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
much better security measures were in place, and the official response was fast and decisive.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
And so the current death toll is only 573.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
The major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
They were indirect deaths from the stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
and occurred almost entirely in older populations.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary widely, from none at all to about 1,000.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
In terms of the other long-term consequences, an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
but according to the WHO, this is related to the increased screening rate.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
By 2018, there had been only one confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation-induced lung cancer.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Now, let's compare this to renewable energy.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
Solar, wind, and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and maintenance accidents.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Unfortunately, their current share of global energy is pretty low.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
The major player in renewable energy is hydropower, which mostly means building dams

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
and letting water flow through turbines from a higher elevation to a lower elevation.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
In total, hydro has been the most fatal in terms of accidents, with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
One accident clearly stands out, the 1975 Bangkow hydroelectric dam failure in China,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
which has striking similarities to Chernobyl.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Old technology, poor design, and poor management by authoritarian governments concerned about appearances.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
In a nutshell, a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding that destroyed the dam

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
and, subsequently, a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic meters of water in total.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
Kilometer-wide waves as high as buildings devastated thousands of square kilometers of countryside and countless communities.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
All in all, the death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
is estimated to lie between 85,000 to 240,000.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
But all of these deaths caused by nuclear and renewable energy

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
fossil fuel, the most widely used source of energy and electricity.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
When we burn fossil fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal combustion engines,

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
gases like ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide are released into the atmosphere.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Breathing in these gases disrupts lung function, which aggravates chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
But even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
A mixture of solid and liquid droplets of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
They easily find their way deep into your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
stroke, and heart disease.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Fossil fuel-related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental-related deaths in the world.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
According to the WHO, it accounts for 29% of all cases of lung cancer,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
17% of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
24% from stroke, 25% from ischemic heart disease,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
and 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
All in all, outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
What makes air pollution especially problematic and sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually,

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the scope of the problem.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
Collectively, air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have killed around 100 million people in the past 50 years.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
But wait, is that really fair?

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
Fossil fuels also provide over 80% of global energy, so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
So let's compare deaths per energy unit.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Deaths per energy unit produced.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
A few studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per one terawatt-hour.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
That's about the annual energy consumption of 27,000 EU citizens, or 12,600 US citizens.

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
To produce that much energy for one year, coal causes 25 deaths, oil causes 18, and natural gas 3.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Renewable energy causes one death every few decades.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
And nuclear, in the worst case, nuclear energy would cause one death every 14 years.

06:52.000 --> 07:03.000
One study even found that nuclear energy actually saved 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 by displacing fossil fuels from the global energy mix.

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
The numbers are clear. Even when using wildly pessimistic numbers, nuclear energy is among the safest forms of energy generation,

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change, it's a really valuable low-carbon option.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
However, all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power.

07:23.000 --> 07:32.000
Opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk,

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind,

07:39.000 --> 07:47.000
it's arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
But a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here. More about it in our sources. Let us know if you'd like a whole video about it.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
So looking at the comparative death rates, it's a bit concerning that some countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels, mostly coal.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Especially Germany and Japan have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear fleet.

08:10.000 --> 08:20.000
In a ploy to appease the public, the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022.

08:20.000 --> 08:31.000
The immediate gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing coal production, the energy source with the largest health impacts and the worst consequences for climate change.

08:31.000 --> 08:44.000
A 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence, the nuclear phaseout has led to 1,100 avoidable deaths per year in Germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010.

08:44.000 --> 09:01.000
So in conclusion, nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is. No matter how you look at it, the one thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible are fossil fuels to prevent the deaths they cause each year and to slow down climate change.

09:01.000 --> 09:13.000
Regardless of how much you personally care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor, saving millions of lives should be something we can all agree on.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Maybe you've actually made some kind of resolution to try and be more sustainable this year.

09:18.000 --> 09:29.000
