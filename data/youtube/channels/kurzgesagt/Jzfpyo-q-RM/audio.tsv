0	5000	Nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people.
5000	10000	Ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural powers,
10000	16000	creating horribly toxic elements that, if they escape, can and have killed people in horrible ways.
16000	20000	How many people has nuclear energy killed, and how?
20000	35000	Nuclear energy has been a thing since 1951, and since then, there have been around 30 reported accidents globally.
35000	42000	Most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with, Fukushima and Chernobyl.
42000	47000	Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons.
47000	56000	The reactor technology was old and ill-prepared for emergencies, and the government response was slow and more concerned about image than damage control.
56000	60000	Still, only 31 people died directly in the accident.
60000	66000	But what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up, but the radiation they release.
66000	72000	So the real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will Chernobyl cause?
72000	76000	Here, things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy,
76000	82000	and just discussing the different estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own.
82000	91000	The most pessimistic estimate comes from a study commissioned by the European Green Party and projects up to 60,000 premature deaths by the year 2065.
91000	96000	Most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this.
96000	102000	The WHO has estimated that in total, the long-term death toll will be around 4,000,
102000	109000	while the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high.
109000	113000	For more details on this, check our research document.
113000	118000	The second big nuclear accident was Fukushima Daiichi in 2011.
118000	123000	Fukushima did not only operate with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place,
123000	129000	much better security measures were in place, and the official response was fast and decisive.
129000	133000	And so the current death toll is only 573.
133000	137000	The major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation.
137000	142000	They were indirect deaths from the stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors,
142000	146000	and occurred almost entirely in older populations.
146000	153000	Estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary widely, from none at all to about 1,000.
153000	159000	In terms of the other long-term consequences, an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed,
159000	164000	but according to the WHO, this is related to the increased screening rate.
164000	171000	By 2018, there had been only one confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation-induced lung cancer.
171000	175000	Now, let's compare this to renewable energy.
175000	183000	Solar, wind, and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and maintenance accidents.
183000	187000	Unfortunately, their current share of global energy is pretty low.
187000	192000	The major player in renewable energy is hydropower, which mostly means building dams
192000	197000	and letting water flow through turbines from a higher elevation to a lower elevation.
197000	204000	In total, hydro has been the most fatal in terms of accidents, with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century.
204000	211000	One accident clearly stands out, the 1975 Bangkow hydroelectric dam failure in China,
211000	214000	which has striking similarities to Chernobyl.
214000	221000	Old technology, poor design, and poor management by authoritarian governments concerned about appearances.
221000	226000	In a nutshell, a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding that destroyed the dam
226000	230000	and, subsequently, a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction,
231000	235000	unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic meters of water in total.
235000	242000	Kilometer-wide waves as high as buildings devastated thousands of square kilometers of countryside and countless communities.
242000	247000	All in all, the death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences
247000	252000	is estimated to lie between 85,000 to 240,000.
252000	256000	But all of these deaths caused by nuclear and renewable energy
256000	260000	are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source,
260000	265000	fossil fuel, the most widely used source of energy and electricity.
265000	269000	When we burn fossil fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin,
269000	273000	or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal combustion engines,
273000	280000	gases like ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide are released into the atmosphere.
280000	286000	Breathing in these gases disrupts lung function, which aggravates chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis
286000	291000	and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
291000	296000	But even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes.
296000	303000	A mixture of solid and liquid droplets of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter.
303000	309000	They easily find their way deep into your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer,
309000	311000	stroke, and heart disease.
311000	317000	Fossil fuel-related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental-related deaths in the world.
317000	322000	According to the WHO, it accounts for 29% of all cases of lung cancer,
322000	326000	17% of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection,
326000	330000	24% from stroke, 25% from ischemic heart disease,
330000	335000	and 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
335000	340000	All in all, outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year.
340000	348000	What makes air pollution especially problematic and sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually,
348000	355000	which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the scope of the problem.
355000	364000	Collectively, air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have killed around 100 million people in the past 50 years.
364000	367000	But wait, is that really fair?
367000	374000	Fossil fuels also provide over 80% of global energy, so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths.
374000	377000	So let's compare deaths per energy unit.
378000	381000	Deaths per energy unit produced.
381000	386000	A few studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per one terawatt-hour.
386000	394000	That's about the annual energy consumption of 27,000 EU citizens, or 12,600 US citizens.
394000	402000	To produce that much energy for one year, coal causes 25 deaths, oil causes 18, and natural gas 3.
402000	406000	Renewable energy causes one death every few decades.
406000	412000	And nuclear, in the worst case, nuclear energy would cause one death every 14 years.
412000	423000	One study even found that nuclear energy actually saved 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 by displacing fossil fuels from the global energy mix.
423000	431000	The numbers are clear. Even when using wildly pessimistic numbers, nuclear energy is among the safest forms of energy generation,
431000	438000	and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change, it's a really valuable low-carbon option.
438000	443000	However, all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power.
443000	452000	Opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk,
452000	459000	while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind,
459000	467000	it's arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change.
467000	476000	But a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here. More about it in our sources. Let us know if you'd like a whole video about it.
476000	485000	So looking at the comparative death rates, it's a bit concerning that some countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels, mostly coal.
485000	490000	Especially Germany and Japan have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear fleet.
490000	500000	In a ploy to appease the public, the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022.
500000	511000	The immediate gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing coal production, the energy source with the largest health impacts and the worst consequences for climate change.
511000	524000	A 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence, the nuclear phaseout has led to 1,100 avoidable deaths per year in Germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010.
524000	541000	So in conclusion, nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is. No matter how you look at it, the one thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible are fossil fuels to prevent the deaths they cause each year and to slow down climate change.
541000	553000	Regardless of how much you personally care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor, saving millions of lives should be something we can all agree on.
553000	558000	Maybe you've actually made some kind of resolution to try and be more sustainable this year.
