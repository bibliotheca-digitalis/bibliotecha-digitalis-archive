0	8320	The beginning of everything. The Big Bang. The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not
8320	13680	infinite. Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe as
13680	20560	infinite and ageless. Until Einstein's theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of
20560	26040	gravity and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that
26080	33440	fits previous predictions. In 1964, by accident, cosmic background radiation was discovered,
33440	38960	a relic of the early universe, which together with other observational evidence made the Big
38960	45480	Bang the accepted theory in science. Since then, improved technology like the Hubble telescope has
45480	51080	given us a pretty good picture of the Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos. Recent observations
51120	57160	even seem to suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. But how did this Big
57160	71720	Bang work? How can something come from nothing? Let's explore what we know. We can ignore the
71720	77800	beginning part for now. First of all, the Big Bang was not an explosion. It was all space,
77800	84480	stretching everywhere all at once. The universe started very, very, very small and quickly
84480	91160	expanded to the size of a football. The universe didn't expand into anything. Space was just
91160	97760	expanding into itself. The universe cannot expand into anything because the universe has no borders.
97760	105320	There is by definition, no outside the universe. The universe is all there is. In this hot,
105440	110600	dense environment, energy manifested itself in particles that existed only for the tiniest
110600	115920	glimpses of time. From gluons, pairs of quarks were created, which destroyed one another,
115920	121620	perhaps after giving off more gluons. These found other short-lived quarks to interact with,
121620	127760	forming new quark pairs and gluons again. Matter and energy were not just theoretically equivalent,
127760	134480	it was so hot, they were practically the same stuff. Somewhere around this time, matter won
134480	139800	over antimatter. Today, we're left with almost all matter and nearly no antimatter at all.
139800	145840	Somehow, one billion and one matter particles were formed for every one billion particles of
145840	151480	antimatter. Instead of one massive ultimate force in the universe, there were now several
151480	157760	refined versions of it acting under different rules. By now, the universe has stretched to a
157760	163400	billion kilometers in diameter, which leads to a decrease in temperature. The cycle of quarks being
163400	168400	born and converted back to energy suddenly stops. From now on, we work with what we have.
168400	175080	Quarks begin forming new particles, hadrons, like protons and neutrons. There are many,
175080	180200	many combinations of quarks that can form all sorts of hadrons, but only very few are reasonably
180200	187400	stable for any length of time. Please take a moment to appreciate that by now, only one second has
187400	193920	passed since the beginning of everything. The universe, which has grown to 100 billion
193920	199560	kilometers, is now cold enough to allow most of the neutrons to decay into protons and form the
199560	207160	first atom, hydrogen. Imagine the universe at this point as an extremely hot soup, 10 billion degrees
207160	212960	Celsius, filled with countless particles and energy. Over the next few minutes, things cooled
213000	220160	and settled down very fast. Atoms formed out of hadrons and electrons, making for a stable and
220160	225800	electrically neutral environment. Some call this period the Dark Age, because there were no stars
225800	231080	and the hydrogen gas didn't allow visible light to move around. But what's the meaning of visible
231080	236680	light anyway, when there's nothing alive yet that could have eyes? When the hydrogen gas clumped
236680	241960	together after millions of years, and gravity put it under great pressure, stars and galaxies began
241960	247840	to form. Their radiation dissolved the stable hydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates
247840	256480	the universe today and allows a visible light to pass. Finally, there was light. Okay, but what
256480	262640	about the part we didn't talk about? What happened right at the beginning? This part can be defined
262640	268960	as the Big Bang. We don't know at all what happened here. At this point, our tools break down.
269000	275760	Natural laws stop making sense. Time itself becomes wibbly-wobbly. To understand what happened
275760	280720	here, we need a theory that unifies Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, something
280720	287000	countless scientists are working on right now. But this leaves us with lots of unanswered questions.
287000	293920	Were there universes before our own? Is this the first and the only universe? What started the Big
293960	300600	Bang? Or did it just occur naturally based on laws we don't understand yet? We don't know,
300600	307000	and maybe we never will. But what we do know is that the universe as we know it started here,
307000	315920	and gave birth to particles, galaxies, stars, the Earth, and you. Since we ourselves are made of
315920	322480	dead stars, we are not separate from the universe. We are part of it. You could even say that we are
322520	328800	the universe's way of experiencing itself. So let's keep on experiencing it until there
328800	330280	are no more questions to ask.
