00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
The beginning of everything. The Big Bang. The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not

00:08.320 --> 00:13.680
infinite. Up to the middle of the 20th century, most scientists thought of the universe as

00:13.680 --> 00:20.560
infinite and ageless. Until Einstein's theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of

00:20.560 --> 00:26.040
gravity and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that

00:26.080 --> 00:33.440
fits previous predictions. In 1964, by accident, cosmic background radiation was discovered,

00:33.440 --> 00:38.960
a relic of the early universe, which together with other observational evidence made the Big

00:38.960 --> 00:45.480
Bang the accepted theory in science. Since then, improved technology like the Hubble telescope has

00:45.480 --> 00:51.080
given us a pretty good picture of the Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos. Recent observations

00:51.120 --> 00:57.160
even seem to suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. But how did this Big

00:57.160 --> 01:11.720
Bang work? How can something come from nothing? Let's explore what we know. We can ignore the

01:11.720 --> 01:17.800
beginning part for now. First of all, the Big Bang was not an explosion. It was all space,

01:17.800 --> 01:24.480
stretching everywhere all at once. The universe started very, very, very small and quickly

01:24.480 --> 01:31.160
expanded to the size of a football. The universe didn't expand into anything. Space was just

01:31.160 --> 01:37.760
expanding into itself. The universe cannot expand into anything because the universe has no borders.

01:37.760 --> 01:45.320
There is by definition, no outside the universe. The universe is all there is. In this hot,

01:45.440 --> 01:50.600
dense environment, energy manifested itself in particles that existed only for the tiniest

01:50.600 --> 01:55.920
glimpses of time. From gluons, pairs of quarks were created, which destroyed one another,

01:55.920 --> 02:01.620
perhaps after giving off more gluons. These found other short-lived quarks to interact with,

02:01.620 --> 02:07.760
forming new quark pairs and gluons again. Matter and energy were not just theoretically equivalent,

02:07.760 --> 02:14.480
it was so hot, they were practically the same stuff. Somewhere around this time, matter won

02:14.480 --> 02:19.800
over antimatter. Today, we're left with almost all matter and nearly no antimatter at all.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.840
Somehow, one billion and one matter particles were formed for every one billion particles of

02:25.840 --> 02:31.480
antimatter. Instead of one massive ultimate force in the universe, there were now several

02:31.480 --> 02:37.760
refined versions of it acting under different rules. By now, the universe has stretched to a

02:37.760 --> 02:43.400
billion kilometers in diameter, which leads to a decrease in temperature. The cycle of quarks being

02:43.400 --> 02:48.400
born and converted back to energy suddenly stops. From now on, we work with what we have.

02:48.400 --> 02:55.080
Quarks begin forming new particles, hadrons, like protons and neutrons. There are many,

02:55.080 --> 03:00.200
many combinations of quarks that can form all sorts of hadrons, but only very few are reasonably

03:00.200 --> 03:07.400
stable for any length of time. Please take a moment to appreciate that by now, only one second has

03:07.400 --> 03:13.920
passed since the beginning of everything. The universe, which has grown to 100 billion

03:13.920 --> 03:19.560
kilometers, is now cold enough to allow most of the neutrons to decay into protons and form the

03:19.560 --> 03:27.160
first atom, hydrogen. Imagine the universe at this point as an extremely hot soup, 10 billion degrees

03:27.160 --> 03:32.960
Celsius, filled with countless particles and energy. Over the next few minutes, things cooled

03:33.000 --> 03:40.160
and settled down very fast. Atoms formed out of hadrons and electrons, making for a stable and

03:40.160 --> 03:45.800
electrically neutral environment. Some call this period the Dark Age, because there were no stars

03:45.800 --> 03:51.080
and the hydrogen gas didn't allow visible light to move around. But what's the meaning of visible

03:51.080 --> 03:56.680
light anyway, when there's nothing alive yet that could have eyes? When the hydrogen gas clumped

03:56.680 --> 04:01.960
together after millions of years, and gravity put it under great pressure, stars and galaxies began

04:01.960 --> 04:07.840
to form. Their radiation dissolved the stable hydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates

04:07.840 --> 04:16.480
the universe today and allows a visible light to pass. Finally, there was light. Okay, but what

04:16.480 --> 04:22.640
about the part we didn't talk about? What happened right at the beginning? This part can be defined

04:22.640 --> 04:28.960
as the Big Bang. We don't know at all what happened here. At this point, our tools break down.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.760
Natural laws stop making sense. Time itself becomes wibbly-wobbly. To understand what happened

04:35.760 --> 04:40.720
here, we need a theory that unifies Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, something

04:40.720 --> 04:47.000
countless scientists are working on right now. But this leaves us with lots of unanswered questions.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.920
Were there universes before our own? Is this the first and the only universe? What started the Big

04:53.960 --> 05:00.600
Bang? Or did it just occur naturally based on laws we don't understand yet? We don't know,

05:00.600 --> 05:07.000
and maybe we never will. But what we do know is that the universe as we know it started here,

05:07.000 --> 05:15.920
and gave birth to particles, galaxies, stars, the Earth, and you. Since we ourselves are made of

05:15.920 --> 05:22.480
dead stars, we are not separate from the universe. We are part of it. You could even say that we are

05:22.520 --> 05:28.800
the universe's way of experiencing itself. So let's keep on experiencing it until there

05:28.800 --> 05:30.280
are no more questions to ask.

05:52.480 --> 05:52.560
