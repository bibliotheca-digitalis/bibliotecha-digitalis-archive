0	5200	When our vegetarian ancestors started eating meat around 2 million years ago,
5200	9200	it wasn't just because animals taste great, it was pure necessity.
9200	14500	Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors relied on less available,
14500	16700	and meat bridged that gap.
16700	22700	From the discovery of fire at the latest, meat became a staple of the human diet.
22700	29700	But over the last few years, eating meat has increasingly been associated with health risks like heart disease,
29700	32700	certain cancers, and an early death.
32700	36700	So, how unhealthy is meat really?
46700	48700	In this video, we'll only talk about meat.
48700	51700	Dairy products deserve a video of their own.
51700	54700	Biologically, we need to eat for three reasons.
54700	58700	For energy, to acquire materials to fabricate our cells,
58700	62700	and to get special molecules that our bodies can't make themselves.
62700	69700	The energy and most of the materials come from the three macronutrients, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.
69700	75700	Proteins are the most important resource for repairing and replenishing our cell structures.
75700	82700	The special molecules are a large variety of vitamins and minerals we need to drive metabolic processes.
82700	85700	Meat provides us with most of these things.
85700	93700	It contains all essential amino acids our body needs, and a lot of minerals like iron, zinc, and essential vitamins,
93700	97700	some of which are barely found in plants like vitamin B12.
97700	103700	Only one essential nutrient is missing in most of the meat we consume, vitamin C.
103700	110700	It appears in almost all plants, and supports our immune system as well as the development of connective tissues.
110700	114700	After a few months without it, you'd get scurvy.
114700	118700	But meat has another big advantage, its high bioavailability.
118700	124700	Some of the nutrients in meat are broken down faster and available quicker than those from plants.
124700	132700	Spinach, for example, contains more iron than meat, but it's absorbed much slower, and the body needs more energy to digest it.
132700	137700	Several health benefits have also been observed in communities that rely solely on meat.
138700	145700	The Inuit, for example, are able to survive in extreme climate conditions on a purely meat-based diet, if necessary.
145700	152700	Since they consume the whole animal, including the organs, they get every single nutrient they need, including vitamin C.
152700	156700	So meat itself is definitely not dangerous for us.
156700	162700	But its health effects vary, depending on how it's prepared and what animal it comes from.
163700	169700	When talking about meat in the Western world, we generally mean muscle tissues that have a high nutrient density,
169700	174700	but also lack some of the vitamins that make it possible to survive on meat alone.
174700	178700	The most healthy animals to eat are probably fish.
178700	188700	Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and support anti-inflammatory immune functions.
188700	193700	As part of a balanced diet, fish can be eaten regularly without worries.
193700	200700	Eating fish comes with its own bag of complications, though, like overfishing and the destruction of the oceans.
200700	203700	We'll talk about that in another video.
203700	207700	A close second is the most popular meat, chicken.
207700	210700	It's regarded as the meat with the fewest health risks.
210700	215700	The only negative health effect of poultry is a bit controversial, fat.
215700	222700	Its high content of saturated fats is associated with a higher cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease.
222700	232700	But this idea has also been criticized by a large number of scientists, arguing high cholesterol levels might be inherited and not caused by nutrition.
232700	238700	So, in general, if you want meat and are concerned about your health, go for chicken.
239700	248700	Things start to get problematic with high intakes of red meat like beef, veal, pork, lamb, horse, and goat.
248700	257700	A recently published study recommends, for example, a maximum of 23 grams of red meat per day, which is a very small steak per week.
257700	263700	However, large-scale meta-analysis studies have shown that eating 100 grams of red meat every day
263700	273700	increases the relative risk of diabetes by 19%, of strokes by 11%, and of colorectal cancer by 17%.
273700	279700	This sounds alarming, but before we panic, let's have a look at how these studies were conducted.
279700	286700	Because this brings us to the second big problem when trying to answer the question of whether meat is unhealthy or not.
286700	291700	Most studies that linked health risks to eating red meat were case-control studies,
291700	297700	which means taking a group of people with a disease and classifying them by their eating habits.
297700	302700	The more red meat they consume, the more likely they were to contract certain diseases.
302700	306700	The problem is that it's very hard to eliminate other factors.
306700	310700	People who eat less meat tend to live a healthier lifestyle in general.
310700	316700	They tend to eat more vegetables and fruit, and are less likely to smoke and drink alcohol.
316700	322700	Most studies try to eliminate these factors, but it's extremely hard to make definitive statements.
322700	326700	Things get worse when we look at processed meat, though.
326700	332700	Processing meat means adding certain chemicals by curing, smoking, salting, or fermenting.
332700	335700	Or in other words, making it delicious.
335700	341700	Bacon, ham, salami, sausages, and hot dogs contain chemicals that are harmful for us,
341700	347700	like nitrates and nitrites that can damage the DNA in our digestive system and lead to cancer.
347700	351700	The WHO reviewed 800 studies over 20 years,
351700	356700	and concluded that processed meat is strongly linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
356700	363700	Each extra 50 grams of processed meat per day increases your relative risk of cancer by 18%.
363700	371700	When it comes to cancer risk, processed meat is now in the same category as plutonium, asbestos, and smoking.
371700	377700	The WHO highlights that its research is only about the question of whether or not something causes cancer,
377700	379700	and not to what extent.
379700	387700	But processed meat may also significantly increase the chance of suffering from diabetes, strokes, and coronary heart diseases.
388700	393700	It also makes a difference what sort of life our meat lived when it was still part of a living being.
393700	401700	It's common to feed large amounts of antibiotics to livestock in order to prevent diseases which can spread antibiotic resistance.
401700	410700	Combined, a high consumption of both red and processed meat could increase your chance of premature death by up to 29%.
410700	416700	This means if your chance of dying is 3% this year, it's now 4%.
416700	422700	This might not sound like a lot, but tiny percentages have a huge impact on societies of millions.
422700	426700	They also seem harmless until they affect you.
426700	430700	To blame meat alone for bad health would be wrong though.
430700	435700	There is no evidence that the very essence of meat has any negative effect beyond its high fat content,
435700	438700	and even this point is highly contentious.
438700	445700	Just like with many other pleasures in life, sometimes too much of a good thing is harmful.
445700	450700	Most public health agencies suggest cutting meat consumption to 500 grams a week,
450700	455700	while studies suggest cutting down processed meat as much as possible.
455700	460700	So if you feast on meat no more than once or twice a week, you should be good.
460700	465700	For most people this already means a drastic change in their diets though.
465700	470700	The average American consumes around almost 1,600 grams of meat a week.
470700	474700	The average German 1,100 grams a week.
474700	477700	And many of us eat much, much more.
477700	482700	If you're not really sure, make a small note whenever you eat meat for a week or two.
482700	485700	You'll be surprised how much it really is.
485700	490700	So most people watching this video would benefit from cutting down on meat.
490700	496700	Aside from health concerns, there's still the fact that the meat industry is one of the largest contributors to climate change
496700	503700	and has reached a scale where it's impossible to deliver millions of tons of meat and still treat animals with dignity.
503700	507700	We've already discussed that in detail in another video.
507700	513700	All in all, in moderation, meat is not unhealthy and you don't need to become vegetarian overnight
513700	516700	to have a real impact on your health and the planet.
516700	522700	But your lifestyle choices do matter, for yourself and for others.
522700	526700	The key is being open to trying something new once in a while.
526700	528700	Maybe you'll discover your new favorite dish.
528700	532700	Until you try, you'll never know what you'll enjoy or what you're capable of.
532700	538700	Maybe after watching hours of Kurzgesagt videos, you've decided you'd like to learn how to animate.
538700	543700	Now you might not know this, but most of our team actually has a graphic design background.
543700	549700	Learning about design principles first before we got into animation was really key to where we are today.
549700	553700	There's a really great new Skillshare class on using Adobe Illustrator,
553700	559700	the software we use to create artwork, by graphic designer Erin Draplin and we can personally recommend it.
560700	565700	It's full of great tips to help understand and simplify a very complicated program.
565700	571700	If you want to do more afterwards, we have three animation courses of our own on Skillshare too.
571700	576700	Skillshare offers over 25,000 classes on topics like film and video editing,
576700	580700	writing, design and technology from an array of skilled experts.
580700	585700	With the premium membership, you can access all of them for only $10 a month.
585700	592700	And as a bonus, the first 1,000 Kurzgesagt viewers to use the link in the description will get their first two months of Skillshare for free.
