1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
When our vegetarian ancestors started eating meat around 2 million years ago,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
it wasn't just because animals taste great, it was pure necessity.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,500
Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors relied on less available,

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,700
and meat bridged that gap.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,700
From the discovery of fire at the latest, meat became a staple of the human diet.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:29,700
But over the last few years, eating meat has increasingly been associated with health risks like heart disease,

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,700
certain cancers, and an early death.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,700
So, how unhealthy is meat really?

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
In this video, we'll only talk about meat.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Dairy products deserve a video of their own.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,700
Biologically, we need to eat for three reasons.

12
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,700
For energy, to acquire materials to fabricate our cells,

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
and to get special molecules that our bodies can't make themselves.

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:09,700
The energy and most of the materials come from the three macronutrients, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,700
Proteins are the most important resource for repairing and replenishing our cell structures.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,700
The special molecules are a large variety of vitamins and minerals we need to drive metabolic processes.

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Meat provides us with most of these things.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,700
It contains all essential amino acids our body needs, and a lot of minerals like iron, zinc, and essential vitamins,

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
some of which are barely found in plants like vitamin B12.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Only one essential nutrient is missing in most of the meat we consume, vitamin C.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,700
It appears in almost all plants, and supports our immune system as well as the development of connective tissues.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
After a few months without it, you'd get scurvy.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,700
But meat has another big advantage, its high bioavailability.

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Some of the nutrients in meat are broken down faster and available quicker than those from plants.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Spinach, for example, contains more iron than meat, but it's absorbed much slower, and the body needs more energy to digest it.

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Several health benefits have also been observed in communities that rely solely on meat.

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,700
The Inuit, for example, are able to survive in extreme climate conditions on a purely meat-based diet, if necessary.

28
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Since they consume the whole animal, including the organs, they get every single nutrient they need, including vitamin C.

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,700
So meat itself is definitely not dangerous for us.

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,700
But its health effects vary, depending on how it's prepared and what animal it comes from.

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,700
When talking about meat in the Western world, we generally mean muscle tissues that have a high nutrient density,

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,700
but also lack some of the vitamins that make it possible to survive on meat alone.

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,700
The most healthy animals to eat are probably fish.

34
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases and support anti-inflammatory immune functions.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,700
As part of a balanced diet, fish can be eaten regularly without worries.

36
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Eating fish comes with its own bag of complications, though, like overfishing and the destruction of the oceans.

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
We'll talk about that in another video.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
A close second is the most popular meat, chicken.

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
It's regarded as the meat with the fewest health risks.

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,700
The only negative health effect of poultry is a bit controversial, fat.

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Its high content of saturated fats is associated with a higher cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease.

42
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:52,700
But this idea has also been criticized by a large number of scientists, arguing high cholesterol levels might be inherited and not caused by nutrition.

43
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,700
So, in general, if you want meat and are concerned about your health, go for chicken.

44
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Things start to get problematic with high intakes of red meat like beef, veal, pork, lamb, horse, and goat.

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:17,700
A recently published study recommends, for example, a maximum of 23 grams of red meat per day, which is a very small steak per week.

46
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,700
However, large-scale meta-analysis studies have shown that eating 100 grams of red meat every day

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:33,700
increases the relative risk of diabetes by 19%, of strokes by 11%, and of colorectal cancer by 17%.

48
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,700
This sounds alarming, but before we panic, let's have a look at how these studies were conducted.

49
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Because this brings us to the second big problem when trying to answer the question of whether meat is unhealthy or not.

50
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Most studies that linked health risks to eating red meat were case-control studies,

51
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,700
which means taking a group of people with a disease and classifying them by their eating habits.

52
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,700
The more red meat they consume, the more likely they were to contract certain diseases.

53
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,700
The problem is that it's very hard to eliminate other factors.

54
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,700
People who eat less meat tend to live a healthier lifestyle in general.

55
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,700
They tend to eat more vegetables and fruit, and are less likely to smoke and drink alcohol.

56
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Most studies try to eliminate these factors, but it's extremely hard to make definitive statements.

57
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Things get worse when we look at processed meat, though.

58
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Processing meat means adding certain chemicals by curing, smoking, salting, or fermenting.

59
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Or in other words, making it delicious.

60
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Bacon, ham, salami, sausages, and hot dogs contain chemicals that are harmful for us,

61
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,700
like nitrates and nitrites that can damage the DNA in our digestive system and lead to cancer.

62
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
The WHO reviewed 800 studies over 20 years,

63
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,700
and concluded that processed meat is strongly linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

64
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,700
Each extra 50 grams of processed meat per day increases your relative risk of cancer by 18%.

65
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:11,700
When it comes to cancer risk, processed meat is now in the same category as plutonium, asbestos, and smoking.

66
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,700
The WHO highlights that its research is only about the question of whether or not something causes cancer,

67
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
and not to what extent.

68
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:27,700
But processed meat may also significantly increase the chance of suffering from diabetes, strokes, and coronary heart diseases.

69
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,700
It also makes a difference what sort of life our meat lived when it was still part of a living being.

70
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:41,700
It's common to feed large amounts of antibiotics to livestock in order to prevent diseases which can spread antibiotic resistance.

71
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:50,700
Combined, a high consumption of both red and processed meat could increase your chance of premature death by up to 29%.

72
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,700
This means if your chance of dying is 3% this year, it's now 4%.

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,700
This might not sound like a lot, but tiny percentages have a huge impact on societies of millions.

74
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,700
They also seem harmless until they affect you.

75
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,700
To blame meat alone for bad health would be wrong though.

76
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,700
There is no evidence that the very essence of meat has any negative effect beyond its high fat content,

77
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,700
and even this point is highly contentious.

78
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Just like with many other pleasures in life, sometimes too much of a good thing is harmful.

79
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Most public health agencies suggest cutting meat consumption to 500 grams a week,

80
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,700
while studies suggest cutting down processed meat as much as possible.

81
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,700
So if you feast on meat no more than once or twice a week, you should be good.

82
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,700
For most people this already means a drastic change in their diets though.

83
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,700
The average American consumes around almost 1,600 grams of meat a week.

84
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,700
The average German 1,100 grams a week.

85
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,700
And many of us eat much, much more.

86
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,700
If you're not really sure, make a small note whenever you eat meat for a week or two.

87
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,700
You'll be surprised how much it really is.

88
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,700
So most people watching this video would benefit from cutting down on meat.

89
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Aside from health concerns, there's still the fact that the meat industry is one of the largest contributors to climate change

90
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,700
and has reached a scale where it's impossible to deliver millions of tons of meat and still treat animals with dignity.

91
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
We've already discussed that in detail in another video.

92
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,700
All in all, in moderation, meat is not unhealthy and you don't need to become vegetarian overnight

93
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
to have a real impact on your health and the planet.

94
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,700
But your lifestyle choices do matter, for yourself and for others.

95
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
The key is being open to trying something new once in a while.

96
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Maybe you'll discover your new favorite dish.

97
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Until you try, you'll never know what you'll enjoy or what you're capable of.

98
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Maybe after watching hours of Kurzgesagt videos, you've decided you'd like to learn how to animate.

99
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Now you might not know this, but most of our team actually has a graphic design background.

100
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Learning about design principles first before we got into animation was really key to where we are today.

101
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,700
There's a really great new Skillshare class on using Adobe Illustrator,

102
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,700
the software we use to create artwork, by graphic designer Erin Draplin and we can personally recommend it.

103
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,700
It's full of great tips to help understand and simplify a very complicated program.

104
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,700
If you want to do more afterwards, we have three animation courses of our own on Skillshare too.

105
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Skillshare offers over 25,000 classes on topics like film and video editing,

106
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,700
writing, design and technology from an array of skilled experts.

107
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,700
With the premium membership, you can access all of them for only $10 a month.

108
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,700
And as a bonus, the first 1,000 Kurzgesagt viewers to use the link in the description will get their first two months of Skillshare for free.
