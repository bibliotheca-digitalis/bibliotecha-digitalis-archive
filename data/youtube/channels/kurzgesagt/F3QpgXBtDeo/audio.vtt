00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
What is the stock exchange, and how does it work?

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
The stock exchange is nothing more than a giant, globally networked and organized marketplace,

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
where everyday huge sums of money are moved back and forth.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
In total, over 60 trillion euros a year are traded.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
More than the value of all goods and services of the entire world economy.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
However, it's not apples or second-hand toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
But predominantly, securities.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Securities are rights to assets, mostly in the form of shares.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
A share stands for a share in a company.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
But why are shares traded at all?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Well, first and foremost, the value of a share relates to the company behind it.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
If you think of the value of the company in terms of a pizza,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
the bigger the overall size of the pizza, the bigger every piece is.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
If, for example, Facebook is able to greatly increase its profits with a new business model,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
the size of the company's pizza will also increase,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
and as a result, so will the value of its shares.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
This is of course great for the shareholders.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros could now be worth a whole 50 euros.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
When it's sold, this represents a profit of 12 euros per share.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But what does Facebook gain from this?

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
The company can raise funds by selling the shares and invest or expand its business.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Facebook, for example, has earned $16 billion from its listing on the stock exchange.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
The trading of shares, though, is frequently a game of chance.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
No one can say which company will perform well and which will not.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
If a company has a good reputation, investors will back it.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
A company with a poor reputation or poor performance will have difficulty selling its shares.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Unlike a normal market in which goods can be touched and taken home,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
on the stock exchange only virtual goods are available.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
They appear in the form of share prices and tables on monitors.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Such share prices can rise or fall within seconds.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Shareholders therefore have to act quickly in order not to miss an opportunity.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for a share falling fast,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
regardless of the real value of the company.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Of course, the opposite is also possible.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
If a particularly large number of people buy weak shares

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
because they see, for example, great potential behind an idea,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
their value will rise as a result.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
In particular, young companies can benefit from this.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Even though their sales might be falling, they can generate cash by placing their shares.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
In the best case scenario, this will result in their idea being turned into reality.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
In the worst case scenario, this will result in a speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
And, as in the case with bubbles, at some point they will burst.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
The value of Germany's biggest 30 companies is summarized in what's known as the DAX share index.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
The DAX curve shows how well or poorly these major companies,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
and thereby the economy as a whole, are performing at the present time.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Stock exchanges in other countries also have their own indices,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
and all of these markets together create a globally networked marketplace.
