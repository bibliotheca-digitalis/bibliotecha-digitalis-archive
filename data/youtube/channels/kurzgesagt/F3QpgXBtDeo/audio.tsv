0	3000	What is the stock exchange, and how does it work?
4000	9000	The stock exchange is nothing more than a giant, globally networked and organized marketplace,
9000	13000	where everyday huge sums of money are moved back and forth.
14000	18000	In total, over 60 trillion euros a year are traded.
19000	23000	More than the value of all goods and services of the entire world economy.
24000	29000	However, it's not apples or second-hand toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace.
30000	32000	But predominantly, securities.
33000	36000	Securities are rights to assets, mostly in the form of shares.
37000	39000	A share stands for a share in a company.
40000	42000	But why are shares traded at all?
43000	47000	Well, first and foremost, the value of a share relates to the company behind it.
48000	50000	If you think of the value of the company in terms of a pizza,
51000	54000	the bigger the overall size of the pizza, the bigger every piece is.
55000	59000	If, for example, Facebook is able to greatly increase its profits with a new business model,
60000	62000	the size of the company's pizza will also increase,
63000	65000	and as a result, so will the value of its shares.
66000	68000	This is of course great for the shareholders.
69000	73000	A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros could now be worth a whole 50 euros.
75000	78000	When it's sold, this represents a profit of 12 euros per share.
79000	81000	But what does Facebook gain from this?
81000	86000	The company can raise funds by selling the shares and invest or expand its business.
87000	92000	Facebook, for example, has earned $16 billion from its listing on the stock exchange.
93000	95000	The trading of shares, though, is frequently a game of chance.
96000	99000	No one can say which company will perform well and which will not.
100000	103000	If a company has a good reputation, investors will back it.
104000	108000	A company with a poor reputation or poor performance will have difficulty selling its shares.
109000	112000	Unlike a normal market in which goods can be touched and taken home,
113000	116000	on the stock exchange only virtual goods are available.
117000	121000	They appear in the form of share prices and tables on monitors.
122000	124000	Such share prices can rise or fall within seconds.
125000	129000	Shareholders therefore have to act quickly in order not to miss an opportunity.
130000	132000	Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for a share falling fast,
133000	135000	regardless of the real value of the company.
135000	139000	Of course, the opposite is also possible.
140000	142000	If a particularly large number of people buy weak shares
143000	145000	because they see, for example, great potential behind an idea,
146000	147000	their value will rise as a result.
148000	150000	In particular, young companies can benefit from this.
151000	156000	Even though their sales might be falling, they can generate cash by placing their shares.
157000	161000	In the best case scenario, this will result in their idea being turned into reality.
162000	167000	In the worst case scenario, this will result in a speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air.
168000	171000	And, as in the case with bubbles, at some point they will burst.
172000	177000	The value of Germany's biggest 30 companies is summarized in what's known as the DAX share index.
179000	182000	The DAX curve shows how well or poorly these major companies,
183000	186000	and thereby the economy as a whole, are performing at the present time.
187000	191000	Stock exchanges in other countries also have their own indices,
192000	196000	and all of these markets together create a globally networked marketplace.
