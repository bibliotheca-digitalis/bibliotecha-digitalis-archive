00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is the stock exchange, and how does it work?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The stock exchange is nothing more than a giant, globally networked and organized marketplace,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where everyday huge sums of money are moved back and forth.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In total, over 60 trillion euros a year are traded.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
More than the value of all goods and services of the entire world economy.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
However, it's not apples or second-hand toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But predominantly, securities.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Securities are rights to assets, mostly in the form of shares.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A share stands for a share in a company.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But why are shares traded at all?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, first and foremost, the value of a share relates to the company behind it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you think of the value of the company in terms of a pizza,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the bigger the overall size of the pizza, the bigger every piece is.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If, for example, Facebook is able to greatly increase its profits with a new business model,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the size of the company's pizza will also increase,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and as a result, so will the value of its shares.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is of course great for the shareholders.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros could now be worth a whole 50 euros.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When it's sold, this represents a profit of 12 euros per share.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But what does Facebook gain from this?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The company can raise funds by selling the shares and invest or expand its business.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Facebook, for example, has earned $16 billion from its listing on the stock exchange.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The trading of shares, though, is frequently a game of chance.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No one can say which company will perform well and which will not.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If a company has a good reputation, investors will back it.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A company with a poor reputation or poor performance will have difficulty selling its shares.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Unlike a normal market in which goods can be touched and taken home,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
on the stock exchange only virtual goods are available.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They appear in the form of share prices and tables on monitors.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Such share prices can rise or fall within seconds.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Shareholders therefore have to act quickly in order not to miss an opportunity.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for a share falling fast,

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
regardless of the real value of the company.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course, the opposite is also possible.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If a particularly large number of people buy weak shares

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because they see, for example, great potential behind an idea,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
their value will rise as a result.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In particular, young companies can benefit from this.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Even though their sales might be falling, they can generate cash by placing their shares.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In the best case scenario, this will result in their idea being turned into reality.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In the worst case scenario, this will result in a speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And, as in the case with bubbles, at some point they will burst.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The value of Germany's biggest 30 companies is summarized in what's known as the DAX share index.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The DAX curve shows how well or poorly these major companies,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and thereby the economy as a whole, are performing at the present time.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stock exchanges in other countries also have their own indices,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and all of these markets together create a globally networked marketplace.
