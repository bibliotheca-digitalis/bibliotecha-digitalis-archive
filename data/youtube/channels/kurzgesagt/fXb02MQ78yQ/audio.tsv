0	7000	The Earth is a gigantic ball of semi-molten rock with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the sun.
7000	16000	Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up.
16000	21000	Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface.
21000	25000	Earth's crust is the only thing in their way.
25000	32000	It feels solid to us, but it's only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth.
32000	39000	True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined,
39000	47000	subjecting the climate to centuries worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases.
47000	49000	Super volcanoes.
49000	51000	How big can they get?
51000	54000	And will they put an end to humanity?
62000	64000	Volcanoes.
64000	71000	There are many types of volcanoes from towering mountains to lava domes, but they have two main sources.
71000	78000	The first is at the boundaries between tectonic plates, the pieces of the crust that cover the Earth like a giant jigsaw puzzle.
78000	85000	There are seven major tectonic plates and dozens of smaller ones, drifting against each other at up to 15 centimeters per year.
85000	92000	This sounds slow, but on geological timescales, it is a titanic struggle over who gets to stay on the surface.
92000	101000	The winning plate crumples into a new mountain range, while the loser is shoved underneath into an ocean of hot rock at 1,300 degrees Celsius.
101000	103000	The asthenosphere.
103000	111000	The temperature here is enough to melt rock into a liquid, but the insane pressures of all that mass keep it a superheated solid.
111000	117000	Tectonic plates are usually in contact with water for thousands of years and absorb some of it.
117000	125000	When they are submerged into the hot underworld, this water triggers chemical transformations that allow tiny portions to melt into magma.
125000	134000	Liquid magma is less dense than solid rock, so it rises to the surface in furious bubbles that accumulate in sponge-like reservoirs right under the crust.
134000	142000	If enough magma accumulates, it becomes powerful enough to pierce through the crust, which we experience as volcanoes.
142000	148000	This happens under the winning plate, like a revenge attack by the loser before it's erased forever.
148000	152000	The second main source of volcanoes are thought to be mantle plumes.
152000	159000	These are columns of abnormally hot rock that rise all the way from the planet's core mantle boundary to the surface.
159000	168000	Much less is known about them, but in a way, it's as if the Earth's mantle has weather patterns and mantle plumes are a little like hot air, rising to form storm clouds.
168000	175000	Storms hundreds of millions of years old, made of rock circulating at a rate of a few millimeters per month.
175000	185000	They don't care about the motion of tectonic plates, so they can break the crust to create volcanoes in the middle of nowhere that stubbornly stay active as the crust shifts around them.
185000	195000	The volcanic boom meter. Scientists love to put big booms on a scale, and came up with a logarithmic scale that measures the volume ejected during an eruption.
195000	204000	The volcanic explosivity index, or VEI. Simply put, it starts really small and gets very big very quickly.
205000	213000	A VEI-2 eruption would fill 400 full Olympic swimming pools with lava. We have around 10 of these per year.
213000	223000	At VEI-3, we already see devastating effects, like the eruption of the Semaru volcano in 2021, that destroyed thousands of homes in Indonesia.
223000	233000	At VEI-5, we see catastrophic amounts of materials. Cubic kilometers of debris, equivalent to an entire lake of molten rock blasted into the air.
233000	241000	Like the 2022 Hongatonga-Hongahapai eruption that sent a shockwave around the globe many times, and created ocean-wide tsunamis.
241000	253000	At a VEI of 6, an eruption can change the world. In 1883, the Indonesian island volcano Krakatoa erupted nearly continuously over the course of five months.
253000	258000	One of those eruptions blew it apart, producing the loudest sound recorded in history.
258000	263000	Ten trillion times louder than a rocket taking off, heard halfway around the world.
263000	273000	30 meter high tsunamis swept away nearby populations, and so much gas and ash were released that global temperatures cooled by nearly 0.5 degrees Celsius.
273000	277000	Red, dusty sunsets followed for many years.
277000	287000	At VEI-7, we get super colossal eruptions. Millennium-defining events that human civilization has only encountered a handful of times.
287000	296000	Mount Tambora was a 4,300 meter high mountain until it exploded in 1815, and released 400 times more energy than the Tsar Bomba.
296000	305000	140 billion tons of ash and dust were shot halfway to space before smothering the world's skies, turning them a sickly yellow.
305000	311000	There was no summer the following year, crops died, and over 100,000 people perished.
311000	321000	This is the dreadful potential of volcanic eruptions, with famines across the other side of the world, and even centuries-long cold periods being attributed to them.
321000	324000	Okay, but what's a supervolcano?
324000	330000	The term supervolcano is a media invention, and not a scientific term.
330000	335000	The main issue with them is that not every eruption from a supervolcano is a super-eruption.
335000	341000	What makes supervolcanoes special is that they've been waiting to erupt for hundreds of thousands of years.
341000	349000	Pressure builds up in colossal magma reservoirs several kilometers deep until it becomes strong enough to lift the rock above it by several meters.
349000	357000	Rocks crack under the pressure until they finally give way and billions of tons of gas and ash blast out at supersonic speed.
357000	363000	An insane explosion of at least a thousand cubic kilometers that impacts every corner of the globe.
363000	367000	And yet, that is only a small portion of the magma reservoir.
367000	373000	Super-eruptions are like a boiling pot of water, popping its lid off and spilling a bit off the top.
373000	378000	Afterwards, the ground collapses into the void left behind, forming a hole called a caldera.
378000	385000	Under this caldera, pressure starts building again until the volcano gathers enough energy for another super-eruption.
385000	388000	But this could take hundreds of thousands of years.
388000	397000	It's estimated that one of the few volcanoes capable of super-eruptions on Earth could cause a catastrophic eruption every 17,000 years on average.
397000	401000	That would make them far more frequent than comparable asteroid impacts.
401000	408000	The most recent super-eruption is the Oranui eruption 26,500 years ago in New Zealand.
408000	419000	With the force of dozens of billions of tons of TNT, a Mount Everest-sized pile of explosives, a huge portion of the landscape was scooped out and thrown into the atmosphere.
419000	427000	It left behind a caldera spanning 20 kilometers, and it caused the entire southern hemisphere to undergo a period of abrupt cooling.
427000	431000	Though among super-eruptions, it's a mere firework.
431000	437000	The Lake Toba eruption of 74,000 years ago was a much more significant turning point in history.
437000	450000	It released a gargantuan 5,300 cubic kilometers of material, enough to blanket parts of South Asia in 15 centimeters of ash and trigger a rapid 4 degrees Celsius drop in global temperatures.
450000	456000	It's possible that the volcanic winter lasted 10 years, followed by worldwide droughts for centuries.
456000	460000	Earth's climate might have not recovered for a thousand years.
460000	467000	The largest volcanic events we know of were not really huge explosions, but floods of millions of cubic kilometers of lava.
467000	476000	The grand finale were the Siberian Traps around 250 million years ago, a continuous release of lava for 2 million years.
476000	484000	They raised the ocean temperatures to over 40 degrees Celsius, which caused the Permian-Triassic extinction, killing over 90% of all species.
484000	488000	Earth's surface needed 9 million years to recover.
488000	493000	These sorts of eruptions don't change the climate, they are the climate.
493000	499000	But thankfully, we haven't seen anything even remotely close to that scale in many millions of years.
499000	504000	So, should you be scared of supervolcanoes? Definitely not.
504000	510000	They've been used to frighten many people, and are overhyped as an unavoidable apocalypse.
510000	516000	The most famous one, Yellowstone, will erupt again, but they will be relatively small eruptions.
516000	523000	Natural disasters for sure, but not enough to devastate the US or come close to ending humanity.
523000	532000	The chance of a VEI-8 eruption in the next few hundred years is less than 2%, and more importantly, it wouldn't come as a sudden surprise.
532000	541000	However, less powerful but more frequent eruptions can also do serious damage to our civilizations, and are in many ways a much greater concern.
541000	552000	So, we must watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs, like ground swelling and temperature increases, to get an early warning that can save the lives of people living the closest to a volcano.
552000	562000	And, there's time to develop solutions that can remove sulfur and ash from the stratosphere to eliminate the root cause of the climate disruption we've seen from previous eruptions.
562000	572000	Who knows, maybe we'll even be able to turn this force of destruction into an agent for good by exploiting the geothermal energy held in their giant magma reservoirs.
572000	583000	We've done this work for so many other disasters, and we are already doing things we could only have dreamed about decades ago, like sending a probe to perform our first asteroid redirection test.
583000	588000	With determination, humanity really can solve anything.
588000	596000	So, while deep below us an angry hell is churning, and waiting for its moment, you can sleep well tonight.
599000	606000	Learning how we can get ahead of catastrophes like climate change and supervolcanoes is interesting, but can also be challenging.
