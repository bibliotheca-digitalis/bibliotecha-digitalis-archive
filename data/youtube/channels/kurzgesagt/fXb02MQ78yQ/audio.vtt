00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The Earth is a gigantic ball of semi-molten rock with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the sun.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Earth's crust is the only thing in their way.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
It feels solid to us, but it's only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined,

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
subjecting the climate to centuries worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Super volcanoes.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
How big can they get?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And will they put an end to humanity?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Volcanoes.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
There are many types of volcanoes from towering mountains to lava domes, but they have two main sources.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
The first is at the boundaries between tectonic plates, the pieces of the crust that cover the Earth like a giant jigsaw puzzle.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
There are seven major tectonic plates and dozens of smaller ones, drifting against each other at up to 15 centimeters per year.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
This sounds slow, but on geological timescales, it is a titanic struggle over who gets to stay on the surface.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
The winning plate crumples into a new mountain range, while the loser is shoved underneath into an ocean of hot rock at 1,300 degrees Celsius.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
The asthenosphere.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
The temperature here is enough to melt rock into a liquid, but the insane pressures of all that mass keep it a superheated solid.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Tectonic plates are usually in contact with water for thousands of years and absorb some of it.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
When they are submerged into the hot underworld, this water triggers chemical transformations that allow tiny portions to melt into magma.

02:05.000 --> 02:14.000
Liquid magma is less dense than solid rock, so it rises to the surface in furious bubbles that accumulate in sponge-like reservoirs right under the crust.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
If enough magma accumulates, it becomes powerful enough to pierce through the crust, which we experience as volcanoes.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
This happens under the winning plate, like a revenge attack by the loser before it's erased forever.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
The second main source of volcanoes are thought to be mantle plumes.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
These are columns of abnormally hot rock that rise all the way from the planet's core mantle boundary to the surface.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
Much less is known about them, but in a way, it's as if the Earth's mantle has weather patterns and mantle plumes are a little like hot air, rising to form storm clouds.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Storms hundreds of millions of years old, made of rock circulating at a rate of a few millimeters per month.

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
They don't care about the motion of tectonic plates, so they can break the crust to create volcanoes in the middle of nowhere that stubbornly stay active as the crust shifts around them.

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
The volcanic boom meter. Scientists love to put big booms on a scale, and came up with a logarithmic scale that measures the volume ejected during an eruption.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
The volcanic explosivity index, or VEI. Simply put, it starts really small and gets very big very quickly.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
A VEI-2 eruption would fill 400 full Olympic swimming pools with lava. We have around 10 of these per year.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
At VEI-3, we already see devastating effects, like the eruption of the Semaru volcano in 2021, that destroyed thousands of homes in Indonesia.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
At VEI-5, we see catastrophic amounts of materials. Cubic kilometers of debris, equivalent to an entire lake of molten rock blasted into the air.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
Like the 2022 Hongatonga-Hongahapai eruption that sent a shockwave around the globe many times, and created ocean-wide tsunamis.

04:01.000 --> 04:13.000
At a VEI of 6, an eruption can change the world. In 1883, the Indonesian island volcano Krakatoa erupted nearly continuously over the course of five months.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
One of those eruptions blew it apart, producing the loudest sound recorded in history.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Ten trillion times louder than a rocket taking off, heard halfway around the world.

04:23.000 --> 04:33.000
30 meter high tsunamis swept away nearby populations, and so much gas and ash were released that global temperatures cooled by nearly 0.5 degrees Celsius.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Red, dusty sunsets followed for many years.

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
At VEI-7, we get super colossal eruptions. Millennium-defining events that human civilization has only encountered a handful of times.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
Mount Tambora was a 4,300 meter high mountain until it exploded in 1815, and released 400 times more energy than the Tsar Bomba.

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
140 billion tons of ash and dust were shot halfway to space before smothering the world's skies, turning them a sickly yellow.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
There was no summer the following year, crops died, and over 100,000 people perished.

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
This is the dreadful potential of volcanic eruptions, with famines across the other side of the world, and even centuries-long cold periods being attributed to them.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Okay, but what's a supervolcano?

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
The term supervolcano is a media invention, and not a scientific term.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
The main issue with them is that not every eruption from a supervolcano is a super-eruption.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
What makes supervolcanoes special is that they've been waiting to erupt for hundreds of thousands of years.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
Pressure builds up in colossal magma reservoirs several kilometers deep until it becomes strong enough to lift the rock above it by several meters.

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
Rocks crack under the pressure until they finally give way and billions of tons of gas and ash blast out at supersonic speed.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
An insane explosion of at least a thousand cubic kilometers that impacts every corner of the globe.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
And yet, that is only a small portion of the magma reservoir.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Super-eruptions are like a boiling pot of water, popping its lid off and spilling a bit off the top.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Afterwards, the ground collapses into the void left behind, forming a hole called a caldera.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
Under this caldera, pressure starts building again until the volcano gathers enough energy for another super-eruption.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
But this could take hundreds of thousands of years.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
It's estimated that one of the few volcanoes capable of super-eruptions on Earth could cause a catastrophic eruption every 17,000 years on average.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
That would make them far more frequent than comparable asteroid impacts.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
The most recent super-eruption is the Oranui eruption 26,500 years ago in New Zealand.

06:48.000 --> 06:59.000
With the force of dozens of billions of tons of TNT, a Mount Everest-sized pile of explosives, a huge portion of the landscape was scooped out and thrown into the atmosphere.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
It left behind a caldera spanning 20 kilometers, and it caused the entire southern hemisphere to undergo a period of abrupt cooling.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
Though among super-eruptions, it's a mere firework.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
The Lake Toba eruption of 74,000 years ago was a much more significant turning point in history.

07:17.000 --> 07:30.000
It released a gargantuan 5,300 cubic kilometers of material, enough to blanket parts of South Asia in 15 centimeters of ash and trigger a rapid 4 degrees Celsius drop in global temperatures.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
It's possible that the volcanic winter lasted 10 years, followed by worldwide droughts for centuries.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Earth's climate might have not recovered for a thousand years.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
The largest volcanic events we know of were not really huge explosions, but floods of millions of cubic kilometers of lava.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
The grand finale were the Siberian Traps around 250 million years ago, a continuous release of lava for 2 million years.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
They raised the ocean temperatures to over 40 degrees Celsius, which caused the Permian-Triassic extinction, killing over 90% of all species.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Earth's surface needed 9 million years to recover.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
These sorts of eruptions don't change the climate, they are the climate.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
But thankfully, we haven't seen anything even remotely close to that scale in many millions of years.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
So, should you be scared of supervolcanoes? Definitely not.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
They've been used to frighten many people, and are overhyped as an unavoidable apocalypse.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
The most famous one, Yellowstone, will erupt again, but they will be relatively small eruptions.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
Natural disasters for sure, but not enough to devastate the US or come close to ending humanity.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
The chance of a VEI-8 eruption in the next few hundred years is less than 2%, and more importantly, it wouldn't come as a sudden surprise.

08:52.000 --> 09:01.000
However, less powerful but more frequent eruptions can also do serious damage to our civilizations, and are in many ways a much greater concern.

09:01.000 --> 09:12.000
So, we must watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs, like ground swelling and temperature increases, to get an early warning that can save the lives of people living the closest to a volcano.

09:12.000 --> 09:22.000
And, there's time to develop solutions that can remove sulfur and ash from the stratosphere to eliminate the root cause of the climate disruption we've seen from previous eruptions.

09:22.000 --> 09:32.000
Who knows, maybe we'll even be able to turn this force of destruction into an agent for good by exploiting the geothermal energy held in their giant magma reservoirs.

09:32.000 --> 09:43.000
We've done this work for so many other disasters, and we are already doing things we could only have dreamed about decades ago, like sending a probe to perform our first asteroid redirection test.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
With determination, humanity really can solve anything.

09:48.000 --> 09:56.000
So, while deep below us an angry hell is churning, and waiting for its moment, you can sleep well tonight.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
Learning how we can get ahead of catastrophes like climate change and supervolcanoes is interesting, but can also be challenging.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Maybe you still feel like you don't really understand how most of the science behind it works.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
And, on your own, it seems too hard to dig deeper.

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
