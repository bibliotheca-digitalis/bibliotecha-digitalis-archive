0	8000	Matter as we know it. Atoms, stars and galaxies. Planets and trees. Rocks and us.
8000	12500	This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.
12500	20500	About 25% is dark matter and 70% dark energy, both of which are invisible.
20500	28500	This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is really only a tiny fraction of reality.
28500	34500	But it gets worse. We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are or how they work.
34500	39000	We are pretty sure they exist though. So, what do we know?
46000	50500	Dark matter is the stuff that makes it possible for galaxies to exist.
50500	58000	When we calculated why the universe is structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there's just not enough normal matter.
58000	64000	The gravity of the visible matter is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures.
64000	69000	Stars would more likely be scattered all over the place and not form galaxies.
69000	73000	So we know there is something else inside and around them.
73000	78000	Something that doesn't emit or reflect light. Something dark.
78000	84500	But besides being able to calculate the existence of dark matter, we can see it, kind of.
84500	89500	Places with a high concentration of dark matter bend light passing nearby.
89500	93000	So we know there's something there that interacts with gravity.
93000	99500	Right now, we have more ideas about what dark energy is not than what it is.
99500	106500	We know dark matter is not just clouds of normal matter without stars because it would emit particles we could detect.
106500	113500	Dark matter is not antimatter because antimatter produces unique gamma rays when it reacts with normal matter.
113500	121000	Dark matter is also not made up of black holes, very compact objects that violently affect their surroundings,
121000	125000	while dark matter seems to be scattered all over the place.
125000	128000	Basically, we only know three things for sure.
128000	130500	One, something is out there.
130500	133000	Two, it interacts with gravity.
133000	136000	Three, there is a lot of it.
136000	143500	Dark matter is probably made up of a complicated exotic particle that doesn't interact with light and matter in a way we expect,
143500	146000	but right now, we just don't know.
146000	149500	Dark energy is even more strange and mysterious.
149500	154000	We can't detect it, we can't measure it, and we can't taste it.
154000	157000	But we do see its effects very clearly.
157000	163000	In 1929, Edwin Hubble examined how the wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies
163000	168500	shifts towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum as it travels through space.
168500	174500	He found that fainter, more distant galaxies showed a large degree of redshift.
174500	177000	Closer galaxies, not so much.
177000	181500	Hubble determined that this was because the universe itself is expanding.
181500	188000	The redshift occurs because the wavelengths of light are stretched as the universe expands.
188000	193000	More recent discoveries have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
193000	198000	Before that, it was thought that the pull of gravity would cause the expansion to either slow down
198000	201500	or even retract and collapse in on itself at some point.
201500	205000	Space doesn't change its properties as it expands.
205000	207000	There's just more of it.
207000	210000	New space is constantly created everywhere.
210000	214500	Galaxies are tight-bound clusters of stuff held together by gravity
214500	220000	so we don't experience this expansion in our daily lives, but we see it everywhere around us.
220000	225000	Wherever there is empty space in the universe, more is forming every second.
225000	230000	So dark energy seems to be some kind of energy intrinsic to empty space.
230000	236000	Energy that is stronger than anything else we know and that keeps getting stronger as time passes by.
236000	242000	Empty space has more energy than everything else in the universe combined.
242000	246000	We have multiple ideas about what dark energy might be.
246000	252000	One idea is that dark energy is not a thing, but just a property of space.
252000	255500	Empty space is not nothing, it has its own energy.
255500	258500	It can generate more space and is quite active.
258500	265000	So as the universe expands, it could be that just more and more space appears to fill the gaps
265000	269000	and this leads to a faster, expanding universe.
269000	273000	This idea is close to an idea that Einstein had back in 1917
273000	278500	of a concept of a cosmological constant, a force that counteracted the force of gravity.
278500	282500	The only problem is that when we tried to calculate the amount of this energy,
282500	287500	the result was so wrong and weird that it only added to the confusion.
287500	292500	Another idea is that empty space is actually full of temporary, virtual particles
292500	298500	that spontaneously and continually form from nothing and then disappear into nothing again.
298500	302000	The energy from those particles could be dark energy.
302000	307000	Or maybe dark energy is an unknown kind of dynamic energy fluid or field
307000	314000	which permeates the entire universe, but somehow has the opposite effect on the universe than normal energy and matter.
314000	319000	But if it exists, we don't know how and where or how we could detect it.
319000	322500	So there are still a lot of questions to answer.
322500	327500	Our theories about dark matter and dark energy are still just that, theories.
327500	330500	On the one hand, this is kind of frustrating.
330500	334500	On the other hand, this is frontier science, making it very exciting.
334500	337500	It shows us that no matter how much we feel we're on top of things,
337500	342500	we're still very much apes with smartphones, on a tiny, fragile island in space,
342500	346500	looking into the sky, wondering how our universe works.
346500	352000	There is so much left to learn, and that is awesome.
