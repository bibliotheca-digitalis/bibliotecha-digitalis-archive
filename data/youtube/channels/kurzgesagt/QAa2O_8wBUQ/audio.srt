1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Matter as we know it. Atoms, stars and galaxies. Planets and trees. Rocks and us.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,500
This matter accounts for less than 5% of the known universe.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,500
About 25% is dark matter and 70% dark energy, both of which are invisible.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,500
This is kind of strange because it suggests that everything we experience is really only a tiny fraction of reality.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,500
But it gets worse. We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are or how they work.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
We are pretty sure they exist though. So, what do we know?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Dark matter is the stuff that makes it possible for galaxies to exist.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,000
When we calculated why the universe is structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there's just not enough normal matter.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The gravity of the visible matter is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Stars would more likely be scattered all over the place and not form galaxies.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we know there is something else inside and around them.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Something that doesn't emit or reflect light. Something dark.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,500
But besides being able to calculate the existence of dark matter, we can see it, kind of.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Places with a high concentration of dark matter bend light passing nearby.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,000
So we know there's something there that interacts with gravity.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Right now, we have more ideas about what dark energy is not than what it is.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,500
We know dark matter is not just clouds of normal matter without stars because it would emit particles we could detect.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Dark matter is not antimatter because antimatter produces unique gamma rays when it reacts with normal matter.

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Dark matter is also not made up of black holes, very compact objects that violently affect their surroundings,

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
while dark matter seems to be scattered all over the place.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Basically, we only know three things for sure.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,500
One, something is out there.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Two, it interacts with gravity.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Three, there is a lot of it.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,500
Dark matter is probably made up of a complicated exotic particle that doesn't interact with light and matter in a way we expect,

26
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
but right now, we just don't know.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Dark energy is even more strange and mysterious.

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,000
We can't detect it, we can't measure it, and we can't taste it.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But we do see its effects very clearly.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In 1929, Edwin Hubble examined how the wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,500
shifts towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum as it travels through space.

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,500
He found that fainter, more distant galaxies showed a large degree of redshift.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,000
Closer galaxies, not so much.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Hubble determined that this was because the universe itself is expanding.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,000
The redshift occurs because the wavelengths of light are stretched as the universe expands.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
More recent discoveries have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Before that, it was thought that the pull of gravity would cause the expansion to either slow down

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
or even retract and collapse in on itself at some point.

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Space doesn't change its properties as it expands.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's just more of it.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
New space is constantly created everywhere.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Galaxies are tight-bound clusters of stuff held together by gravity

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,000
so we don't experience this expansion in our daily lives, but we see it everywhere around us.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Wherever there is empty space in the universe, more is forming every second.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So dark energy seems to be some kind of energy intrinsic to empty space.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Energy that is stronger than anything else we know and that keeps getting stronger as time passes by.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Empty space has more energy than everything else in the universe combined.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We have multiple ideas about what dark energy might be.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
One idea is that dark energy is not a thing, but just a property of space.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Empty space is not nothing, it has its own energy.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
It can generate more space and is quite active.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,000
So as the universe expands, it could be that just more and more space appears to fill the gaps

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and this leads to a faster, expanding universe.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This idea is close to an idea that Einstein had back in 1917

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,500
of a concept of a cosmological constant, a force that counteracted the force of gravity.

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,500
The only problem is that when we tried to calculate the amount of this energy,

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
the result was so wrong and weird that it only added to the confusion.

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Another idea is that empty space is actually full of temporary, virtual particles

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,500
that spontaneously and continually form from nothing and then disappear into nothing again.

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,000
The energy from those particles could be dark energy.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Or maybe dark energy is an unknown kind of dynamic energy fluid or field

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
which permeates the entire universe, but somehow has the opposite effect on the universe than normal energy and matter.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But if it exists, we don't know how and where or how we could detect it.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,500
So there are still a lot of questions to answer.

65
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Our theories about dark matter and dark energy are still just that, theories.

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
On the one hand, this is kind of frustrating.

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
On the other hand, this is frontier science, making it very exciting.

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It shows us that no matter how much we feel we're on top of things,

69
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,500
we're still very much apes with smartphones, on a tiny, fragile island in space,

70
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
looking into the sky, wondering how our universe works.

71
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,000
There is so much left to learn, and that is awesome.
