0	4000	The internet is like a breeding ground for conspiracy theories.
4000	9520	While some are just stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust.
9520	15360	So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all,
15360	17680	but a lot of conspiracy theories.
17680	18960	It's really simple.
18960	23680	Just ask yourself, does the theory affect really rich and powerful people?
23680	25280	Is the answer yes?
25280	28560	Okay, then it's most likely not true.
28560	30480	Let's test it on three examples.
37040	38080	Number one.
38080	39440	There's an easy cure for cancer,
39440	42480	but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies.
43920	46560	Do really rich people die of cancer?
46560	50000	Like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple?
50720	54640	Yes, there is no suppressed cure for cancer.
55440	57440	Number two, chemtrails.
57440	62080	The theory that airplanes spray chemicals in the air for population control
62080	63600	or some other crazy reason.
63600	66080	Do really powerful people breathe air?
66080	68160	Do Obama or Putin breathe air?
69120	72000	Yes, chemtrails are not a thing.
72560	75520	Number three, apocalyptic conspiracy theories.
76080	81520	The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Myers, aliens, someone says so.
82080	86640	Do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon-to-be-upon-us and very imminent apocalypse?
87280	90720	Yes, the world will not end soon.
90720	94080	This obviously doesn't work for every conspiracy theory out there,
94080	96480	but it does work for some of the most stupid ones.
96480	100800	So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in your water,
100800	102080	just show them this video,
102080	105840	and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook.
116640	122400	Thanks for watching!
