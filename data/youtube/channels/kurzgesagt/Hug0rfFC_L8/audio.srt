1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The internet is like a breeding ground for conspiracy theories.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,520
While some are just stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,360
So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,680
but a lot of conspiracy theories.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,960
It's really simple.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
Just ask yourself, does the theory affect really rich and powerful people?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,280
Is the answer yes?

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,560
Okay, then it's most likely not true.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
Let's test it on three examples.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,080
Number one.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,440
There's an easy cure for cancer,

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,480
but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Do really rich people die of cancer?

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,000
Like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,640
Yes, there is no suppressed cure for cancer.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Number two, chemtrails.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,080
The theory that airplanes spray chemicals in the air for population control

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,600
or some other crazy reason.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
Do really powerful people breathe air?

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,160
Do Obama or Putin breathe air?

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, chemtrails are not a thing.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Number three, apocalyptic conspiracy theories.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,520
The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Myers, aliens, someone says so.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,640
Do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon-to-be-upon-us and very imminent apocalypse?

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
Yes, the world will not end soon.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,080
This obviously doesn't work for every conspiracy theory out there,

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,480
but it does work for some of the most stupid ones.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,800
So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in your water,

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,080
just show them this video,

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,840
and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Thanks for watching!
