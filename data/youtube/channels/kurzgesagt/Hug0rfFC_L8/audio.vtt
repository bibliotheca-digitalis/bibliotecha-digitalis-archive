The internet is like a breeding ground for conspiracy theories.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.520
While some are just stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust.

00:09.520 --> 00:15.360
So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all,

00:15.360 --> 00:17.680
but a lot of conspiracy theories.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.960
It's really simple.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.680
Just ask yourself, does the theory affect really rich and powerful people?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.280
Is the answer yes?

00:25.280 --> 00:28.560
Okay, then it's most likely not true.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.480
Let's test it on three examples.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.080
Number one.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.440
There's an easy cure for cancer,

00:39.440 --> 00:42.480
but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.560
Do really rich people die of cancer?

00:46.560 --> 00:50.000
Like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple?

00:50.720 --> 00:54.640
Yes, there is no suppressed cure for cancer.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.440
Number two, chemtrails.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.080
The theory that airplanes spray chemicals in the air for population control

01:02.080 --> 01:03.600
or some other crazy reason.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.080
Do really powerful people breathe air?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.160
Do Obama or Putin breathe air?

01:09.120 --> 01:12.000
Yes, chemtrails are not a thing.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.520
Number three, apocalyptic conspiracy theories.

01:16.080 --> 01:21.520
The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Myers, aliens, someone says so.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.640
Do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon-to-be-upon-us and very imminent apocalypse?

01:27.280 --> 01:30.720
Yes, the world will not end soon.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.080
This obviously doesn't work for every conspiracy theory out there,

01:34.080 --> 01:36.480
but it does work for some of the most stupid ones.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.800
So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in your water,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.080
just show them this video,

01:42.080 --> 01:45.840
and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook.

01:56.640 --> 02:02.400
Thanks for watching!
