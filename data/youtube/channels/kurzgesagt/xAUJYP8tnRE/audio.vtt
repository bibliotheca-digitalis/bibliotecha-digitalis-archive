00:00.000 --> 00:07.780
The universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable

00:07.780 --> 00:13.200
planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars,

00:13.200 --> 00:19.960
at just 0.1% of the speed of light, it could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years.

00:19.960 --> 00:26.400
Which is not that long given the billions of years the Milky Way has existed, so in principle,

00:26.400 --> 00:32.160
any space-faring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy.

00:32.160 --> 00:39.480
And yet, we see nothing, hear nothing. The universe seems empty, devoid of others.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.920
This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.

00:43.920 --> 00:51.540
Confronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want

00:51.540 --> 00:56.860
to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone

00:56.860 --> 01:03.100
watching, but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty.

01:03.100 --> 01:09.740
Maybe it's full of civilizations, but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations

01:09.740 --> 01:16.180
that attracted attention in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the

01:16.180 --> 01:18.540
Dark Forest Solution to the Fermi Paradox.

01:18.540 --> 01:28.700
The Way of Life

01:28.700 --> 01:34.980
The hunter awakes in his hiding place and carefully listens for suspicious

01:34.980 --> 01:40.900
noises from the thick undergrowth before he gets up. Another night has passed without

01:40.900 --> 01:48.860
incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end his

01:48.860 --> 01:54.060
loneliness, but stops himself at the last moment. What if they are like him?

01:54.060 --> 02:02.980
All living things seek to survive, secure resources, and multiply. Their greatest

02:02.980 --> 02:08.100
obstacle are other living things that share the same objective. Competition between species

02:08.300 --> 02:14.500
favored the survival of beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,

02:14.500 --> 02:19.860
expansionist, and greedy for resources, which led them to winning the competition for our planet.

02:19.860 --> 02:26.340
Today, most other animals are so utterly at our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a

02:26.340 --> 02:32.900
day, just as an unintentional byproduct of how we like to run things. But humans are more than

02:32.900 --> 02:39.300
individuals. From us, cultures emerge that also compete with each other. Competitive and

02:39.300 --> 02:46.660
expansionary cultures spread faster and further, and merge with, subdue, or destroy others. If we

02:46.660 --> 02:53.060
look at our history, it becomes clear we are dangerous. Not just to others, but also to

02:53.060 --> 02:59.780
ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over every corner of our planet, and soon we will

02:59.780 --> 03:06.820
look to the stars, both to expand our domain and ensure access to ever more resources. And then we

03:06.820 --> 03:13.460
might stumble upon others trying to do the same thing. It's likely that the competition of life

03:13.460 --> 03:20.180
also takes place on faraway planets, so it's logical to assume that an alien civilization

03:20.180 --> 03:26.220
that came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us. But if they're similar

03:26.220 --> 03:37.260
to us, they too may be dangerous. The implication. As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest

03:37.260 --> 03:43.900
all alone, he knows that there might be others like him. He can't know their intentions, if they

03:43.900 --> 03:51.340
are aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his own survival, so he has to

03:51.340 --> 03:59.420
assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another hunter, the one that

03:59.420 --> 04:07.980
shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far, the progress

04:07.980 --> 04:13.740
of the modern world seems to have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true

04:13.740 --> 04:19.260
for other civilizations too, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more.

04:20.220 --> 04:26.140
Different alien civilizations also should vary from the mild and peaceful, to the malevolent

04:26.140 --> 04:32.460
and militaristic. The existential problem we're facing is that when we meet others between the

04:32.460 --> 04:37.980
stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or aggressive, and what their true intentions are.

04:38.860 --> 04:43.980
Similarly, they might not understand or trust our intentions, even if we tell them that we

04:43.980 --> 04:50.220
are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another civilization and they discovered us,

04:50.220 --> 04:53.660
the light years between us would mean years of communication delay.

04:54.540 --> 05:00.060
Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty, wondering if the wisest move is to just attack,

05:00.060 --> 05:04.700
because there's another serious issue, technological explosions, and the first

05:04.700 --> 05:10.940
strike advantage. We don't know where the limits of technology are, but we do know how much

05:10.940 --> 05:16.940
technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict

05:16.940 --> 05:24.140
with uncertain results into a one-sided massacre. Caesar's legions would stand no chance against

05:24.140 --> 05:29.980
Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets, which would be eradicated by artillery from the

05:29.980 --> 05:35.260
First World War, which would not stand a chance against today's drones and guided missiles.

05:36.220 --> 05:41.580
So the power level of different civilizations may vary massively, and even if not, between the

05:41.580 --> 05:47.180
time it takes us to detect another civilization and us saying, hi, we might already be hopelessly

05:47.180 --> 05:52.780
behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar conflict makes this

05:52.780 --> 05:59.420
worse. If your opponent is light years away, sending an invasion fleet takes so long that

05:59.500 --> 06:06.860
by the time it arrives, it might be hopelessly obsolete. So war between civilizations might be

06:06.860 --> 06:12.540
just about eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself, someone else who

06:12.540 --> 06:18.460
might be so scared of you that they attack the first chance they get. In this environment,

06:18.460 --> 06:23.820
the only way to guarantee a win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance

06:23.820 --> 06:30.300
of survival or time to counterattack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest

06:30.300 --> 06:36.540
possible with no room for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations live on planets,

06:36.540 --> 06:41.340
that leaves them pretty vulnerable. All you need to do is throw something massive at a planet to

06:41.340 --> 06:46.620
make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation weapon is probably

06:46.620 --> 06:52.460
something like a relativistic kill vehicle, a missile shot at a planet at a significant fraction

06:52.460 --> 06:59.340
of the speed of light. For example, a missile the size of a person going 95% the speed of light

06:59.340 --> 07:05.260
has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on Earth. If you shot a few dozen of the civilization you

07:05.260 --> 07:10.220
wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain even a single hit would suffice.

07:11.500 --> 07:18.460
This is not that absurd of an idea. A civilization only slightly above us on the Kardashev scale

07:18.460 --> 07:23.500
would have enough energy to send multiple strikes against every planet it suspects of harboring life.

07:24.700 --> 07:29.500
What makes these weapons so sinister is how much they favor a first strike,

07:29.500 --> 07:34.060
since they would be so fast that it might be impossible to protect yourself effectively

07:34.060 --> 07:39.580
against them once they're launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be lengthy affairs,

07:39.580 --> 07:43.740
but rapid winner-takes-all situations, where the first one to shoot wins.

07:44.700 --> 07:51.980
This makes any civilization an existential threat to any other. And if every civilization is an

07:51.980 --> 07:57.340
existential threat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there.

07:58.220 --> 08:05.340
Quiet ones and dead ones. So what should we do? Should we worry?

08:06.140 --> 08:11.740
It's unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity yet. The radio signals we've transmitted in the

08:11.740 --> 08:17.260
last 100 years traveled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable

08:17.260 --> 08:23.420
noise. At our technological stage, if we don't actively try to get noticed, and if nobody

08:23.420 --> 08:29.260
specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable solar system, we'll stay hidden. But one day

08:29.260 --> 08:34.940
we will venture into space in a serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again.

08:36.060 --> 08:40.380
We don't know if there are others or if we are going through the forest alone.

08:41.100 --> 08:46.060
But we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can do

08:46.060 --> 08:51.820
is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing and make themselves known,

08:51.820 --> 08:55.980
we should not reply right away, but carefully watch them from the undergrowth.

08:56.620 --> 09:02.140
Perhaps we are also thinking about this all wrong by allowing our primitive brain that evolved in

09:02.140 --> 09:07.420
the context of the gruesome competition of life to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us.

09:08.300 --> 09:12.940
Maybe the fact that we are looking at the universe like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet

09:12.940 --> 09:18.780
as a species. There could be a friendly, welcoming community of alien civilizations waiting to hear

09:18.780 --> 09:24.700
from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually little we need to do.

09:25.260 --> 09:29.020
We just need to be thoughtful about the signals we send out into the galaxy,

09:29.020 --> 09:35.820
we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our forest. Because whatever the

09:35.820 --> 09:42.620
nature of our forest is, full of dangers or friends, or nobody at all, only careful

09:42.620 --> 09:52.060
observation can tell. So, let's do that. At last, the hunter reaches a clearing and

09:52.060 --> 09:59.820
finds a comfortable position. Slowly, the sun melts the fog away. Lost in thought,

10:00.460 --> 10:07.340
he admires the vegetation until suddenly he is eye to eye with another hunter,

10:07.340 --> 10:14.700
frozen in terror just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different options.

10:16.060 --> 10:24.780
The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a decision. Maybe the only way out of the dark

10:24.860 --> 10:28.780
forest is to step into the clearing, together.

10:30.620 --> 10:37.100
And with this hopeful picture, we say goodbye to the year 12,021 of the human era.

10:37.100 --> 10:42.060
It was a wild year to say the least, still much more fun than 12,020.

10:42.060 --> 10:47.740
Kurzgesagt had its most successful month ever and published a book. We tried a lot of new techniques

10:47.740 --> 10:52.620
and already got into Blender and Cinema 4D, hiding more and more 3D in our videos.

10:53.420 --> 10:58.700
We have so many ideas for next year and big and ambitious plans that we can't

10:58.700 --> 11:05.340
wait to share with you. And all of this was and is possible because of your direct support.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.740
Thank you so much. Kurzgesagt only works because of you.

11:10.620 --> 11:14.940
So, in tune with the end of the year, we've designed a few products that will help you

11:14.940 --> 11:20.620
to visualize your place in the universe. Our very shiny The Night Sky poster shows

11:20.620 --> 11:25.580
you the little piece of space we can see from Earth with our own eyes, or travel further out

11:25.580 --> 11:30.060
with our stellar Zoom collection that depicts our home in space from an increasing distance,

11:30.940 --> 11:38.060
or dream with our space-themed notebooks, scenic posters, and pens. We design and produce every

11:38.060 --> 11:43.020
single product with great care. Getting something from our shop is the best way to support

11:43.020 --> 11:49.740
Kurzgesagt. We hope you have a wonderful end of the year and that 12,022 is more fun and

11:49.740 --> 12:03.900
less exciting than the last two years. Thank you for watching.
