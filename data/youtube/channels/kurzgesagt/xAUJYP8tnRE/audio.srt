1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,780
The universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,200
planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,960
at just 0.1% of the speed of light, it could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,400
Which is not that long given the billions of years the Milky Way has existed, so in principle,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,160
any space-faring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,480
And yet, we see nothing, hear nothing. The universe seems empty, devoid of others.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,920
This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,540
Confronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,860
to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:03,100
watching, but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty.

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,740
Maybe it's full of civilizations, but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations

12
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,180
that attracted attention in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the

13
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,540
Dark Forest Solution to the Fermi Paradox.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:28,700
The Way of Life

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,980
The hunter awakes in his hiding place and carefully listens for suspicious

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,900
noises from the thick undergrowth before he gets up. Another night has passed without

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,860
incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end his

18
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,060
loneliness, but stops himself at the last moment. What if they are like him?

19
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,980
All living things seek to survive, secure resources, and multiply. Their greatest

20
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,100
obstacle are other living things that share the same objective. Competition between species

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,500
favored the survival of beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,860
expansionist, and greedy for resources, which led them to winning the competition for our planet.

23
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,340
Today, most other animals are so utterly at our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a

24
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,900
day, just as an unintentional byproduct of how we like to run things. But humans are more than

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,300
individuals. From us, cultures emerge that also compete with each other. Competitive and

26
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,660
expansionary cultures spread faster and further, and merge with, subdue, or destroy others. If we

27
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,060
look at our history, it becomes clear we are dangerous. Not just to others, but also to

28
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,780
ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over every corner of our planet, and soon we will

29
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,820
look to the stars, both to expand our domain and ensure access to ever more resources. And then we

30
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,460
might stumble upon others trying to do the same thing. It's likely that the competition of life

31
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,180
also takes place on faraway planets, so it's logical to assume that an alien civilization

32
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,220
that came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us. But if they're similar

33
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:37,260
to us, they too may be dangerous. The implication. As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,900
all alone, he knows that there might be others like him. He can't know their intentions, if they

35
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,340
are aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his own survival, so he has to

36
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,420
assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another hunter, the one that

37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:07,980
shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far, the progress

38
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,740
of the modern world seems to have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true

39
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,260
for other civilizations too, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more.

40
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,140
Different alien civilizations also should vary from the mild and peaceful, to the malevolent

41
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,460
and militaristic. The existential problem we're facing is that when we meet others between the

42
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,980
stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or aggressive, and what their true intentions are.

43
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,980
Similarly, they might not understand or trust our intentions, even if we tell them that we

44
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,220
are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another civilization and they discovered us,

45
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,660
the light years between us would mean years of communication delay.

46
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,060
Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty, wondering if the wisest move is to just attack,

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,700
because there's another serious issue, technological explosions, and the first

48
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,940
strike advantage. We don't know where the limits of technology are, but we do know how much

49
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,940
technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict

50
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:24,140
with uncertain results into a one-sided massacre. Caesar's legions would stand no chance against

51
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,980
Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets, which would be eradicated by artillery from the

52
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,260
First World War, which would not stand a chance against today's drones and guided missiles.

53
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,580
So the power level of different civilizations may vary massively, and even if not, between the

54
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,180
time it takes us to detect another civilization and us saying, hi, we might already be hopelessly

55
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,780
behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar conflict makes this

56
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:59,420
worse. If your opponent is light years away, sending an invasion fleet takes so long that

57
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,860
by the time it arrives, it might be hopelessly obsolete. So war between civilizations might be

58
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,540
just about eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself, someone else who

59
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,460
might be so scared of you that they attack the first chance they get. In this environment,

60
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,820
the only way to guarantee a win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance

61
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,300
of survival or time to counterattack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest

62
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,540
possible with no room for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations live on planets,

63
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,340
that leaves them pretty vulnerable. All you need to do is throw something massive at a planet to

64
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,620
make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation weapon is probably

65
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,460
something like a relativistic kill vehicle, a missile shot at a planet at a significant fraction

66
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,340
of the speed of light. For example, a missile the size of a person going 95% the speed of light

67
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,260
has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on Earth. If you shot a few dozen of the civilization you

68
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,220
wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain even a single hit would suffice.

69
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,460
This is not that absurd of an idea. A civilization only slightly above us on the Kardashev scale

70
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,500
would have enough energy to send multiple strikes against every planet it suspects of harboring life.

71
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,500
What makes these weapons so sinister is how much they favor a first strike,

72
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,060
since they would be so fast that it might be impossible to protect yourself effectively

73
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,580
against them once they're launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be lengthy affairs,

74
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,740
but rapid winner-takes-all situations, where the first one to shoot wins.

75
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,980
This makes any civilization an existential threat to any other. And if every civilization is an

76
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,340
existential threat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there.

77
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,340
Quiet ones and dead ones. So what should we do? Should we worry?

78
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,740
It's unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity yet. The radio signals we've transmitted in the

79
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,260
last 100 years traveled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable

80
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,420
noise. At our technological stage, if we don't actively try to get noticed, and if nobody

81
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,260
specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable solar system, we'll stay hidden. But one day

82
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,940
we will venture into space in a serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again.

83
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,380
We don't know if there are others or if we are going through the forest alone.

84
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,060
But we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can do

85
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,820
is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing and make themselves known,

86
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,980
we should not reply right away, but carefully watch them from the undergrowth.

87
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,140
Perhaps we are also thinking about this all wrong by allowing our primitive brain that evolved in

88
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,420
the context of the gruesome competition of life to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us.

89
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,940
Maybe the fact that we are looking at the universe like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet

90
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,780
as a species. There could be a friendly, welcoming community of alien civilizations waiting to hear

91
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,700
from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually little we need to do.

92
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,020
We just need to be thoughtful about the signals we send out into the galaxy,

93
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,820
we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our forest. Because whatever the

94
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,620
nature of our forest is, full of dangers or friends, or nobody at all, only careful

95
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:52,060
observation can tell. So, let's do that. At last, the hunter reaches a clearing and

96
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,820
finds a comfortable position. Slowly, the sun melts the fog away. Lost in thought,

97
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:07,340
he admires the vegetation until suddenly he is eye to eye with another hunter,

98
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:14,700
frozen in terror just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different options.

99
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:24,780
The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a decision. Maybe the only way out of the dark

100
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,780
forest is to step into the clearing, together.

101
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,100
And with this hopeful picture, we say goodbye to the year 12,021 of the human era.

102
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,060
It was a wild year to say the least, still much more fun than 12,020.

103
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,740
Kurzgesagt had its most successful month ever and published a book. We tried a lot of new techniques

104
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,620
and already got into Blender and Cinema 4D, hiding more and more 3D in our videos.

105
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,700
We have so many ideas for next year and big and ambitious plans that we can't

106
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,340
wait to share with you. And all of this was and is possible because of your direct support.

107
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,740
Thank you so much. Kurzgesagt only works because of you.

108
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,940
So, in tune with the end of the year, we've designed a few products that will help you

109
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,620
to visualize your place in the universe. Our very shiny The Night Sky poster shows

110
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,580
you the little piece of space we can see from Earth with our own eyes, or travel further out

111
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,060
with our stellar Zoom collection that depicts our home in space from an increasing distance,

112
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:38,060
or dream with our space-themed notebooks, scenic posters, and pens. We design and produce every

113
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,020
single product with great care. Getting something from our shop is the best way to support

114
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,740
Kurzgesagt. We hope you have a wonderful end of the year and that 12,022 is more fun and

115
00:11:49,740 --> 00:12:03,900
less exciting than the last two years. Thank you for watching.
