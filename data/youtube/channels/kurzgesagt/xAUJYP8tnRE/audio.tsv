0	7780	The universe is incredibly big and seems full of potential for life, with billions of habitable
7780	13200	planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology to travel between the stars,
13200	19960	at just 0.1% of the speed of light, it could colonize our galaxy in roughly 100 million years.
19960	26400	Which is not that long given the billions of years the Milky Way has existed, so in principle,
26400	32160	any space-faring civilization should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy.
32160	39480	And yet, we see nothing, hear nothing. The universe seems empty, devoid of others.
39480	43920	This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed in more detail in other videos.
43920	51540	Confronted with the seemingly empty universe, humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want
51540	56860	to know if we are alone in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to anyone
56860	63100	watching, but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty.
63100	69740	Maybe it's full of civilizations, but they are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations
69740	76180	that attracted attention in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the
76180	78540	Dark Forest Solution to the Fermi Paradox.
78540	88700	The Way of Life
88700	94980	The hunter awakes in his hiding place and carefully listens for suspicious
94980	100900	noises from the thick undergrowth before he gets up. Another night has passed without
100900	108860	incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end his
108860	114060	loneliness, but stops himself at the last moment. What if they are like him?
114060	122980	All living things seek to survive, secure resources, and multiply. Their greatest
122980	128100	obstacle are other living things that share the same objective. Competition between species
128300	134500	favored the survival of beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,
134500	139860	expansionist, and greedy for resources, which led them to winning the competition for our planet.
139860	146340	Today, most other animals are so utterly at our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a
146340	152900	day, just as an unintentional byproduct of how we like to run things. But humans are more than
152900	159300	individuals. From us, cultures emerge that also compete with each other. Competitive and
159300	166660	expansionary cultures spread faster and further, and merge with, subdue, or destroy others. If we
166660	173060	look at our history, it becomes clear we are dangerous. Not just to others, but also to
173060	179780	ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over every corner of our planet, and soon we will
179780	186820	look to the stars, both to expand our domain and ensure access to ever more resources. And then we
186820	193460	might stumble upon others trying to do the same thing. It's likely that the competition of life
193460	200180	also takes place on faraway planets, so it's logical to assume that an alien civilization
200180	206220	that came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us. But if they're similar
206220	217260	to us, they too may be dangerous. The implication. As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest
217260	223900	all alone, he knows that there might be others like him. He can't know their intentions, if they
223900	231340	are aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his own survival, so he has to
231340	239420	assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another hunter, the one that
239420	247980	shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far, the progress
247980	253740	of the modern world seems to have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true
253740	259260	for other civilizations too, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more.
260220	266140	Different alien civilizations also should vary from the mild and peaceful, to the malevolent
266140	272460	and militaristic. The existential problem we're facing is that when we meet others between the
272460	277980	stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or aggressive, and what their true intentions are.
278860	283980	Similarly, they might not understand or trust our intentions, even if we tell them that we
283980	290220	are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another civilization and they discovered us,
290220	293660	the light years between us would mean years of communication delay.
294540	300060	Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty, wondering if the wisest move is to just attack,
300060	304700	because there's another serious issue, technological explosions, and the first
304700	310940	strike advantage. We don't know where the limits of technology are, but we do know how much
310940	316940	technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict
316940	324140	with uncertain results into a one-sided massacre. Caesar's legions would stand no chance against
324140	329980	Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets, which would be eradicated by artillery from the
329980	335260	First World War, which would not stand a chance against today's drones and guided missiles.
336220	341580	So the power level of different civilizations may vary massively, and even if not, between the
341580	347180	time it takes us to detect another civilization and us saying, hi, we might already be hopelessly
347180	352780	behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar conflict makes this
352780	359420	worse. If your opponent is light years away, sending an invasion fleet takes so long that
359500	366860	by the time it arrives, it might be hopelessly obsolete. So war between civilizations might be
366860	372540	just about eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself, someone else who
372540	378460	might be so scared of you that they attack the first chance they get. In this environment,
378460	383820	the only way to guarantee a win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance
383820	390300	of survival or time to counterattack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest
390300	396540	possible with no room for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations live on planets,
396540	401340	that leaves them pretty vulnerable. All you need to do is throw something massive at a planet to
401340	406620	make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation weapon is probably
406620	412460	something like a relativistic kill vehicle, a missile shot at a planet at a significant fraction
412460	419340	of the speed of light. For example, a missile the size of a person going 95% the speed of light
419340	425260	has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on Earth. If you shot a few dozen of the civilization you
425260	430220	wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain even a single hit would suffice.
431500	438460	This is not that absurd of an idea. A civilization only slightly above us on the Kardashev scale
438460	443500	would have enough energy to send multiple strikes against every planet it suspects of harboring life.
444700	449500	What makes these weapons so sinister is how much they favor a first strike,
449500	454060	since they would be so fast that it might be impossible to protect yourself effectively
454060	459580	against them once they're launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be lengthy affairs,
459580	463740	but rapid winner-takes-all situations, where the first one to shoot wins.
464700	471980	This makes any civilization an existential threat to any other. And if every civilization is an
471980	477340	existential threat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there.
478220	485340	Quiet ones and dead ones. So what should we do? Should we worry?
486140	491740	It's unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity yet. The radio signals we've transmitted in the
491740	497260	last 100 years traveled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable
497260	503420	noise. At our technological stage, if we don't actively try to get noticed, and if nobody
503420	509260	specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable solar system, we'll stay hidden. But one day
509260	514940	we will venture into space in a serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again.
516060	520380	We don't know if there are others or if we are going through the forest alone.
521100	526060	But we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can do
526060	531820	is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing and make themselves known,
531820	535980	we should not reply right away, but carefully watch them from the undergrowth.
536620	542140	Perhaps we are also thinking about this all wrong by allowing our primitive brain that evolved in
542140	547420	the context of the gruesome competition of life to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us.
548300	552940	Maybe the fact that we are looking at the universe like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet
552940	558780	as a species. There could be a friendly, welcoming community of alien civilizations waiting to hear
558780	564700	from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually little we need to do.
565260	569020	We just need to be thoughtful about the signals we send out into the galaxy,
569020	575820	we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our forest. Because whatever the
575820	582620	nature of our forest is, full of dangers or friends, or nobody at all, only careful
582620	592060	observation can tell. So, let's do that. At last, the hunter reaches a clearing and
592060	599820	finds a comfortable position. Slowly, the sun melts the fog away. Lost in thought,
600460	607340	he admires the vegetation until suddenly he is eye to eye with another hunter,
607340	614700	frozen in terror just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different options.
616060	624780	The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a decision. Maybe the only way out of the dark
624860	628780	forest is to step into the clearing, together.
630620	637100	And with this hopeful picture, we say goodbye to the year 12,021 of the human era.
637100	642060	It was a wild year to say the least, still much more fun than 12,020.
642060	647740	Kurzgesagt had its most successful month ever and published a book. We tried a lot of new techniques
647740	652620	and already got into Blender and Cinema 4D, hiding more and more 3D in our videos.
653420	658700	We have so many ideas for next year and big and ambitious plans that we can't
658700	665340	wait to share with you. And all of this was and is possible because of your direct support.
665900	669740	Thank you so much. Kurzgesagt only works because of you.
670620	674940	So, in tune with the end of the year, we've designed a few products that will help you
674940	680620	to visualize your place in the universe. Our very shiny The Night Sky poster shows
680620	685580	you the little piece of space we can see from Earth with our own eyes, or travel further out
685580	690060	with our stellar Zoom collection that depicts our home in space from an increasing distance,
690940	698060	or dream with our space-themed notebooks, scenic posters, and pens. We design and produce every
698060	703020	single product with great care. Getting something from our shop is the best way to support
703020	709740	Kurzgesagt. We hope you have a wonderful end of the year and that 12,022 is more fun and
709740	723900	less exciting than the last two years. Thank you for watching.
