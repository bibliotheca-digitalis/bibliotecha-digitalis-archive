0	7100	If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole.
7900	12580	Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place.
13460	20120	Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view, with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window.
20980	26260	But are wormholes real, or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths?
27160	30840	If they are real, how do they work, and where can we find them?
41240	48180	For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple. A big, flat stage where the events of the universe unfold.
48840	53100	Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left.
53940	59260	That empty stage is space, and it exists, unchanging and eternal.
60060	62780	Einstein's theory of relativity changed that.
63340	69300	It says that space and time make up that stage together, and they aren't the same everywhere.
70220	75220	The things on the stage can affect the stage itself, stretching and warping it.
76020	81660	If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood, Einstein's stage is more like a waterbed.
82420	89760	This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible.
90820	95840	Let's see what that would look like in 2D. Our universe is like a big flat sheet.
96360	104520	Bent in just the right way, wormholes could connect two very, very distant spots with a short bridge that you could cross almost instantaneously,
105180	108620	enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light.
109340	111660	So, where can we find a wormhole?
112540	114540	Presently, only on paper.
115020	119620	General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist.
120380	128580	General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality.
129180	132740	But they are theoretically possible, and there are different kinds.
132740	140860	The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein-Rosen bridges.
141140	145760	They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe.
146240	152340	Let's try to picture them in 2D again. Empty space-time is flat, but curved by objects on it.
152340	156840	If we compress that object, space-time gets more curved around it.
157560	163560	Eventually, space-time becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole.
164760	170520	A one-way barrier forms the event horizon, which anything can enter, but nothing can escape,
171000	173960	trapped forever at the singularity at its core.
174520	177240	But maybe there is no singularity here.
177640	182960	One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe again,
183120	186720	but mirrored upside down, where time runs backwards.
187680	190320	In our universe, things fall into the black hole.
191200	197280	In the parallel universe, with backwards time, the mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bang.
198000	200000	This is called a white hole.
200300	203360	Unfortunately, Einstein-Rosen bridges can't actually be crossed.
203760	208800	It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite universe, and they crimp shut in the middle.
209440	215200	If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the white hole. You'll only become dead.
216320	222800	So, to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole, a traversable wormhole.
227760	232240	If string theory, or one of its variations, is the correct description of our universe,
232560	238160	then we could be lucky, and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already.
239040	245600	Shortly after the big bang, quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales, far, far smaller than an atom,
245920	248980	may have created many, many traversable wormholes.
249920	252960	Threaded through them are strings, called cosmic strings.
253760	261760	In the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the big bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny wormholes were pulled light-years apart,
262080	264080	scattering them through the universe.
264480	269440	If wormholes were made in the early universe, whether with cosmic strings or some other way,
269840	272880	they could be all over, just waiting to be discovered.
273680	275680	One might even be closer than we realize.
276720	280320	From the outside, black holes and wormholes can look very similar,
280560	286400	leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes.
287120	292000	It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out, though, but that's okay.
292960	298320	There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole. We could try to make one.
302640	307440	To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties we want a wormhole to have.
308080	311700	First, it must obviously connect two distant parts of space-time,
312480	314480	like your bedroom and the bathroom,
315280	317280	or Earth and Jupiter.
317280	323440	Second, it should not contain any event horizons, which would block two-way travel.
324160	329440	Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational forces don't kill human travelers.
330000	333280	The biggest problem we have to solve is keeping our wormholes open.
334080	337520	No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them.
338320	343280	Gravity wants to pinch it closed and cut the bridge, leaving only black holes at the ends.
344080	349040	Whether it's a traversable wormhole with both ends in ours, or a wormhole to another universe,
349360	352480	it will try to close unless we have something propping it open.
353360	357200	For very old string theory wormholes, that's the cosmic strings job.
357920	360640	For man-made wormholes, we need a new ingredient.
363420	366720	This isn't anything like we find on Earth, or even antimatter.
367120	373680	It's something totally new and different and exciting, with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before.
374540	377200	Exotic matter is stuff that has negative mass.
378000	383120	Positive mass, like people and planets and everything else in the universe, is attractive because of gravity.
383840	387120	But negative mass would be repulsive. It would push you away.
387920	391780	This makes a kind of anti-gravity that props open our wormholes.
392500	399940	And exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push space-time open, greater even than the pressure at the centers of neutron stars.
400980	404900	With exotic matter, we could weave space-time however we see fit.
406740	411380	We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter, the vacuum of space itself.
412980	421060	Quantum fluctuations in empty space are constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles, only for them to be annihilated an instant later.
421860	430020	The vacuum of space is boiling with them, and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect similar to the negative mass we're looking for.
431060	434100	We could use this to stabilize our wormholes.
435140	441380	Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together, so we'd have to move them around to interesting places.
442180	447300	We could start by wiring the solar system, leaving one end of each wormhole in orbit around the Earth.
448100	450100	We could fling others into deep space.
450660	459220	The Earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization, spread over light-years, but only a wormhole away.
460180	462500	However, wormholes have a dark side.
463220	473060	Even opening a single wormhole kind of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradoxes and violating the causal structure of the universe.
473060	481300	Many scientists think that this not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all.
482420	488020	So for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts and on paper in the form of equations.
488900	493220	We know you want to know more about universe stuff, so we're trying something new.
