00:00.000 --> 00:07.100
If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.580
Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place.

00:13.460 --> 00:20.120
Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view, with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window.

00:20.980 --> 00:26.260
But are wormholes real, or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths?

00:27.160 --> 00:30.840
If they are real, how do they work, and where can we find them?

00:41.240 --> 00:48.180
For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple. A big, flat stage where the events of the universe unfold.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.100
Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left.

00:53.940 --> 00:59.260
That empty stage is space, and it exists, unchanging and eternal.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.780
Einstein's theory of relativity changed that.

01:03.340 --> 01:09.300
It says that space and time make up that stage together, and they aren't the same everywhere.

01:10.220 --> 01:15.220
The things on the stage can affect the stage itself, stretching and warping it.

01:16.020 --> 01:21.660
If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood, Einstein's stage is more like a waterbed.

01:22.420 --> 01:29.760
This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible.

01:30.820 --> 01:35.840
Let's see what that would look like in 2D. Our universe is like a big flat sheet.

01:36.360 --> 01:44.520
Bent in just the right way, wormholes could connect two very, very distant spots with a short bridge that you could cross almost instantaneously,

01:45.180 --> 01:48.620
enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.660
So, where can we find a wormhole?

01:52.540 --> 01:54.540
Presently, only on paper.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.620
General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist.

02:00.380 --> 02:08.580
General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality.

02:09.180 --> 02:12.740
But they are theoretically possible, and there are different kinds.

02:12.740 --> 02:20.860
The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein-Rosen bridges.

02:21.140 --> 02:25.760
They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe.

02:26.240 --> 02:32.340
Let's try to picture them in 2D again. Empty space-time is flat, but curved by objects on it.

02:32.340 --> 02:36.840
If we compress that object, space-time gets more curved around it.

02:37.560 --> 02:43.560
Eventually, space-time becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole.

02:44.760 --> 02:50.520
A one-way barrier forms the event horizon, which anything can enter, but nothing can escape,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.960
trapped forever at the singularity at its core.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.240
But maybe there is no singularity here.

02:57.640 --> 03:02.960
One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe again,

03:03.120 --> 03:06.720
but mirrored upside down, where time runs backwards.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.320
In our universe, things fall into the black hole.

03:11.200 --> 03:17.280
In the parallel universe, with backwards time, the mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bang.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
This is called a white hole.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.360
Unfortunately, Einstein-Rosen bridges can't actually be crossed.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.800
It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite universe, and they crimp shut in the middle.

03:29.440 --> 03:35.200
If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the white hole. You'll only become dead.

03:36.320 --> 03:42.800
So, to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole, a traversable wormhole.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.240
If string theory, or one of its variations, is the correct description of our universe,

03:52.560 --> 03:58.160
then we could be lucky, and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already.

03:59.040 --> 04:05.600
Shortly after the big bang, quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales, far, far smaller than an atom,

04:05.920 --> 04:08.980
may have created many, many traversable wormholes.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.960
Threaded through them are strings, called cosmic strings.

04:13.760 --> 04:21.760
In the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the big bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny wormholes were pulled light-years apart,

04:22.080 --> 04:24.080
scattering them through the universe.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.440
If wormholes were made in the early universe, whether with cosmic strings or some other way,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.880
they could be all over, just waiting to be discovered.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.680
One might even be closer than we realize.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.320
From the outside, black holes and wormholes can look very similar,

04:40.560 --> 04:46.400
leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.000
It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out, though, but that's okay.

04:52.960 --> 04:58.320
There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole. We could try to make one.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.440
To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties we want a wormhole to have.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.700
First, it must obviously connect two distant parts of space-time,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.480
like your bedroom and the bathroom,

05:15.280 --> 05:17.280
or Earth and Jupiter.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.440
Second, it should not contain any event horizons, which would block two-way travel.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.440
Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational forces don't kill human travelers.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.280
The biggest problem we have to solve is keeping our wormholes open.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.520
No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them.

05:38.320 --> 05:43.280
Gravity wants to pinch it closed and cut the bridge, leaving only black holes at the ends.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.040
Whether it's a traversable wormhole with both ends in ours, or a wormhole to another universe,

05:49.360 --> 05:52.480
it will try to close unless we have something propping it open.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.200
For very old string theory wormholes, that's the cosmic strings job.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.640
For man-made wormholes, we need a new ingredient.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.720
This isn't anything like we find on Earth, or even antimatter.

06:07.120 --> 06:13.680
It's something totally new and different and exciting, with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.200
Exotic matter is stuff that has negative mass.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.120
Positive mass, like people and planets and everything else in the universe, is attractive because of gravity.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.120
But negative mass would be repulsive. It would push you away.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.780
This makes a kind of anti-gravity that props open our wormholes.

06:32.500 --> 06:39.940
And exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push space-time open, greater even than the pressure at the centers of neutron stars.

06:40.980 --> 06:44.900
With exotic matter, we could weave space-time however we see fit.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.380
We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter, the vacuum of space itself.

06:52.980 --> 07:01.060
Quantum fluctuations in empty space are constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles, only for them to be annihilated an instant later.

07:01.860 --> 07:10.020
The vacuum of space is boiling with them, and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect similar to the negative mass we're looking for.

07:11.060 --> 07:14.100
We could use this to stabilize our wormholes.

07:15.140 --> 07:21.380
Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together, so we'd have to move them around to interesting places.

07:22.180 --> 07:27.300
We could start by wiring the solar system, leaving one end of each wormhole in orbit around the Earth.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.100
We could fling others into deep space.

07:30.660 --> 07:39.220
The Earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization, spread over light-years, but only a wormhole away.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.500
However, wormholes have a dark side.

07:43.220 --> 07:53.060
Even opening a single wormhole kind of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradoxes and violating the causal structure of the universe.

07:53.060 --> 08:01.300
Many scientists think that this not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all.

08:02.420 --> 08:08.020
So for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts and on paper in the form of equations.

08:08.900 --> 08:13.220
We know you want to know more about universe stuff, so we're trying something new.

08:13.780 --> 08:19.540
