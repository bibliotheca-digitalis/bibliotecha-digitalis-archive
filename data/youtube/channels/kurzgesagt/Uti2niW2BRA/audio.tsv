0	4000	What is hydraulic fracturing or fracking?
4000	9000	Since the Industrial Revolution, our energy consumption has risen unceasingly.
9000	16000	The majority of this energy consumption is supplied by fossil fuels like coal or natural gas.
16000	21000	Recently, there's been a lot of talk about a controversial method of extracting natural gas.
21000	25000	Hydraulic fracturing or fracking?
25000	30000	Put simply, fracking describes the recovery of natural gas from deep layers inside the Earth.
30000	35000	In this method, porous rock is fractured by the use of water, sand, and chemicals
35000	39000	in order to release the enclosed natural gas.
39000	44000	The technique of fracking has been known since the 1940s.
44000	51000	Nonetheless, only in the last 10 years has there been quite a fracking boom, especially in the USA.
51000	58000	This is because most conventional natural gas sources in America and on the European continent have been exhausted.
58000	63000	Thus, prices for natural gas and other fuels are rising steadily.
63000	70000	Significantly more complicated and expensive methods, like fracking, have now become attractive and profitable.
70000	76000	In the meantime, fracking has already been used more than a million times in the USA alone.
77000	83000	Over 60% of all new oil and gas wells are drilled by using fracking.
83000	87000	Now, let's take a look at how fracking actually works.
87000	91000	First, a shaft is drilled several hundred meters into the Earth.
91000	97000	From there, a horizontal hole is drilled into the gas-bearing layer of rock.
97000	102000	Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into the ground using high-performance pumps.
102000	110000	On average, the fluid consists of 8 million liters of water, which amounts to about the daily consumption of 65,000 people,
110000	115000	plus several thousand tons of sand and about 200,000 liters of chemicals.
115000	121000	The mixture penetrates into the rock layer and produces innumerable tiny cracks.
121000	125000	The sand prevents the cracks from closing again.
125000	128000	The chemicals perform various tasks.
128000	134000	Among other things, they compress the water, kill off bacteria, or dissolve minerals.
134000	138000	Next, the majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again.
138000	142000	And now the natural gas can be recovered.
142000	146000	As soon as the gas source is exhausted, the drill hole is sealed.
146000	152000	As a rule, the fracking fluid is pumped back into deep underground layers and sealed in there.
152000	157000	However, fracking is also associated with several considerable risks.
157000	161000	The primary risk consists in the contamination of drinking water sources.
161000	169000	Fracking not only consumes large quantities of fresh water, but in addition the water is subsequently contaminated and is highly toxic.
169000	176000	The contamination is so severe that the water cannot even be cleaned in a treatment plant.
176000	186000	Even though the danger is known and, theoretically, could be managed, in the USA already, sources have been contaminated due to negligence.
186000	194000	No one yet knows how the enclosed water will behave in the future since there have not yet been any long-term studies on the subject.
194000	205000	The chemicals used in fracking vary from the hazardous to the extremely toxic and carcinogenic, such as benzol or formic acid.
205000	212000	The companies using fracking say nothing about the precise composition of the chemical mixture.
212000	219000	But it is known that there are about 700 different chemical agents which can be used in the process.
219000	223000	Another risk is the release of greenhouse gases.
223000	233000	The natural gas recovered by fracking consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas which is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
233000	236000	Natural gas is less harmful than coal when burned.
236000	242000	But nonetheless, the negative effects of fracking on the climate balance are overall greater.
242000	247000	Firstly, the fracking process requires a very large consumption of energy.
247000	256000	Secondly, the drill holes are quickly exhausted and it's necessary to drill fracking holes much more frequently than for classical natural gas wells.
256000	264000	In addition, about 3% of the recovered gas is lost in the extraction and escapes into the atmosphere.
264000	271000	So how is fracking and its expected benefits to be assessed when the advantages are balanced against the disadvantages?
271000	280000	When properly employed, this technique offers one way in the short to medium term to meet our demand for lower cost energy.
280000	289000	But the long-term consequences of fracking are unforeseeable and the risk to our drinking water thus should not be underestimated.
