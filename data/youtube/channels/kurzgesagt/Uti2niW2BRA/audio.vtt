00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
What is hydraulic fracturing or fracking?

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Since the Industrial Revolution, our energy consumption has risen unceasingly.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
The majority of this energy consumption is supplied by fossil fuels like coal or natural gas.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
Recently, there's been a lot of talk about a controversial method of extracting natural gas.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Hydraulic fracturing or fracking?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Put simply, fracking describes the recovery of natural gas from deep layers inside the Earth.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
In this method, porous rock is fractured by the use of water, sand, and chemicals

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
in order to release the enclosed natural gas.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
The technique of fracking has been known since the 1940s.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Nonetheless, only in the last 10 years has there been quite a fracking boom, especially in the USA.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
This is because most conventional natural gas sources in America and on the European continent have been exhausted.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Thus, prices for natural gas and other fuels are rising steadily.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Significantly more complicated and expensive methods, like fracking, have now become attractive and profitable.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
In the meantime, fracking has already been used more than a million times in the USA alone.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Over 60% of all new oil and gas wells are drilled by using fracking.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Now, let's take a look at how fracking actually works.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
First, a shaft is drilled several hundred meters into the Earth.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
From there, a horizontal hole is drilled into the gas-bearing layer of rock.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into the ground using high-performance pumps.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
On average, the fluid consists of 8 million liters of water, which amounts to about the daily consumption of 65,000 people,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
plus several thousand tons of sand and about 200,000 liters of chemicals.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
The mixture penetrates into the rock layer and produces innumerable tiny cracks.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
The sand prevents the cracks from closing again.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
The chemicals perform various tasks.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Among other things, they compress the water, kill off bacteria, or dissolve minerals.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Next, the majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
And now the natural gas can be recovered.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
As soon as the gas source is exhausted, the drill hole is sealed.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
As a rule, the fracking fluid is pumped back into deep underground layers and sealed in there.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
However, fracking is also associated with several considerable risks.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
The primary risk consists in the contamination of drinking water sources.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
Fracking not only consumes large quantities of fresh water, but in addition the water is subsequently contaminated and is highly toxic.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
The contamination is so severe that the water cannot even be cleaned in a treatment plant.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
Even though the danger is known and, theoretically, could be managed, in the USA already, sources have been contaminated due to negligence.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
No one yet knows how the enclosed water will behave in the future since there have not yet been any long-term studies on the subject.

03:14.000 --> 03:25.000
The chemicals used in fracking vary from the hazardous to the extremely toxic and carcinogenic, such as benzol or formic acid.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
The companies using fracking say nothing about the precise composition of the chemical mixture.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
But it is known that there are about 700 different chemical agents which can be used in the process.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Another risk is the release of greenhouse gases.

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
The natural gas recovered by fracking consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas which is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Natural gas is less harmful than coal when burned.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
But nonetheless, the negative effects of fracking on the climate balance are overall greater.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Firstly, the fracking process requires a very large consumption of energy.

04:07.000 --> 04:16.000
Secondly, the drill holes are quickly exhausted and it's necessary to drill fracking holes much more frequently than for classical natural gas wells.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
In addition, about 3% of the recovered gas is lost in the extraction and escapes into the atmosphere.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
So how is fracking and its expected benefits to be assessed when the advantages are balanced against the disadvantages?

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
When properly employed, this technique offers one way in the short to medium term to meet our demand for lower cost energy.

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
But the long-term consequences of fracking are unforeseeable and the risk to our drinking water thus should not be underestimated.
