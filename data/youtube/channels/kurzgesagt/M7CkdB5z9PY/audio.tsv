0	7240	Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone.
7240	12400	They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.
12400	16980	Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces and they are exposed
16980	19600	to the freezing cold of outer space.
19600	24900	They know no seasons, no days, and no nights which could give away the passing of time.
24900	30180	And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life to all corners of the galaxy.
30180	44640	How would that work, and how does a planet become a rogue anyway?
44640	48420	There are several very different things that get called rogue planets.
48420	53620	For example, sub-brown dwarfs, gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and the
53620	56140	boring little brothers of brown dwarfs.
56140	60900	They're a sort of failed star, and we'll now stop talking about them.
60900	65980	A far more interesting sort of rogue are terrestrial planets similar to Earth that got kicked out
65980	67900	of their planetary system.
67900	73020	Young star systems are dangerous places where protoplanets are battling for the available
73020	76480	mass guzzling up as much material as possible.
76480	80540	In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other or get dangerously close to
80540	82140	each other's orbits.
82140	86900	If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star, it can kick smaller planets
86900	88500	out of the system.
88500	93260	But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation doesn't mean it's
93260	94260	safe.
94260	99560	Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars or black holes at any point.
99560	103940	Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues.
103940	107260	Scientists don't agree on the numbers, but it's likely that at the very least, there
107260	111020	are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone.
111020	113740	Most rogues will share the same depressing fate.
113740	118540	As their star becomes smaller day by day, the planet's surface quickly cools down to
118540	122160	minus 270 degrees Celsius.
122160	125900	If they have oceans, they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock.
125900	130820	Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface and eventually freeze too.
130820	137880	But weirdly enough, some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life.
137880	142240	To understand how, let's imagine a planet similar to Earth in the same order of magnitude
142240	145440	in terms of mass and composition.
145440	149980	If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life?
149980	155120	As far as we understand the nature of life, there is one indispensable ingredient it needs
155120	157680	â€” liquid water.
157680	163140	Water is important because it mixes things, both matter and energy, which lets interesting
163140	166400	chemistry happen, like life.
166400	170240	So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough
170240	172280	to sustain liquid water.
172280	178160	Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the sun.
178160	184120	So our imaginary rogue Earth needs to work with the 0.03% of energy it has left, which
184120	187320	almost exclusively comes from its hot center.
187320	192440	Earth's inner core is a giant metal ball, about as hot as the surface of the sun, that's
192440	197640	surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very, very slowly solidifying,
197640	200120	releasing a lot of heat in the process.
200120	205000	As long as this process is ongoing, our planet will be geologically active, with solid and
205000	209680	liquid material moving around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed
209680	211800	as geothermal energy.
211800	216480	While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually, this process takes billions
216480	221840	of years, enough time for life to come into existence and thrive.
221840	225480	There's even one scenario that could allow an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are
225480	227120	not frozen over.
227120	232680	If the planet had an extremely dense and high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere, the gas would not freeze
232680	237040	and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet to enable oceans that extend
237040	239360	all the way to the surface.
239360	242880	And there's another possible way to stay warm, moons.
242880	246800	If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them, a large enough moon could inject
246800	250620	additional energy into the system via tidal forces.
250620	255460	These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day, like kneading dough,
255460	256900	keeping it warm.
256900	261980	But the most likely scenario for a rogue-bearing life is one with subglacial oceans under a
261980	265100	kilometer-thick layer of mostly water ice.
265100	269980	These are not completely absurd, since we already have a few of them in the solar system.
269980	275940	So how could life sustain itself at the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean?
275940	280500	On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness, in volcanically active areas, there
280500	283800	are hydrothermal vents called black smokers.
283800	288820	They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water, providing a constant flow of minerals
288820	291340	from Earth's mantle.
291340	295980	Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials which attracts crustaceans,
295980	302120	bivalves, snails, fish, octopus, and tube worms up to two meters long.
302120	306440	Not only are hydrothermal vents home to an incredibly diverse group of living beings,
306440	310400	but also a contender for the place where life could have begun on Earth billions of
310400	311860	years ago.
311860	316880	In the dark ocean of a rogue planet, similar vents or volcanic activity could be the starting
316880	322260	point and basis for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now.
322260	327240	One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has is that the environment is extremely
327240	328400	stable.
328400	332560	The thick ice sheet protects it from all sorts of extinction events, and as long as the energy
332560	337000	from the core keeps on coming, things stay pretty much the same.
337000	342400	The most likely forms of life are bacteria and other microorganisms, but given enough
342400	347300	time, more complex alien animals could feed on the smaller beings and thrive.
347300	351680	It's not impossible that intelligent life could emerge in such an environment.
351680	355920	If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world.
355920	361120	Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top and bedrock at the bottom,
361120	366500	without any plants to store star energy, there would be no wood, oil, or coal.
366500	371120	Even if there were, it's not like you'd discover fire at the bottom of an ocean.
371120	375680	Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things.
375680	379440	Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice.
379440	383800	They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside, and assume that their
383800	386720	small world is all there is.
386720	391900	Hundreds of generations might live and die in these dark oceans, ignorant of the unbelievably
391900	399200	big universe above the ice, until the core of their planet cools off and all life vanishes.
399200	404240	As the oceans completely freeze, the remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped
404240	406520	in an icy grave forever.
406520	410780	If you think about it, it might be better not to be aware of all that.
410780	414700	But the concept is disturbing and exciting.
414700	419260	The universe might be teeming with life, trapped on planets that are basically impossible
419260	420660	to leave.
420660	425400	Worlds like this could frequently pass the solar system without us even knowing.
425400	431000	Maybe one day, in the far future, humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds and
431000	433780	try to say hello.
433780	440120	Okay, so we love gloomy future scenarios, but let's go back to the present for a different
440120	441520	kind of surprise.
