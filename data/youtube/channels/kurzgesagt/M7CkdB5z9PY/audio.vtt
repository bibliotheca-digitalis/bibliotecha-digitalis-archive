00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone.

00:07.240 --> 00:12.400
They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.980
Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces and they are exposed

00:16.980 --> 00:19.600
to the freezing cold of outer space.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.900
They know no seasons, no days, and no nights which could give away the passing of time.

00:24.900 --> 00:30.180
And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life to all corners of the galaxy.

00:30.180 --> 00:44.640
How would that work, and how does a planet become a rogue anyway?

00:44.640 --> 00:48.420
There are several very different things that get called rogue planets.

00:48.420 --> 00:53.620
For example, sub-brown dwarfs, gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and the

00:53.620 --> 00:56.140
boring little brothers of brown dwarfs.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.900
They're a sort of failed star, and we'll now stop talking about them.

01:00.900 --> 01:05.980
A far more interesting sort of rogue are terrestrial planets similar to Earth that got kicked out

01:05.980 --> 01:07.900
of their planetary system.

01:07.900 --> 01:13.020
Young star systems are dangerous places where protoplanets are battling for the available

01:13.020 --> 01:16.480
mass guzzling up as much material as possible.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.540
In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other or get dangerously close to

01:20.540 --> 01:22.140
each other's orbits.

01:22.140 --> 01:26.900
If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star, it can kick smaller planets

01:26.900 --> 01:28.500
out of the system.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.260
But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation doesn't mean it's

01:33.260 --> 01:34.260
safe.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.560
Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars or black holes at any point.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.940
Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues.

01:43.940 --> 01:47.260
Scientists don't agree on the numbers, but it's likely that at the very least, there

01:47.260 --> 01:51.020
are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone.

01:51.020 --> 01:53.740
Most rogues will share the same depressing fate.

01:53.740 --> 01:58.540
As their star becomes smaller day by day, the planet's surface quickly cools down to

01:58.540 --> 02:02.160
minus 270 degrees Celsius.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.900
If they have oceans, they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock.

02:05.900 --> 02:10.820
Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface and eventually freeze too.

02:10.820 --> 02:17.880
But weirdly enough, some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.240
To understand how, let's imagine a planet similar to Earth in the same order of magnitude

02:22.240 --> 02:25.440
in terms of mass and composition.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.980
If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life?

02:29.980 --> 02:35.120
As far as we understand the nature of life, there is one indispensable ingredient it needs

02:35.120 --> 02:37.680
â€” liquid water.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.140
Water is important because it mixes things, both matter and energy, which lets interesting

02:43.140 --> 02:46.400
chemistry happen, like life.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.240
So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough

02:50.240 --> 02:52.280
to sustain liquid water.

02:52.280 --> 02:58.160
Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the sun.

02:58.160 --> 03:04.120
So our imaginary rogue Earth needs to work with the 0.03% of energy it has left, which

03:04.120 --> 03:07.320
almost exclusively comes from its hot center.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.440
Earth's inner core is a giant metal ball, about as hot as the surface of the sun, that's

03:12.440 --> 03:17.640
surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very, very slowly solidifying,

03:17.640 --> 03:20.120
releasing a lot of heat in the process.

03:20.120 --> 03:25.000
As long as this process is ongoing, our planet will be geologically active, with solid and

03:25.000 --> 03:29.680
liquid material moving around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed

03:29.680 --> 03:31.800
as geothermal energy.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.480
While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually, this process takes billions

03:36.480 --> 03:41.840
of years, enough time for life to come into existence and thrive.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.480
There's even one scenario that could allow an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are

03:45.480 --> 03:47.120
not frozen over.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.680
If the planet had an extremely dense and high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere, the gas would not freeze

03:52.680 --> 03:57.040
and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet to enable oceans that extend

03:57.040 --> 03:59.360
all the way to the surface.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.880
And there's another possible way to stay warm, moons.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.800
If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them, a large enough moon could inject

04:06.800 --> 04:10.620
additional energy into the system via tidal forces.

04:10.620 --> 04:15.460
These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day, like kneading dough,

04:15.460 --> 04:16.900
keeping it warm.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.980
But the most likely scenario for a rogue-bearing life is one with subglacial oceans under a

04:21.980 --> 04:25.100
kilometer-thick layer of mostly water ice.

04:25.100 --> 04:29.980
These are not completely absurd, since we already have a few of them in the solar system.

04:29.980 --> 04:35.940
So how could life sustain itself at the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean?

04:35.940 --> 04:40.500
On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness, in volcanically active areas, there

04:40.500 --> 04:43.800
are hydrothermal vents called black smokers.

04:43.800 --> 04:48.820
They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water, providing a constant flow of minerals

04:48.820 --> 04:51.340
from Earth's mantle.

04:51.340 --> 04:55.980
Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials which attracts crustaceans,

04:55.980 --> 05:02.120
bivalves, snails, fish, octopus, and tube worms up to two meters long.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.440
Not only are hydrothermal vents home to an incredibly diverse group of living beings,

05:06.440 --> 05:10.400
but also a contender for the place where life could have begun on Earth billions of

05:10.400 --> 05:11.860
years ago.

05:11.860 --> 05:16.880
In the dark ocean of a rogue planet, similar vents or volcanic activity could be the starting

05:16.880 --> 05:22.260
point and basis for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now.

05:22.260 --> 05:27.240
One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has is that the environment is extremely

05:27.240 --> 05:28.400
stable.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.560
The thick ice sheet protects it from all sorts of extinction events, and as long as the energy

05:32.560 --> 05:37.000
from the core keeps on coming, things stay pretty much the same.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.400
The most likely forms of life are bacteria and other microorganisms, but given enough

05:42.400 --> 05:47.300
time, more complex alien animals could feed on the smaller beings and thrive.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.680
It's not impossible that intelligent life could emerge in such an environment.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.920
If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.120
Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top and bedrock at the bottom,

06:01.120 --> 06:06.500
without any plants to store star energy, there would be no wood, oil, or coal.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.120
Even if there were, it's not like you'd discover fire at the bottom of an ocean.

06:11.120 --> 06:15.680
Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.440
Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.800
They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside, and assume that their

06:23.800 --> 06:26.720
small world is all there is.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.900
Hundreds of generations might live and die in these dark oceans, ignorant of the unbelievably

06:31.900 --> 06:39.200
big universe above the ice, until the core of their planet cools off and all life vanishes.

06:39.200 --> 06:44.240
As the oceans completely freeze, the remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped

06:44.240 --> 06:46.520
in an icy grave forever.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.780
If you think about it, it might be better not to be aware of all that.

06:50.780 --> 06:54.700
But the concept is disturbing and exciting.

06:54.700 --> 06:59.260
The universe might be teeming with life, trapped on planets that are basically impossible

06:59.260 --> 07:00.660
to leave.

07:00.660 --> 07:05.400
Worlds like this could frequently pass the solar system without us even knowing.

07:05.400 --> 07:11.000
Maybe one day, in the far future, humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds and

07:11.000 --> 07:13.780
try to say hello.

07:13.780 --> 07:20.120
Okay, so we love gloomy future scenarios, but let's go back to the present for a different

07:20.120 --> 07:21.520
kind of surprise.

07:21.520 --> 07:26.300
Many of you want to know how we make our videos, so we made a video about that.

07:26.300 --> 07:30.980
