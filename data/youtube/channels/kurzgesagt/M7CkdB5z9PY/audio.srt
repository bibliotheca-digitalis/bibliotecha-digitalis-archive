1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,400
They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,980
Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces and they are exposed

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,600
to the freezing cold of outer space.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,900
They know no seasons, no days, and no nights which could give away the passing of time.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,180
And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life to all corners of the galaxy.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:44,640
How would that work, and how does a planet become a rogue anyway?

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,420
There are several very different things that get called rogue planets.

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,620
For example, sub-brown dwarfs, gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and the

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,140
boring little brothers of brown dwarfs.

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,900
They're a sort of failed star, and we'll now stop talking about them.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,980
A far more interesting sort of rogue are terrestrial planets similar to Earth that got kicked out

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,900
of their planetary system.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,020
Young star systems are dangerous places where protoplanets are battling for the available

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,480
mass guzzling up as much material as possible.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,540
In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other or get dangerously close to

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,140
each other's orbits.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,900
If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star, it can kick smaller planets

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,500
out of the system.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,260
But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation doesn't mean it's

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,260
safe.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,560
Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars or black holes at any point.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,940
Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues.

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,260
Scientists don't agree on the numbers, but it's likely that at the very least, there

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,020
are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone.

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,740
Most rogues will share the same depressing fate.

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,540
As their star becomes smaller day by day, the planet's surface quickly cools down to

28
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,160
minus 270 degrees Celsius.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,900
If they have oceans, they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock.

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,820
Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface and eventually freeze too.

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:17,880
But weirdly enough, some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,240
To understand how, let's imagine a planet similar to Earth in the same order of magnitude

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,440
in terms of mass and composition.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,980
If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life?

35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,120
As far as we understand the nature of life, there is one indispensable ingredient it needs

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
â€” liquid water.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,140
Water is important because it mixes things, both matter and energy, which lets interesting

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,400
chemistry happen, like life.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,280
to sustain liquid water.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,160
Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the sun.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,120
So our imaginary rogue Earth needs to work with the 0.03% of energy it has left, which

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,320
almost exclusively comes from its hot center.

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,440
Earth's inner core is a giant metal ball, about as hot as the surface of the sun, that's

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,640
surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very, very slowly solidifying,

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,120
releasing a lot of heat in the process.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,000
As long as this process is ongoing, our planet will be geologically active, with solid and

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,680
liquid material moving around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,800
as geothermal energy.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,480
While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually, this process takes billions

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,840
of years, enough time for life to come into existence and thrive.

52
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,480
There's even one scenario that could allow an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,120
not frozen over.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,680
If the planet had an extremely dense and high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere, the gas would not freeze

55
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,040
and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet to enable oceans that extend

56
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
all the way to the surface.

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,880
And there's another possible way to stay warm, moons.

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,800
If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them, a large enough moon could inject

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,620
additional energy into the system via tidal forces.

60
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,460
These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day, like kneading dough,

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,900
keeping it warm.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,980
But the most likely scenario for a rogue-bearing life is one with subglacial oceans under a

63
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,100
kilometer-thick layer of mostly water ice.

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,980
These are not completely absurd, since we already have a few of them in the solar system.

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,940
So how could life sustain itself at the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean?

66
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,500
On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness, in volcanically active areas, there

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,800
are hydrothermal vents called black smokers.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,820
They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water, providing a constant flow of minerals

69
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,340
from Earth's mantle.

70
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,980
Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials which attracts crustaceans,

71
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,120
bivalves, snails, fish, octopus, and tube worms up to two meters long.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,440
Not only are hydrothermal vents home to an incredibly diverse group of living beings,

73
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,400
but also a contender for the place where life could have begun on Earth billions of

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,860
years ago.

75
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,880
In the dark ocean of a rogue planet, similar vents or volcanic activity could be the starting

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,260
point and basis for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now.

77
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,240
One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has is that the environment is extremely

78
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,400
stable.

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
The thick ice sheet protects it from all sorts of extinction events, and as long as the energy

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,000
from the core keeps on coming, things stay pretty much the same.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,400
The most likely forms of life are bacteria and other microorganisms, but given enough

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,300
time, more complex alien animals could feed on the smaller beings and thrive.

83
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,680
It's not impossible that intelligent life could emerge in such an environment.

84
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,920
If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world.

85
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top and bedrock at the bottom,

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,500
without any plants to store star energy, there would be no wood, oil, or coal.

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,120
Even if there were, it's not like you'd discover fire at the bottom of an ocean.

88
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things.

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,440
Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice.

90
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,800
They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside, and assume that their

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,720
small world is all there is.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,900
Hundreds of generations might live and die in these dark oceans, ignorant of the unbelievably

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:39,200
big universe above the ice, until the core of their planet cools off and all life vanishes.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,240
As the oceans completely freeze, the remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped

95
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,520
in an icy grave forever.

96
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,780
If you think about it, it might be better not to be aware of all that.

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,700
But the concept is disturbing and exciting.

98
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,260
The universe might be teeming with life, trapped on planets that are basically impossible

99
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,660
to leave.

100
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,400
Worlds like this could frequently pass the solar system without us even knowing.

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,000
Maybe one day, in the far future, humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds and

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,780
try to say hello.

103
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,120
Okay, so we love gloomy future scenarios, but let's go back to the present for a different

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
kind of surprise.

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,300
Many of you want to know how we make our videos, so we made a video about that.

106
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,980
