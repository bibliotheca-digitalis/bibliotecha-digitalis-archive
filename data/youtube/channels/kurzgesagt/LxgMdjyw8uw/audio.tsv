880	7360	Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions
7360	11680	will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming, and we may soon hit tipping points
11680	18480	that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization. While scientists, activists,
18480	23360	and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to
23360	28560	doing anything meaningful, while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change.
29280	34240	It seems humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal
34240	39840	gain to save itself. And so for many, the future looks grim and hopeless.
40960	45360	Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a
45360	50400	lifetime of opportunity, they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids
50400	56720	into this world. It's an age of doom and hopelessness, and giving up seems the only
56720	64320	sensible thing to do. But that's not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.
73440	78800	Despite the seriousness of the situation, for years, positive trends have accumulated,
78800	84320	and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our collective climate goals.
84320	88160	Welcome to our TED talk. Please watch this video to the end. Check out our
88160	94080	detailed sources afterwards to learn more. Okay, let's start with the scariest things.
95440	101440	Canceling the apocalypse. Some of the most widely shared stories about climate change
101440	106960	are that it is an existential threat, the end of human civilization, and maybe even our own
106960	112080	extinction event, and that it is basically unavoidable now. But what does science actually
112080	119040	say? As of 2022, the global average temperature has risen 1.2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial
119040	124880	times. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,
124880	131120	but we are not likely to meet it. Already with the warming we have today, hot places will get hotter,
131120	136480	wet places wetter, and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly.
137440	143040	Warming beyond 2 degrees makes all of these extremes more extreme. Extreme weather events
143040	148560	more common, with more ecosystems under major pressure. Some will not survive.
149520	153920	At 3 degrees, significant parts of Earth, especially in developing countries,
153920	158880	might become unable to feed their populations. Heat waves will become a major global issue.
159440	164800	Large-scale natural systems will break down. The scale and frequency of hurricanes, fires,
164800	170880	and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage. Poor regions and subsistence
170880	175920	farmers will be hit the hardest. Hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes.
176640	182560	In the 4-8 degree range, the apocalypse begins. The hot house Earth, where things change so
182560	188640	quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions may perish,
188640	194960	leaving the rest on a hostile alien planet. A decade ago, for lack of action and perspective,
194960	200560	many scientists assumed a 4-plus degree world was our future, and a lot of public communication
200560	206240	focused on exactly this future path. Luckily, it's much less likely that this version of the
206240	212480	apocalypse will come to pass. If current climate policies stagnate, we're likely to end up with
212480	220240	warming of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. Which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable.
220800	226720	But this is actually good news. How? In the last decade, we've seen enough progress that
226720	232160	most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change. Although
232160	237120	substantial risk still remains, we can pretty confidently say that humanity isn't going
237120	243680	anywhere. Civilization might have to change, but it will endure. Which begs the question,
244240	250640	what has changed over the last 10 years? And is this really good news? The invisible shift.
251760	256480	You probably know this story. The last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies
256480	261440	around the world. Instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce
261440	267360	emissions, we mostly did nothing. A lost decade with one negative record after another.
267920	273440	And this story is true, and it's one reason why so many people are giving up. But it is not the
273440	279040	whole picture. Despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation
279040	284960	campaigns from the fossil fuel industries, there was a lot of progress. Let's go back 20 years
284960	293040	to see why today is so different. Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24%,
293840	299120	three times as much as the increase in the previous decade. Subsidies for fossil fuels
299120	303680	aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption.
304320	308800	For developing countries like China and India, coal was the cheapest fuel for growth,
308800	311760	while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways.
312400	317920	In 2010, many people expected these trends to continue. Instead of decreasing fossil fuel use,
317920	322640	its consumption would rise. The next decade turned out to be very different, though.
323840	327680	First of all, coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down,
327680	333200	or levelled off, like in China. And it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and US.
334080	339360	Since 2015, three quarters of planned coal plants have been cancelled, and 44 countries have
339360	344240	committed to stop building them. Ten years ago, that would have seemed like wishful thinking.
344240	350240	But today we can say with confidence, coal is dying. It's just not competitive anymore.
350240	354800	Because technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead.
355920	361680	Renewable electricity has shown explosive progress. In a mere decade, wind energy got
361680	368080	three times cheaper. Solar electricity is now ten times cheaper. Cheaper than coal or any other
368080	373200	fossil fuel burning power plant, despite the massive subsidies and global infrastructure
373200	379920	propping up fossil fuels. 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity
379920	384160	is produced today compared with ten years ago, which is of course not nearly enough.
384880	388480	One of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output.
389120	394320	Renewables need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source, like expensive batteries.
394960	402560	Amazingly, battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years, 60% in the last decade alone,
402560	405920	which will serve all kinds of green technology like electric cars.
406880	411040	You might say, well that's great, but didn't Kurzgesagt's last climate video
411040	415760	say that while wind and solar are nice, we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of
415760	421520	our global industrial system? Yes, but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector.
422160	426640	Throughout the economy, people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions.
427680	433360	We're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are ten times more efficient.
434000	440400	In 2020, about seven out of ten new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid. In 2021,
440400	446560	it was already eight out of ten. And the list goes on, from electric heating and better insulation
446560	452320	to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel. Wherever you look, you find scientists, engineers
452320	457920	and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change. Enormous amounts of human
457920	462000	ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem, with more and more people deciding
462000	468720	to prioritize preventing rapid climate change. Solutions for low carbon production of cement,
468720	473680	electronics and steel, and innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the
473680	479120	works. The more of these technologies we deploy, the cheaper new and better technology gets.
479840	485360	The cheaper they get, the more people use them, and so on. We can see the impact already. The
485360	491360	domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession. Since the year 2000,
491360	501200	the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease, Italy 28%, the UK 35%, Denmark 43%. But the best news may be
501200	506800	that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth. In the past, this was
506800	512320	an inconvenient truth. To get richer, you had to emit more, which led to fierce arguments between
512320	516400	developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their
516400	521360	populations were still poor. But in the last decade, we've seen that it is possible to increase
521360	527440	prosperity without increasing emissions. Emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP
527440	537360	grew by 27%. France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14%, while increasing GDP by 15%. Romania saw
537360	544640	an 8% decrease and 35% growth. And even the largest economy on earth, the USA, decreased
544640	552320	emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26%. Some of you may call this a numbers trick, that
552320	556720	rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer nations by moving the dirty parts of their
556720	562080	economies like manufacturing. But even when we account for all of our imported goods, the numbers
562080	567280	still look positive. It's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the
567280	573120	climate as it seemed to be a decade ago. Developing countries will profit from that because as rich
573120	577760	countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies, they can adopt them more
577760	582320	cheaply. They can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through.
582960	589440	We are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision. And we haven't even
589440	596320	really talked about solutions like carbon capture. In 2000, it didn't really exist. In 2022, that
596320	601920	technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere.
602640	607920	As investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale, it's likely that these costs
607920	613920	will plummet over the next few decades. So everything's fine then. Well, let's not get carried
613920	619680	away. All of these processes are great, but not nearly fast enough. We're still doing way too little
619680	625680	and technology will not magically solve everything. We need to use fewer resources and use them longer,
625680	630880	design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements.
631440	637200	We need much better infrastructure, agriculture and cities. It will still be hard work, especially
637200	642720	to get the right policies passed and enacted. But for the first time ever, there are a few trend
642720	648800	lines pointing solidly in the right direction. And now imagine if all of this was achieved without
648800	654160	proper financial and political support. And despite fossil fuel lobbying, just think what
654160	659280	humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs.
659840	665920	So is it okay to feel hopeful again? The situation is still dire and serious. So what's the point of
665920	674080	focusing on this side of the story? The trap of hopelessness. Climate change can feel overwhelming
674080	680000	and make your future seem bleak. The sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real
680000	685440	and very destructive, because it causes apathy. Apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel
685440	692080	industry that is still delaying change however it can. In a sense, they have weaponized hopelessness.
692880	697120	We are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action.
697840	704560	Phase one was, climate change is not real. Phase two was, climate change is real, but not caused
704560	709840	by humans. Phase three was, climate change may be caused by humans, but it's not that bad.
710560	716160	Phase four is, climate change is no longer avoidable. We are doomed and it doesn't matter
716160	722160	what we do. If we want the world to change, we first need to believe that change is possible.
722160	727360	And we have an abundance of evidence that it is. Changes to our industrial system are gaining
727360	732320	momentum. Technology gets better and cheaper. Climate change has become a key issue in most
732320	737520	free elections. As more and more younger people move into influential positions, they prioritize
737520	743680	climate change and work on new solutions. In 2022, most governments not only acknowledge it,
743680	750560	but set their own net zero goals in democratic and autocratic countries. The results of years
750560	756400	of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible. The pressure needs to keep increasing
756400	762560	to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept. Climate doomerism is the
762560	767760	equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case, but also mitigate
767760	772480	most of the bad things, make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from
772480	780080	suffering. That is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous. If the last in many ways wasted
780080	786400	decade has shown anything, then it's the progress is being made. And that dire scenarios are just
786400	793600	predictions, not our sealed fate. As of 2022, based on current global policies, we will end up
793600	799840	in a three degrees world. Now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong, despite how
799840	805520	serious and urgent things are. To turn that three degrees into a two degrees, and then see where we
805520	812880	can go from there. For that, we need hope. And we hope we gave you that today, at least a little.
812880	818000	That you feel that things are serious, but also that you have a future. That you could have kids
818000	824240	without dooming them or the world. That taking action today is worth it. And that despite
824240	830320	powerful industries doing everything to delay it, society is changing. If you need a more concrete
830320	834800	roadmap of what you can do personally, we're working on a follow up video to talk about that
834800	842160	in greater detail. Doomerism, inactivity and weaponized hopelessness are the only trump cards
842160	852240	left for the powers that don't want change. Don't let them win. We're still excited about the future.
852880	857840	And we think one of the best things you can do to keep your optimism and curiosity up is to learn
857840	863840	new things. If you don't know where to start, our friends from brilliant.org have got you covered.
