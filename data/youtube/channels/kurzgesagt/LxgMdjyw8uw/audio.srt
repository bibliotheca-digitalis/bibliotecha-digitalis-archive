1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,360
Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,680
will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming, and we may soon hit tipping points

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,480
that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization. While scientists, activists,

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,360
and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,560
doing anything meaningful, while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,240
It seems humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,840
gain to save itself. And so for many, the future looks grim and hopeless.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,400
lifetime of opportunity, they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,720
into this world. It's an age of doom and hopelessness, and giving up seems the only

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:04,320
sensible thing to do. But that's not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,800
Despite the seriousness of the situation, for years, positive trends have accumulated,

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,320
and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our collective climate goals.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,160
Welcome to our TED talk. Please watch this video to the end. Check out our

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,080
detailed sources afterwards to learn more. Okay, let's start with the scariest things.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Canceling the apocalypse. Some of the most widely shared stories about climate change

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,960
are that it is an existential threat, the end of human civilization, and maybe even our own

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,080
extinction event, and that it is basically unavoidable now. But what does science actually

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,040
say? As of 2022, the global average temperature has risen 1.2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,880
times. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
but we are not likely to meet it. Already with the warming we have today, hot places will get hotter,

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,480
wet places wetter, and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,040
Warming beyond 2 degrees makes all of these extremes more extreme. Extreme weather events

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,560
more common, with more ecosystems under major pressure. Some will not survive.

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
At 3 degrees, significant parts of Earth, especially in developing countries,

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,880
might become unable to feed their populations. Heat waves will become a major global issue.

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,800
Large-scale natural systems will break down. The scale and frequency of hurricanes, fires,

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,880
and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage. Poor regions and subsistence

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,920
farmers will be hit the hardest. Hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes.

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,560
In the 4-8 degree range, the apocalypse begins. The hot house Earth, where things change so

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,640
quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions may perish,

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,960
leaving the rest on a hostile alien planet. A decade ago, for lack of action and perspective,

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,560
many scientists assumed a 4-plus degree world was our future, and a lot of public communication

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,240
focused on exactly this future path. Luckily, it's much less likely that this version of the

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,480
apocalypse will come to pass. If current climate policies stagnate, we're likely to end up with

36
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,240
warming of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. Which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable.

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,720
But this is actually good news. How? In the last decade, we've seen enough progress that

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,160
most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change. Although

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,120
substantial risk still remains, we can pretty confidently say that humanity isn't going

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,680
anywhere. Civilization might have to change, but it will endure. Which begs the question,

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,640
what has changed over the last 10 years? And is this really good news? The invisible shift.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,480
You probably know this story. The last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,440
around the world. Instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,360
emissions, we mostly did nothing. A lost decade with one negative record after another.

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,440
And this story is true, and it's one reason why so many people are giving up. But it is not the

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,040
whole picture. Despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,960
campaigns from the fossil fuel industries, there was a lot of progress. Let's go back 20 years

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,040
to see why today is so different. Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24%,

49
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,120
three times as much as the increase in the previous decade. Subsidies for fossil fuels

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,680
aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption.

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,800
For developing countries like China and India, coal was the cheapest fuel for growth,

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,760
while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways.

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,920
In 2010, many people expected these trends to continue. Instead of decreasing fossil fuel use,

54
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,640
its consumption would rise. The next decade turned out to be very different, though.

55
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
First of all, coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down,

56
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,200
or levelled off, like in China. And it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and US.

57
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
Since 2015, three quarters of planned coal plants have been cancelled, and 44 countries have

58
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,240
committed to stop building them. Ten years ago, that would have seemed like wishful thinking.

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,240
But today we can say with confidence, coal is dying. It's just not competitive anymore.

60
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
Because technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead.

61
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,680
Renewable electricity has shown explosive progress. In a mere decade, wind energy got

62
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,080
three times cheaper. Solar electricity is now ten times cheaper. Cheaper than coal or any other

63
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,200
fossil fuel burning power plant, despite the massive subsidies and global infrastructure

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,920
propping up fossil fuels. 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity

65
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,160
is produced today compared with ten years ago, which is of course not nearly enough.

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,480
One of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output.

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Renewables need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source, like expensive batteries.

68
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,560
Amazingly, battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years, 60% in the last decade alone,

69
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,920
which will serve all kinds of green technology like electric cars.

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,040
You might say, well that's great, but didn't Kurzgesagt's last climate video

71
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,760
say that while wind and solar are nice, we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of

72
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,520
our global industrial system? Yes, but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector.

73
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,640
Throughout the economy, people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions.

74
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,360
We're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are ten times more efficient.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,400
In 2020, about seven out of ten new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid. In 2021,

76
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,560
it was already eight out of ten. And the list goes on, from electric heating and better insulation

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,320
to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel. Wherever you look, you find scientists, engineers

78
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,920
and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change. Enormous amounts of human

79
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,000
ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem, with more and more people deciding

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,720
to prioritize preventing rapid climate change. Solutions for low carbon production of cement,

81
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
electronics and steel, and innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the

82
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,120
works. The more of these technologies we deploy, the cheaper new and better technology gets.

83
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,360
The cheaper they get, the more people use them, and so on. We can see the impact already. The

84
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,360
domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession. Since the year 2000,

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:21,200
the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease, Italy 28%, the UK 35%, Denmark 43%. But the best news may be

86
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,800
that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth. In the past, this was

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,320
an inconvenient truth. To get richer, you had to emit more, which led to fierce arguments between

88
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,400
developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their

89
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,360
populations were still poor. But in the last decade, we've seen that it is possible to increase

90
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,440
prosperity without increasing emissions. Emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP

91
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:57,360
grew by 27%. France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14%, while increasing GDP by 15%. Romania saw

92
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,640
an 8% decrease and 35% growth. And even the largest economy on earth, the USA, decreased

93
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,320
emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26%. Some of you may call this a numbers trick, that

94
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer nations by moving the dirty parts of their

95
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,080
economies like manufacturing. But even when we account for all of our imported goods, the numbers

96
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,280
still look positive. It's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the

97
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,120
climate as it seemed to be a decade ago. Developing countries will profit from that because as rich

98
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,760
countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies, they can adopt them more

99
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,320
cheaply. They can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through.

100
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,440
We are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision. And we haven't even

101
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,320
really talked about solutions like carbon capture. In 2000, it didn't really exist. In 2022, that

102
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,920
technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere.

103
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,920
As investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale, it's likely that these costs

104
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,920
will plummet over the next few decades. So everything's fine then. Well, let's not get carried

105
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,680
away. All of these processes are great, but not nearly fast enough. We're still doing way too little

106
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
and technology will not magically solve everything. We need to use fewer resources and use them longer,

107
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,880
design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements.

108
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,200
We need much better infrastructure, agriculture and cities. It will still be hard work, especially

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
to get the right policies passed and enacted. But for the first time ever, there are a few trend

110
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,800
lines pointing solidly in the right direction. And now imagine if all of this was achieved without

111
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,160
proper financial and political support. And despite fossil fuel lobbying, just think what

112
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,280
humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs.

113
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,920
So is it okay to feel hopeful again? The situation is still dire and serious. So what's the point of

114
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,080
focusing on this side of the story? The trap of hopelessness. Climate change can feel overwhelming

115
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,000
and make your future seem bleak. The sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real

116
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,440
and very destructive, because it causes apathy. Apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel

117
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,080
industry that is still delaying change however it can. In a sense, they have weaponized hopelessness.

118
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
We are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action.

119
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Phase one was, climate change is not real. Phase two was, climate change is real, but not caused

120
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,840
by humans. Phase three was, climate change may be caused by humans, but it's not that bad.

121
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,160
Phase four is, climate change is no longer avoidable. We are doomed and it doesn't matter

122
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,160
what we do. If we want the world to change, we first need to believe that change is possible.

123
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,360
And we have an abundance of evidence that it is. Changes to our industrial system are gaining

124
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
momentum. Technology gets better and cheaper. Climate change has become a key issue in most

125
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,520
free elections. As more and more younger people move into influential positions, they prioritize

126
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,680
climate change and work on new solutions. In 2022, most governments not only acknowledge it,

127
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,560
but set their own net zero goals in democratic and autocratic countries. The results of years

128
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,400
of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible. The pressure needs to keep increasing

129
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,560
to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept. Climate doomerism is the

130
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,760
equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case, but also mitigate

131
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,480
most of the bad things, make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from

132
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,080
suffering. That is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous. If the last in many ways wasted

133
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,400
decade has shown anything, then it's the progress is being made. And that dire scenarios are just

134
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,600
predictions, not our sealed fate. As of 2022, based on current global policies, we will end up

135
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,840
in a three degrees world. Now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong, despite how

136
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,520
serious and urgent things are. To turn that three degrees into a two degrees, and then see where we

137
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:32,880
can go from there. For that, we need hope. And we hope we gave you that today, at least a little.

138
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,000
That you feel that things are serious, but also that you have a future. That you could have kids

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,240
without dooming them or the world. That taking action today is worth it. And that despite

140
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,320
powerful industries doing everything to delay it, society is changing. If you need a more concrete

141
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
roadmap of what you can do personally, we're working on a follow up video to talk about that

142
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,160
in greater detail. Doomerism, inactivity and weaponized hopelessness are the only trump cards

143
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:12,240
left for the powers that don't want change. Don't let them win. We're still excited about the future.

144
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,840
And we think one of the best things you can do to keep your optimism and curiosity up is to learn

145
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,840
new things. If you don't know where to start, our friends from brilliant.org have got you covered.

146
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,280
Brilliant makes maths and science accessible and fun with a hands on approach. More than 60

147
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,160
interactive courses like the joy of problem solving or scientific thinking, give you the

148
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,720
tools to crack problems in maths, science and computer science that are all designed to get

149
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,400
your intuition going and give you plenty of experiences. Lessons will surprise you with

150
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,200
storytelling code writing tasks and interactive challenges. Basically using whatever keeps you

151
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,800
interested and entertained. All the content is interactive. Instead of just reading and listening

152
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,080
to explanations, you drag and drop manipulate shapes and diagrams, make selections and answer

153
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,160
questions. This way you learn something almost without you noticing it. And tiny step by step,

154
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,400
you'll build up your long term understanding of science and get closer to your STEM goals.
