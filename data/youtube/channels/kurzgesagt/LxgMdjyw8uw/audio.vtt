00:00.880 --> 00:07.360
Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions

00:07.360 --> 00:11.680
will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming, and we may soon hit tipping points

00:11.680 --> 00:18.480
that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization. While scientists, activists,

00:18.480 --> 00:23.360
and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to

00:23.360 --> 00:28.560
doing anything meaningful, while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.240
It seems humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal

00:34.240 --> 00:39.840
gain to save itself. And so for many, the future looks grim and hopeless.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.360
Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a

00:45.360 --> 00:50.400
lifetime of opportunity, they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids

00:50.400 --> 00:56.720
into this world. It's an age of doom and hopelessness, and giving up seems the only

00:56.720 --> 01:04.320
sensible thing to do. But that's not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.

01:13.440 --> 01:18.800
Despite the seriousness of the situation, for years, positive trends have accumulated,

01:18.800 --> 01:24.320
and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our collective climate goals.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.160
Welcome to our TED talk. Please watch this video to the end. Check out our

01:28.160 --> 01:34.080
detailed sources afterwards to learn more. Okay, let's start with the scariest things.

01:35.440 --> 01:41.440
Canceling the apocalypse. Some of the most widely shared stories about climate change

01:41.440 --> 01:46.960
are that it is an existential threat, the end of human civilization, and maybe even our own

01:46.960 --> 01:52.080
extinction event, and that it is basically unavoidable now. But what does science actually

01:52.080 --> 01:59.040
say? As of 2022, the global average temperature has risen 1.2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial

01:59.040 --> 02:04.880
times. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement,

02:04.880 --> 02:11.120
but we are not likely to meet it. Already with the warming we have today, hot places will get hotter,

02:11.120 --> 02:16.480
wet places wetter, and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.040
Warming beyond 2 degrees makes all of these extremes more extreme. Extreme weather events

02:23.040 --> 02:28.560
more common, with more ecosystems under major pressure. Some will not survive.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.920
At 3 degrees, significant parts of Earth, especially in developing countries,

02:33.920 --> 02:38.880
might become unable to feed their populations. Heat waves will become a major global issue.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.800
Large-scale natural systems will break down. The scale and frequency of hurricanes, fires,

02:44.800 --> 02:50.880
and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage. Poor regions and subsistence

02:50.880 --> 02:55.920
farmers will be hit the hardest. Hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.560
In the 4-8 degree range, the apocalypse begins. The hot house Earth, where things change so

03:02.560 --> 03:08.640
quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions may perish,

03:08.640 --> 03:14.960
leaving the rest on a hostile alien planet. A decade ago, for lack of action and perspective,

03:14.960 --> 03:20.560
many scientists assumed a 4-plus degree world was our future, and a lot of public communication

03:20.560 --> 03:26.240
focused on exactly this future path. Luckily, it's much less likely that this version of the

03:26.240 --> 03:32.480
apocalypse will come to pass. If current climate policies stagnate, we're likely to end up with

03:32.480 --> 03:40.240
warming of around 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. Which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.720
But this is actually good news. How? In the last decade, we've seen enough progress that

03:46.720 --> 03:52.160
most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change. Although

03:52.160 --> 03:57.120
substantial risk still remains, we can pretty confidently say that humanity isn't going

03:57.120 --> 04:03.680
anywhere. Civilization might have to change, but it will endure. Which begs the question,

04:04.240 --> 04:10.640
what has changed over the last 10 years? And is this really good news? The invisible shift.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.480
You probably know this story. The last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies

04:16.480 --> 04:21.440
around the world. Instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce

04:21.440 --> 04:27.360
emissions, we mostly did nothing. A lost decade with one negative record after another.

04:27.920 --> 04:33.440
And this story is true, and it's one reason why so many people are giving up. But it is not the

04:33.440 --> 04:39.040
whole picture. Despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation

04:39.040 --> 04:44.960
campaigns from the fossil fuel industries, there was a lot of progress. Let's go back 20 years

04:44.960 --> 04:53.040
to see why today is so different. Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24%,

04:53.840 --> 04:59.120
three times as much as the increase in the previous decade. Subsidies for fossil fuels

04:59.120 --> 05:03.680
aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.800
For developing countries like China and India, coal was the cheapest fuel for growth,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.760
while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways.

05:12.400 --> 05:17.920
In 2010, many people expected these trends to continue. Instead of decreasing fossil fuel use,

05:17.920 --> 05:22.640
its consumption would rise. The next decade turned out to be very different, though.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.680
First of all, coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down,

05:27.680 --> 05:33.200
or levelled off, like in China. And it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and US.

05:34.080 --> 05:39.360
Since 2015, three quarters of planned coal plants have been cancelled, and 44 countries have

05:39.360 --> 05:44.240
committed to stop building them. Ten years ago, that would have seemed like wishful thinking.

05:44.240 --> 05:50.240
But today we can say with confidence, coal is dying. It's just not competitive anymore.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.800
Because technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.680
Renewable electricity has shown explosive progress. In a mere decade, wind energy got

06:01.680 --> 06:08.080
three times cheaper. Solar electricity is now ten times cheaper. Cheaper than coal or any other

06:08.080 --> 06:13.200
fossil fuel burning power plant, despite the massive subsidies and global infrastructure

06:13.200 --> 06:19.920
propping up fossil fuels. 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity

06:19.920 --> 06:24.160
is produced today compared with ten years ago, which is of course not nearly enough.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.480
One of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output.

06:29.120 --> 06:34.320
Renewables need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source, like expensive batteries.

06:34.960 --> 06:42.560
Amazingly, battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years, 60% in the last decade alone,

06:42.560 --> 06:45.920
which will serve all kinds of green technology like electric cars.

06:46.880 --> 06:51.040
You might say, well that's great, but didn't Kurzgesagt's last climate video

06:51.040 --> 06:55.760
say that while wind and solar are nice, we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of

06:55.760 --> 07:01.520
our global industrial system? Yes, but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.640
Throughout the economy, people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions.

07:07.680 --> 07:13.360
We're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are ten times more efficient.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.400
In 2020, about seven out of ten new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid. In 2021,

07:20.400 --> 07:26.560
it was already eight out of ten. And the list goes on, from electric heating and better insulation

07:26.560 --> 07:32.320
to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel. Wherever you look, you find scientists, engineers

07:32.320 --> 07:37.920
and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change. Enormous amounts of human

07:37.920 --> 07:42.000
ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem, with more and more people deciding

07:42.000 --> 07:48.720
to prioritize preventing rapid climate change. Solutions for low carbon production of cement,

07:48.720 --> 07:53.680
electronics and steel, and innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the

07:53.680 --> 07:59.120
works. The more of these technologies we deploy, the cheaper new and better technology gets.

07:59.840 --> 08:05.360
The cheaper they get, the more people use them, and so on. We can see the impact already. The

08:05.360 --> 08:11.360
domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession. Since the year 2000,

08:11.360 --> 08:21.200
the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease, Italy 28%, the UK 35%, Denmark 43%. But the best news may be

08:21.200 --> 08:26.800
that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth. In the past, this was

08:26.800 --> 08:32.320
an inconvenient truth. To get richer, you had to emit more, which led to fierce arguments between

08:32.320 --> 08:36.400
developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their

08:36.400 --> 08:41.360
populations were still poor. But in the last decade, we've seen that it is possible to increase

08:41.360 --> 08:47.440
prosperity without increasing emissions. Emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP

08:47.440 --> 08:57.360
grew by 27%. France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14%, while increasing GDP by 15%. Romania saw

08:57.360 --> 09:04.640
an 8% decrease and 35% growth. And even the largest economy on earth, the USA, decreased

09:04.640 --> 09:12.320
emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26%. Some of you may call this a numbers trick, that

09:12.320 --> 09:16.720
rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer nations by moving the dirty parts of their

09:16.720 --> 09:22.080
economies like manufacturing. But even when we account for all of our imported goods, the numbers

09:22.080 --> 09:27.280
still look positive. It's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the

09:27.280 --> 09:33.120
climate as it seemed to be a decade ago. Developing countries will profit from that because as rich

09:33.120 --> 09:37.760
countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies, they can adopt them more

09:37.760 --> 09:42.320
cheaply. They can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through.

09:42.960 --> 09:49.440
We are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision. And we haven't even

09:49.440 --> 09:56.320
really talked about solutions like carbon capture. In 2000, it didn't really exist. In 2022, that

09:56.320 --> 10:01.920
technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere.

10:02.640 --> 10:07.920
As investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale, it's likely that these costs

10:07.920 --> 10:13.920
will plummet over the next few decades. So everything's fine then. Well, let's not get carried

10:13.920 --> 10:19.680
away. All of these processes are great, but not nearly fast enough. We're still doing way too little

10:19.680 --> 10:25.680
and technology will not magically solve everything. We need to use fewer resources and use them longer,

10:25.680 --> 10:30.880
design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements.

10:31.440 --> 10:37.200
We need much better infrastructure, agriculture and cities. It will still be hard work, especially

10:37.200 --> 10:42.720
to get the right policies passed and enacted. But for the first time ever, there are a few trend

10:42.720 --> 10:48.800
lines pointing solidly in the right direction. And now imagine if all of this was achieved without

10:48.800 --> 10:54.160
proper financial and political support. And despite fossil fuel lobbying, just think what

10:54.160 --> 10:59.280
humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs.

10:59.840 --> 11:05.920
So is it okay to feel hopeful again? The situation is still dire and serious. So what's the point of

11:05.920 --> 11:14.080
focusing on this side of the story? The trap of hopelessness. Climate change can feel overwhelming

11:14.080 --> 11:20.000
and make your future seem bleak. The sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real

11:20.000 --> 11:25.440
and very destructive, because it causes apathy. Apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel

11:25.440 --> 11:32.080
industry that is still delaying change however it can. In a sense, they have weaponized hopelessness.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.120
We are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action.

11:37.840 --> 11:44.560
Phase one was, climate change is not real. Phase two was, climate change is real, but not caused

11:44.560 --> 11:49.840
by humans. Phase three was, climate change may be caused by humans, but it's not that bad.

11:50.560 --> 11:56.160
Phase four is, climate change is no longer avoidable. We are doomed and it doesn't matter

11:56.160 --> 12:02.160
what we do. If we want the world to change, we first need to believe that change is possible.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.360
And we have an abundance of evidence that it is. Changes to our industrial system are gaining

12:07.360 --> 12:12.320
momentum. Technology gets better and cheaper. Climate change has become a key issue in most

12:12.320 --> 12:17.520
free elections. As more and more younger people move into influential positions, they prioritize

12:17.520 --> 12:23.680
climate change and work on new solutions. In 2022, most governments not only acknowledge it,

12:23.680 --> 12:30.560
but set their own net zero goals in democratic and autocratic countries. The results of years

12:30.560 --> 12:36.400
of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible. The pressure needs to keep increasing

12:36.400 --> 12:42.560
to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept. Climate doomerism is the

12:42.560 --> 12:47.760
equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case, but also mitigate

12:47.760 --> 12:52.480
most of the bad things, make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from

12:52.480 --> 13:00.080
suffering. That is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous. If the last in many ways wasted

13:00.080 --> 13:06.400
decade has shown anything, then it's the progress is being made. And that dire scenarios are just

13:06.400 --> 13:13.600
predictions, not our sealed fate. As of 2022, based on current global policies, we will end up

13:13.600 --> 13:19.840
in a three degrees world. Now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong, despite how

13:19.840 --> 13:25.520
serious and urgent things are. To turn that three degrees into a two degrees, and then see where we

13:25.520 --> 13:32.880
can go from there. For that, we need hope. And we hope we gave you that today, at least a little.

13:32.880 --> 13:38.000
That you feel that things are serious, but also that you have a future. That you could have kids

13:38.000 --> 13:44.240
without dooming them or the world. That taking action today is worth it. And that despite

13:44.240 --> 13:50.320
powerful industries doing everything to delay it, society is changing. If you need a more concrete

13:50.320 --> 13:54.800
roadmap of what you can do personally, we're working on a follow up video to talk about that

13:54.800 --> 14:02.160
in greater detail. Doomerism, inactivity and weaponized hopelessness are the only trump cards

14:02.160 --> 14:12.240
left for the powers that don't want change. Don't let them win. We're still excited about the future.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.840
And we think one of the best things you can do to keep your optimism and curiosity up is to learn

14:17.840 --> 14:23.840
new things. If you don't know where to start, our friends from brilliant.org have got you covered.
