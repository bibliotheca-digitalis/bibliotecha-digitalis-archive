1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
A lot of things can be beautiful.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Landscapes, faces, fine art, or epic architecture.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Stars in the sky.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its colour, shape, form or proportion somehow are appealing or delightful to us.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even our first tools were trimmed to a symmetrical shape.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the time to make their tools look nice but couldn't really identify any.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops simply because they liked them better that way.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Throughout our history, the definition of beauty has changed a lot.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ideals have shifted or turned into their opposites.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But beyond individual and contemporary taste, some things have never really gone out of fashion.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The golden ratio, symmetry or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of cultures from our beginnings to today.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Humans seem to be in mysterious inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Fractal patterns, for example, occur all over nature, in snail shells, flower heads, waves or clouds.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do those clouds mean rain will come soon? Are these waters safe to swim through? Can I eat this?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Another pervasive thing is symmetry. In nature, it means everything is as it should be.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stems and trees and leaves and blossoms all grow symmetrically.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A deer with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A deformed wheat ear may not be safe to eat.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A symmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile mating partner.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora, it's extremely familiar to our brain.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily and react quickly to danger.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Things that help us survive activate the reward center in our brain.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Recognizing signals of safety and nutrition trigger nice feelings in us.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But it goes way beyond that now.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into us.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It remains even after other processes in our brain stop working.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The patients had long since forgotten the paintings, but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
One could argue that this doesn't say much, so what if people stick to their personal preferences?

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator when it comes to beauty.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In different experiments, people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict rules like fractal patterns, while the imitations were not.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The majority picked out the original artworks.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This worked with paintings from both artists, even though their styles are very different.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Another experiment also used abstract artworks, but asked people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children or animals.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Again, the test subjects pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were carefully planned and not random.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what it's based on, we somehow recognize it when we see it.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We left the natural world behind and created our own.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We made the objects that surround us, the things we wear and use and look at.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew, we shaped a completely man-made environment.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In the process of doing so, we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality, cost or efficiency.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We built rows and rows of concrete housing blocks that nobody wants to live in.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We have ugly underground subway stations, shabby public service buildings and sprawling walls.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
One bland standardized box beside the next.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Humans don't like monotony.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Eye tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and ornaments of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And not only are they no fun to look at, they actually make us miserable.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Experiments with skin sensors showed that looking at vast, dull facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And the opposite seems to be true too.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Over the last decades, more and more studies have found that surroundings that are actually aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our well-being, our behavior, cognitive function and mood.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Our bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds us.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our well-being that making useful things beautiful can actually make them better.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In 2017, a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas made them more comfortable and happier about their stay in general.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two wards.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A very old and rather ugly one and a newly renovated ward.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To the researcher's surprise, the patients that stayed in the new renovated environment needed less pain medication and were released on average two days earlier than patients recovering in the old ward.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
More beautiful surroundings made them feel better physically.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Beauty also has an effect on us on a daily basis.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It can improve our general happiness.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults revealed an unexpected result.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Besides things like good health and a harmonious family life, individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, what can we learn from all of this?

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We know that we humans have been fine-tuned for millions of years to process visual input and assess our surroundings.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how much beauty as a property is really influencing us.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Beauty meets an inherent need for meaningful information.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe it would be worth giving it more space in this man-made world we have created.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies Zagmeister and Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming beauty exhibition.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The exhibition will be shown at the Mark Vienna from October 23, 2018 until March 31, 2019 and the Mark Frankfurt from May 1 until September 30, 2019.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
