0	3000	A lot of things can be beautiful.
3000	8000	Landscapes, faces, fine art, or epic architecture.
8000	10000	Stars in the sky.
10000	13000	Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle.
13000	19000	Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling.
19000	28000	If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its colour, shape, form or proportion somehow are appealing or delightful to us.
28000	32000	Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years.
32000	36000	Even our first tools were trimmed to a symmetrical shape.
36000	44000	Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the time to make their tools look nice but couldn't really identify any.
44000	51000	It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops simply because they liked them better that way.
51000	55000	Throughout our history, the definition of beauty has changed a lot.
55000	58000	Ideals have shifted or turned into their opposites.
58000	64000	But beyond individual and contemporary taste, some things have never really gone out of fashion.
64000	72000	The golden ratio, symmetry or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of cultures from our beginnings to today.
72000	78000	Humans seem to be in mysterious inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things.
78000	82000	The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature.
82000	87000	They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive.
92000	99000	Fractal patterns, for example, occur all over nature, in snail shells, flower heads, waves or clouds.
99000	104000	Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital.
104000	111000	Do those clouds mean rain will come soon? Are these waters safe to swim through? Can I eat this?
111000	116000	Another pervasive thing is symmetry. In nature, it means everything is as it should be.
116000	120000	Stems and trees and leaves and blossoms all grow symmetrically.
120000	124000	A deer with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat.
124000	127000	A deformed wheat ear may not be safe to eat.
127000	133000	A symmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile mating partner.
133000	139000	Because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora, it's extremely familiar to our brain.
139000	145000	It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily and react quickly to danger.
145000	149000	Things that help us survive activate the reward center in our brain.
149000	154000	Recognizing signals of safety and nutrition trigger nice feelings in us.
154000	158000	So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition.
158000	160000	But it goes way beyond that now.
160000	165000	Humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into us.
165000	170000	It remains even after other processes in our brain stop working.
170000	175000	Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings.
175000	178000	Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later.
178000	184000	The patients had long since forgotten the paintings, but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order.
184000	190000	One could argue that this doesn't say much, so what if people stick to their personal preferences?
190000	195000	But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator when it comes to beauty.
195000	200000	In different experiments, people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings.
200000	207000	Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict rules like fractal patterns, while the imitations were not.
207000	210000	The majority picked out the original artworks.
210000	216000	This worked with paintings from both artists, even though their styles are very different.
216000	224000	Another experiment also used abstract artworks, but asked people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children or animals.
224000	230000	Again, the test subjects pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were carefully planned and not random.
230000	237000	So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what it's based on, we somehow recognize it when we see it.
237000	247000	Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore.
247000	250000	We left the natural world behind and created our own.
250000	255000	We made the objects that surround us, the things we wear and use and look at.
255000	261000	As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew, we shaped a completely man-made environment.
261000	267000	In the process of doing so, we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality, cost or efficiency.
267000	272000	We built rows and rows of concrete housing blocks that nobody wants to live in.
272000	278000	We have ugly underground subway stations, shabby public service buildings and sprawling walls.
278000	281000	One bland standardized box beside the next.
281000	283000	Humans don't like monotony.
283000	290000	Eye tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and ornaments of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls.
290000	294000	And not only are they no fun to look at, they actually make us miserable.
294000	301000	Experiments with skin sensors showed that looking at vast, dull facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable.
301000	305000	This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels.
305000	307000	And the opposite seems to be true too.
307000	317000	Over the last decades, more and more studies have found that surroundings that are actually aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our well-being, our behavior, cognitive function and mood.
317000	322000	Our bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds us.
322000	330000	Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our well-being that making useful things beautiful can actually make them better.
330000	343000	In 2017, a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas made them more comfortable and happier about their stay in general.
344000	349000	Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two wards.
349000	353000	A very old and rather ugly one and a newly renovated ward.
353000	363000	To the researcher's surprise, the patients that stayed in the new renovated environment needed less pain medication and were released on average two days earlier than patients recovering in the old ward.
363000	367000	More beautiful surroundings made them feel better physically.
367000	370000	Beauty also has an effect on us on a daily basis.
370000	372000	It can improve our general happiness.
372000	378000	A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults revealed an unexpected result.
378000	386000	Besides things like good health and a harmonious family life, individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in.
386000	390000	Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety.
390000	393000	So, what can we learn from all of this?
393000	400000	We know that we humans have been fine-tuned for millions of years to process visual input and assess our surroundings.
400000	408000	It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how much beauty as a property is really influencing us.
408000	412000	Beauty meets an inherent need for meaningful information.
412000	417000	Maybe it would be worth giving it more space in this man-made world we have created.
419000	427000	This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies Zagmeister and Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming beauty exhibition.
427000	438000	The exhibition will be shown at the Mark Vienna from October 23, 2018 until March 31, 2019 and the Mark Frankfurt from May 1 until September 30, 2019.
438000	446000	If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multimedia objects, go check it out.
