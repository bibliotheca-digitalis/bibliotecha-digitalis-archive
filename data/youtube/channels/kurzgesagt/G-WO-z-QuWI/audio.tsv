880	5600	Leaving Earth to find new homes in space is an old dream of humanity,
5600	8880	and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival.
9600	15600	The planet that gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic, and energy-poor planet
15600	20560	that just about seems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities.
21280	26240	But what if we think bigger? What if we take Venus, one of the most hostile and
26240	32800	deadly places in the solar system, and turn it into a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities,
32800	37680	but by creating a proper second Earth. It might be easier than you think.
47120	51440	Venus is by far the hottest planet in the solar system, with a surface temperature of
51440	59520	460Â°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat is due to the most extreme greenhouse effect in the solar
59520	68320	system. CO2 is great at trapping heat. Even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in Earth's atmosphere
68320	76800	is heating up our planet right now. Venus' atmosphere is 97% CO2. Also, Venus' atmosphere
76800	82320	is 93 times denser than Earth's. Standing on Venus' surface would feel like taking a dive
82320	86880	about 900 meters deep into the ocean. The pressure would kill you instantly.
87600	90800	It's a truly horrible place, so why should we even bother?
92000	97280	First and foremost, Venus is almost as big as Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity.
97920	102480	Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing the solar system because it's very likely that
102480	108320	long stays in low-gravity places will have negative health effects. Venus' size means
108320	114080	it could be the second largest habitat in the solar system. A new home for billions of humans
114080	119360	and trillions of animals, with oceans, lush forests, and a beautiful blue sky.
120080	124800	A properly terraformed Venus may be the most pleasant place to live outside of Earth.
125680	131360	While we can't exactly terraform Venus today, a slightly more ambitious future version of us
131360	136960	could take this project on. It will take a few generations to complete and be a huge challenge,
136960	141840	like building the Great Pyramids was for our ancestors. But then, it's not like humans have
141840	147200	never started projects that took more than a lifetime to complete. Okay, let's do it.
148000	153120	Before anything else, we need to cool Venus down and remove the gas that makes up the extremely
153120	160080	heavy atmosphere. As mentioned, there's a lot of it. Around 465 million billion tons.
160800	166320	How do we do that? There are a few options. We could create giant solar collectors powering a
166320	171040	huge array of laser beams that heat up the atmosphere so much that it's blasted into space.
171600	176640	Although we would need thousands of times the entire power-generating capacity of humanity,
176640	181840	and it would still take thousands of years to remove the atmosphere. Another way is to
181840	187360	sequester the atmosphere, binding the CO2 in different compounds through chemical reactions.
188000	193280	We could mine elements like calcium or magnesium on Mercury and shoot them at Venus via mass
193280	199920	driver systems, electric rails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller planets. The metals would
199920	206080	combine to bind the CO2 into different carbonates basically forever. But the scale makes the whole
206080	212720	thing impractical. We would need several hundred billion tons of material to sequester the CO2 this
212720	219280	way. Seems like a waste of material and might take too long. An equally ridiculous idea that
219280	226240	could actually work is to put Venus in the shade, literally, by constructing a huge mirror to blot
226240	231760	out the sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The mirror doesn't need to be complex or massive,
231760	237200	just a very thin foil with a little structural support. Building such a large flat surface so
237200	241920	close to the sun will turn it effectively into a solar sail and push it out of position,
241920	246960	so instead of one giant circular object, our mirror will consist of many different pieces.
247680	252560	Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect sunlight from one set of mirrors to the next.
252560	257600	Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light from one to another until the light is redirected to
257600	263280	the back, balancing the force on the front and holding them in position. After a few years of
263280	269920	getting the infrastructure in place, things start slowly and then escalate. For the first few decades,
269920	276320	the atmosphere slowly cools down but stays dense and deadly until, after some 60 years,
276320	282880	it reaches the critical temperature of 31 degrees Celsius. Suddenly, the great flood begins on Venus
282880	289760	as CO2 turns to liquid at this pressure and begins to rain down. A constant global rainstorm of
289760	296080	unbelievable proportions lasting 30 years. The pressure and temperature suddenly begin to drop
296080	302800	in unison. For almost a century, puddles turn into lakes and oceans. The surface temperature
302800	308160	is now minus 56 degrees Celsius and the pressure has dropped to only seven times the pressure on
308160	314720	Earth. Finally, at a really unpleasant minus 81 degrees Celsius, the CO2 oceans begin to freeze
314720	320560	and the rain turns into snow. This leaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans as hard as rock
320560	327120	and gigantic CO2 glaciers. What remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen at about three times
327120	331840	Earth's surface pressure. If you don't mind freezing and suffocating, you can now take a
331840	337840	stroll over Venus's surface. But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem. At some point,
337840	343600	we want to warm up the planet but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill up the atmosphere again.
343600	348960	So we need some way to keep it from doing that. One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic
348960	354560	insulation and cover it up with ground up Venus rock or water oceans. Although some planetary
354560	359200	scientists will be very stressed out about us building a new planet containing a potential
359200	366000	time bomb like that. A few unfortunately timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at once and ruin
366000	371840	everything. Another obvious solution is to shoot it all out into space and collect it into a small
371840	377200	moon for storage and future use. We can make this more efficient by using mass drivers instead of
377200	382080	rockets, but moving all that mass will still be a pretty intense challenge that will take some time
382080	387360	to solve. Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere to move forward, we need water which
387360	393440	we could get from ice moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter has twice as much water as Earth's oceans.
394080	399680	Now catching a moon and transporting it through the solar system is not exactly easy. So instead,
399680	405440	it might be easier to cut chunks of ice off Europa with an army of construction drones and shoot them
405440	412000	at Venus using more of those mass drivers. Space tethers could save us a lot of effort and energy
412000	417120	here. We made a whole video explaining how they work, but in a nutshell they are slings that can
417120	424000	take a payload on both ends. On Europa, they do most of the work needed to catapult our ice to Venus.
424960	430800	The ice hits the Venus tethers which gently drop it into the atmosphere where it falls down as snow.
430800	437760	In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch CO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate it into
437760	443840	orbit. We can remove excess nitrogen using this same method to further lower our atmospheric
443840	450080	pressure. After a few decades or centuries, Venus would be covered by a nice shallow frozen ocean
450080	455920	a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely different from today. A few continents and
455920	462240	countless islands have formed. This is beginning to look a bit like our planet. Now the last and
462240	467920	most magnificent phase of terraforming begins, making the atmosphere breathable and adding life.
468720	475440	First, we need light though and we need to heat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2,802 hours
475440	482880	long, more than 116 Earth days. So if we just remove our giant mirror, we would grill half of
482880	488400	our planet. Even without the massive atmosphere, temperatures would reach unbearable levels.
489120	494240	The simplest way to create a day-night cycle and let some energy in again is with another set of
494240	499600	mirrors to illuminate our continents and melt our water oceans, which would let us completely
499600	505920	control how much energy we get and where it goes. The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen
505920	511920	and basically devoid of oxygen. So the first inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions
511920	518480	of cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesizing and release oxygen. We know that they can quickly
518480	522480	turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago, they were probably
522480	527520	responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosphere with enough
527520	534160	oxygen for more complex animal life. But not only that, cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the
534160	539840	atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can be used by living beings. This way, they will
539840	544640	essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex organisms.
545600	550880	On land, our colonists need to grind down some of the former Venusian surface to make soil for
550880	556720	nitrogen-fixing plants to grow on. Eventually, billions of trees would spread, creating large
556720	563920	forests covering massive parts of the continents. Venus would turn green. To speed things up,
563920	569760	CO2 would be strategically released to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas already covered
569760	574160	with plants could get extra daylight from our orbital mirrors so the plants would be active
574160	579040	for most of each day. Maybe we won't have to do this with the same plants and animals we know
579040	584480	today. As genetic engineering matures and our understanding of genetics and the machinery of
584480	590800	life expands, we might just engineer life as we need it. All in all, it would take several
590800	595680	thousand years to make the atmosphere breathable by humans. In the meantime, you could stroll
595680	601120	around with nothing more than regular clothes and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a vast
601120	606960	new planet filled with resources and bathed in sunlight. They might think of new ways to use the
606960	613440	vast amounts of carbon dioxide ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above, industrial processes,
613440	620000	rocket fuel, or even boosting the terraforming of another planet like tiny Mars. Venus is fully
620000	627600	terraformed. Animals roam through vast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed. Billions of settlers
627600	633680	and their descendants make this world their home. They will see images of the past. How Venus was
633680	639280	once the most hostile planet around. How it took hundreds of years to freeze hell and to ship in
639280	645280	the oceans and another few thousand years to make it possible to breathe freely. They will barely be
645280	652400	able to believe it. Okay, maybe it's not that easy to terraform Venus and a lot of things must go
652400	657920	right for this future to become reality. But it is possible and with technology that is within
657920	662800	the reach of a motivated and slightly more advanced humanity that wants to venture into space.

668960	675840	easy to overcome. If you think about it, your imagination is the only thing stopping you from
675840	680400	doing all kinds of things. All you need is a little nudge and we might just have the right
