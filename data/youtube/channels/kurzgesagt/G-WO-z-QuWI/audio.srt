1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,600
Leaving Earth to find new homes in space is an old dream of humanity,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,880
and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,600
The planet that gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic, and energy-poor planet

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,560
that just about seems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,240
But what if we think bigger? What if we take Venus, one of the most hostile and

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,800
deadly places in the solar system, and turn it into a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities,

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
but by creating a proper second Earth. It might be easier than you think.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
Venus is by far the hottest planet in the solar system, with a surface temperature of

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,520
460°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat is due to the most extreme greenhouse effect in the solar

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,320
system. CO2 is great at trapping heat. Even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in Earth's atmosphere

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:16,800
is heating up our planet right now. Venus' atmosphere is 97% CO2. Also, Venus' atmosphere

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,320
is 93 times denser than Earth's. Standing on Venus' surface would feel like taking a dive

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,880
about 900 meters deep into the ocean. The pressure would kill you instantly.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,800
It's a truly horrible place, so why should we even bother?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,280
First and foremost, Venus is almost as big as Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity.

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,480
Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing the solar system because it's very likely that

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,320
long stays in low-gravity places will have negative health effects. Venus' size means

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,080
it could be the second largest habitat in the solar system. A new home for billions of humans

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,360
and trillions of animals, with oceans, lush forests, and a beautiful blue sky.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,800
A properly terraformed Venus may be the most pleasant place to live outside of Earth.

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,360
While we can't exactly terraform Venus today, a slightly more ambitious future version of us

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,960
could take this project on. It will take a few generations to complete and be a huge challenge,

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,840
like building the Great Pyramids was for our ancestors. But then, it's not like humans have

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,200
never started projects that took more than a lifetime to complete. Okay, let's do it.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Before anything else, we need to cool Venus down and remove the gas that makes up the extremely

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,080
heavy atmosphere. As mentioned, there's a lot of it. Around 465 million billion tons.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,320
How do we do that? There are a few options. We could create giant solar collectors powering a

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,040
huge array of laser beams that heat up the atmosphere so much that it's blasted into space.

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,640
Although we would need thousands of times the entire power-generating capacity of humanity,

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
and it would still take thousands of years to remove the atmosphere. Another way is to

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,360
sequester the atmosphere, binding the CO2 in different compounds through chemical reactions.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,280
We could mine elements like calcium or magnesium on Mercury and shoot them at Venus via mass

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,920
driver systems, electric rails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller planets. The metals would

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,080
combine to bind the CO2 into different carbonates basically forever. But the scale makes the whole

35
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,720
thing impractical. We would need several hundred billion tons of material to sequester the CO2 this

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,280
way. Seems like a waste of material and might take too long. An equally ridiculous idea that

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,240
could actually work is to put Venus in the shade, literally, by constructing a huge mirror to blot

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,760
out the sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The mirror doesn't need to be complex or massive,

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
just a very thin foil with a little structural support. Building such a large flat surface so

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
close to the sun will turn it effectively into a solar sail and push it out of position,

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,960
so instead of one giant circular object, our mirror will consist of many different pieces.

42
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect sunlight from one set of mirrors to the next.

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,600
Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light from one to another until the light is redirected to

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,280
the back, balancing the force on the front and holding them in position. After a few years of

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,920
getting the infrastructure in place, things start slowly and then escalate. For the first few decades,

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,320
the atmosphere slowly cools down but stays dense and deadly until, after some 60 years,

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,880
it reaches the critical temperature of 31 degrees Celsius. Suddenly, the great flood begins on Venus

48
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,760
as CO2 turns to liquid at this pressure and begins to rain down. A constant global rainstorm of

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,080
unbelievable proportions lasting 30 years. The pressure and temperature suddenly begin to drop

50
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,800
in unison. For almost a century, puddles turn into lakes and oceans. The surface temperature

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,160
is now minus 56 degrees Celsius and the pressure has dropped to only seven times the pressure on

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,720
Earth. Finally, at a really unpleasant minus 81 degrees Celsius, the CO2 oceans begin to freeze

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,560
and the rain turns into snow. This leaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans as hard as rock

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,120
and gigantic CO2 glaciers. What remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen at about three times

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
Earth's surface pressure. If you don't mind freezing and suffocating, you can now take a

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,840
stroll over Venus's surface. But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem. At some point,

57
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,600
we want to warm up the planet but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill up the atmosphere again.

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,960
So we need some way to keep it from doing that. One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,560
insulation and cover it up with ground up Venus rock or water oceans. Although some planetary

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,200
scientists will be very stressed out about us building a new planet containing a potential

61
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,000
time bomb like that. A few unfortunately timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at once and ruin

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,840
everything. Another obvious solution is to shoot it all out into space and collect it into a small

63
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,200
moon for storage and future use. We can make this more efficient by using mass drivers instead of

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,080
rockets, but moving all that mass will still be a pretty intense challenge that will take some time

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,360
to solve. Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere to move forward, we need water which

66
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,440
we could get from ice moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter has twice as much water as Earth's oceans.

67
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,680
Now catching a moon and transporting it through the solar system is not exactly easy. So instead,

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,440
it might be easier to cut chunks of ice off Europa with an army of construction drones and shoot them

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,000
at Venus using more of those mass drivers. Space tethers could save us a lot of effort and energy

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
here. We made a whole video explaining how they work, but in a nutshell they are slings that can

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,000
take a payload on both ends. On Europa, they do most of the work needed to catapult our ice to Venus.

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,800
The ice hits the Venus tethers which gently drop it into the atmosphere where it falls down as snow.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,760
In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch CO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate it into

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,840
orbit. We can remove excess nitrogen using this same method to further lower our atmospheric

75
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,080
pressure. After a few decades or centuries, Venus would be covered by a nice shallow frozen ocean

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,920
a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely different from today. A few continents and

77
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,240
countless islands have formed. This is beginning to look a bit like our planet. Now the last and

78
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,920
most magnificent phase of terraforming begins, making the atmosphere breathable and adding life.

79
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,440
First, we need light though and we need to heat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2,802 hours

80
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,880
long, more than 116 Earth days. So if we just remove our giant mirror, we would grill half of

81
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,400
our planet. Even without the massive atmosphere, temperatures would reach unbearable levels.

82
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,240
The simplest way to create a day-night cycle and let some energy in again is with another set of

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,600
mirrors to illuminate our continents and melt our water oceans, which would let us completely

84
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,920
control how much energy we get and where it goes. The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen

85
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,920
and basically devoid of oxygen. So the first inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions

86
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,480
of cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesizing and release oxygen. We know that they can quickly

87
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,480
turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago, they were probably

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,520
responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosphere with enough

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,160
oxygen for more complex animal life. But not only that, cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the

90
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,840
atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can be used by living beings. This way, they will

91
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,640
essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex organisms.

92
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,880
On land, our colonists need to grind down some of the former Venusian surface to make soil for

93
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,720
nitrogen-fixing plants to grow on. Eventually, billions of trees would spread, creating large

94
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,920
forests covering massive parts of the continents. Venus would turn green. To speed things up,

95
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,760
CO2 would be strategically released to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas already covered

96
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
with plants could get extra daylight from our orbital mirrors so the plants would be active

97
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
for most of each day. Maybe we won't have to do this with the same plants and animals we know

98
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,480
today. As genetic engineering matures and our understanding of genetics and the machinery of

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,800
life expands, we might just engineer life as we need it. All in all, it would take several

100
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
thousand years to make the atmosphere breathable by humans. In the meantime, you could stroll

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,120
around with nothing more than regular clothes and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a vast

102
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,960
new planet filled with resources and bathed in sunlight. They might think of new ways to use the

103
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,440
vast amounts of carbon dioxide ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above, industrial processes,

104
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,000
rocket fuel, or even boosting the terraforming of another planet like tiny Mars. Venus is fully

105
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,600
terraformed. Animals roam through vast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed. Billions of settlers

106
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,680
and their descendants make this world their home. They will see images of the past. How Venus was

107
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,280
once the most hostile planet around. How it took hundreds of years to freeze hell and to ship in

108
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,280
the oceans and another few thousand years to make it possible to breathe freely. They will barely be

109
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,400
able to believe it. Okay, maybe it's not that easy to terraform Venus and a lot of things must go

110
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,920
right for this future to become reality. But it is possible and with technology that is within

111
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,800
the reach of a motivated and slightly more advanced humanity that wants to venture into space.

112
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,960
The only thing that's stopping it is our imagination and that at least is a problem that's

113
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,840
easy to overcome. If you think about it, your imagination is the only thing stopping you from

114
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,400
doing all kinds of things. All you need is a little nudge and we might just have the right

115
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,000
thing to get you started. We are big fans of Skillshare, an online learning community that
