00:00.880 --> 00:05.600
Leaving Earth to find new homes in space is an old dream of humanity,

00:05.600 --> 00:08.880
and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.600
The planet that gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic, and energy-poor planet

00:15.600 --> 00:20.560
that just about seems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.240
But what if we think bigger? What if we take Venus, one of the most hostile and

00:26.240 --> 00:32.800
deadly places in the solar system, and turn it into a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities,

00:32.800 --> 00:37.680
but by creating a proper second Earth. It might be easier than you think.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.440
Venus is by far the hottest planet in the solar system, with a surface temperature of

00:51.440 --> 00:59.520
460Â°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat is due to the most extreme greenhouse effect in the solar

00:59.520 --> 01:08.320
system. CO2 is great at trapping heat. Even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in Earth's atmosphere

01:08.320 --> 01:16.800
is heating up our planet right now. Venus' atmosphere is 97% CO2. Also, Venus' atmosphere

01:16.800 --> 01:22.320
is 93 times denser than Earth's. Standing on Venus' surface would feel like taking a dive

01:22.320 --> 01:26.880
about 900 meters deep into the ocean. The pressure would kill you instantly.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.800
It's a truly horrible place, so why should we even bother?

01:32.000 --> 01:37.280
First and foremost, Venus is almost as big as Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity.

01:37.920 --> 01:42.480
Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing the solar system because it's very likely that

01:42.480 --> 01:48.320
long stays in low-gravity places will have negative health effects. Venus' size means

01:48.320 --> 01:54.080
it could be the second largest habitat in the solar system. A new home for billions of humans

01:54.080 --> 01:59.360
and trillions of animals, with oceans, lush forests, and a beautiful blue sky.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.800
A properly terraformed Venus may be the most pleasant place to live outside of Earth.

02:05.680 --> 02:11.360
While we can't exactly terraform Venus today, a slightly more ambitious future version of us

02:11.360 --> 02:16.960
could take this project on. It will take a few generations to complete and be a huge challenge,

02:16.960 --> 02:21.840
like building the Great Pyramids was for our ancestors. But then, it's not like humans have

02:21.840 --> 02:27.200
never started projects that took more than a lifetime to complete. Okay, let's do it.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.120
Before anything else, we need to cool Venus down and remove the gas that makes up the extremely

02:33.120 --> 02:40.080
heavy atmosphere. As mentioned, there's a lot of it. Around 465 million billion tons.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.320
How do we do that? There are a few options. We could create giant solar collectors powering a

02:46.320 --> 02:51.040
huge array of laser beams that heat up the atmosphere so much that it's blasted into space.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.640
Although we would need thousands of times the entire power-generating capacity of humanity,

02:56.640 --> 03:01.840
and it would still take thousands of years to remove the atmosphere. Another way is to

03:01.840 --> 03:07.360
sequester the atmosphere, binding the CO2 in different compounds through chemical reactions.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.280
We could mine elements like calcium or magnesium on Mercury and shoot them at Venus via mass

03:13.280 --> 03:19.920
driver systems, electric rails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller planets. The metals would

03:19.920 --> 03:26.080
combine to bind the CO2 into different carbonates basically forever. But the scale makes the whole

03:26.080 --> 03:32.720
thing impractical. We would need several hundred billion tons of material to sequester the CO2 this

03:32.720 --> 03:39.280
way. Seems like a waste of material and might take too long. An equally ridiculous idea that

03:39.280 --> 03:46.240
could actually work is to put Venus in the shade, literally, by constructing a huge mirror to blot

03:46.240 --> 03:51.760
out the sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The mirror doesn't need to be complex or massive,

03:51.760 --> 03:57.200
just a very thin foil with a little structural support. Building such a large flat surface so

03:57.200 --> 04:01.920
close to the sun will turn it effectively into a solar sail and push it out of position,

04:01.920 --> 04:06.960
so instead of one giant circular object, our mirror will consist of many different pieces.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.560
Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect sunlight from one set of mirrors to the next.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.600
Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light from one to another until the light is redirected to

04:17.600 --> 04:23.280
the back, balancing the force on the front and holding them in position. After a few years of

04:23.280 --> 04:29.920
getting the infrastructure in place, things start slowly and then escalate. For the first few decades,

04:29.920 --> 04:36.320
the atmosphere slowly cools down but stays dense and deadly until, after some 60 years,

04:36.320 --> 04:42.880
it reaches the critical temperature of 31 degrees Celsius. Suddenly, the great flood begins on Venus

04:42.880 --> 04:49.760
as CO2 turns to liquid at this pressure and begins to rain down. A constant global rainstorm of

04:49.760 --> 04:56.080
unbelievable proportions lasting 30 years. The pressure and temperature suddenly begin to drop

04:56.080 --> 05:02.800
in unison. For almost a century, puddles turn into lakes and oceans. The surface temperature

05:02.800 --> 05:08.160
is now minus 56 degrees Celsius and the pressure has dropped to only seven times the pressure on

05:08.160 --> 05:14.720
Earth. Finally, at a really unpleasant minus 81 degrees Celsius, the CO2 oceans begin to freeze

05:14.720 --> 05:20.560
and the rain turns into snow. This leaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans as hard as rock

05:20.560 --> 05:27.120
and gigantic CO2 glaciers. What remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen at about three times

05:27.120 --> 05:31.840
Earth's surface pressure. If you don't mind freezing and suffocating, you can now take a

05:31.840 --> 05:37.840
stroll over Venus's surface. But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem. At some point,

05:37.840 --> 05:43.600
we want to warm up the planet but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill up the atmosphere again.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.960
So we need some way to keep it from doing that. One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic

05:48.960 --> 05:54.560
insulation and cover it up with ground up Venus rock or water oceans. Although some planetary

05:54.560 --> 05:59.200
scientists will be very stressed out about us building a new planet containing a potential

05:59.200 --> 06:06.000
time bomb like that. A few unfortunately timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at once and ruin

06:06.000 --> 06:11.840
everything. Another obvious solution is to shoot it all out into space and collect it into a small

06:11.840 --> 06:17.200
moon for storage and future use. We can make this more efficient by using mass drivers instead of

06:17.200 --> 06:22.080
rockets, but moving all that mass will still be a pretty intense challenge that will take some time

06:22.080 --> 06:27.360
to solve. Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere to move forward, we need water which

06:27.360 --> 06:33.440
we could get from ice moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter has twice as much water as Earth's oceans.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.680
Now catching a moon and transporting it through the solar system is not exactly easy. So instead,

06:39.680 --> 06:45.440
it might be easier to cut chunks of ice off Europa with an army of construction drones and shoot them

06:45.440 --> 06:52.000
at Venus using more of those mass drivers. Space tethers could save us a lot of effort and energy

06:52.000 --> 06:57.120
here. We made a whole video explaining how they work, but in a nutshell they are slings that can

06:57.120 --> 07:04.000
take a payload on both ends. On Europa, they do most of the work needed to catapult our ice to Venus.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.800
The ice hits the Venus tethers which gently drop it into the atmosphere where it falls down as snow.

07:10.800 --> 07:17.760
In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch CO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate it into

07:17.760 --> 07:23.840
orbit. We can remove excess nitrogen using this same method to further lower our atmospheric

07:23.840 --> 07:30.080
pressure. After a few decades or centuries, Venus would be covered by a nice shallow frozen ocean

07:30.080 --> 07:35.920
a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely different from today. A few continents and

07:35.920 --> 07:42.240
countless islands have formed. This is beginning to look a bit like our planet. Now the last and

07:42.240 --> 07:47.920
most magnificent phase of terraforming begins, making the atmosphere breathable and adding life.

07:48.720 --> 07:55.440
First, we need light though and we need to heat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2,802 hours

07:55.440 --> 08:02.880
long, more than 116 Earth days. So if we just remove our giant mirror, we would grill half of

08:02.880 --> 08:08.400
our planet. Even without the massive atmosphere, temperatures would reach unbearable levels.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.240
The simplest way to create a day-night cycle and let some energy in again is with another set of

08:14.240 --> 08:19.600
mirrors to illuminate our continents and melt our water oceans, which would let us completely

08:19.600 --> 08:25.920
control how much energy we get and where it goes. The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen

08:25.920 --> 08:31.920
and basically devoid of oxygen. So the first inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions

08:31.920 --> 08:38.480
of cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesizing and release oxygen. We know that they can quickly

08:38.480 --> 08:42.480
turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago, they were probably

08:42.480 --> 08:47.520
responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosphere with enough

08:47.520 --> 08:54.160
oxygen for more complex animal life. But not only that, cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the

08:54.160 --> 08:59.840
atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can be used by living beings. This way, they will

08:59.840 --> 09:04.640
essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex organisms.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.880
On land, our colonists need to grind down some of the former Venusian surface to make soil for

09:10.880 --> 09:16.720
nitrogen-fixing plants to grow on. Eventually, billions of trees would spread, creating large

09:16.720 --> 09:23.920
forests covering massive parts of the continents. Venus would turn green. To speed things up,

09:23.920 --> 09:29.760
CO2 would be strategically released to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas already covered

09:29.760 --> 09:34.160
with plants could get extra daylight from our orbital mirrors so the plants would be active

09:34.160 --> 09:39.040
for most of each day. Maybe we won't have to do this with the same plants and animals we know

09:39.040 --> 09:44.480
today. As genetic engineering matures and our understanding of genetics and the machinery of

09:44.480 --> 09:50.800
life expands, we might just engineer life as we need it. All in all, it would take several

09:50.800 --> 09:55.680
thousand years to make the atmosphere breathable by humans. In the meantime, you could stroll

09:55.680 --> 10:01.120
around with nothing more than regular clothes and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a vast

10:01.120 --> 10:06.960
new planet filled with resources and bathed in sunlight. They might think of new ways to use the

10:06.960 --> 10:13.440
vast amounts of carbon dioxide ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above, industrial processes,

10:13.440 --> 10:20.000
rocket fuel, or even boosting the terraforming of another planet like tiny Mars. Venus is fully

10:20.000 --> 10:27.600
terraformed. Animals roam through vast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed. Billions of settlers

10:27.600 --> 10:33.680
and their descendants make this world their home. They will see images of the past. How Venus was

10:33.680 --> 10:39.280
once the most hostile planet around. How it took hundreds of years to freeze hell and to ship in

10:39.280 --> 10:45.280
the oceans and another few thousand years to make it possible to breathe freely. They will barely be

10:45.280 --> 10:52.400
able to believe it. Okay, maybe it's not that easy to terraform Venus and a lot of things must go

10:52.400 --> 10:57.920
right for this future to become reality. But it is possible and with technology that is within

10:57.920 --> 11:02.800
the reach of a motivated and slightly more advanced humanity that wants to venture into space.

11:03.440 --> 11:08.960
The only thing that's stopping it is our imagination and that at least is a problem that's

11:08.960 --> 11:15.840
easy to overcome. If you think about it, your imagination is the only thing stopping you from

11:15.840 --> 11:20.400
doing all kinds of things. All you need is a little nudge and we might just have the right

11:20.400 --> 11:26.000
