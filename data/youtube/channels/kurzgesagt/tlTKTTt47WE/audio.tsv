880	5680	We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.
6320	10080	Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.
10720	15200	So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.
16000	19520	Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,
19520	22480	it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.
23440	28080	In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.
28800	32960	But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?
33760	37920	What if we are not creators, but creations?
38880	43040	Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?
53360	56160	If our current understanding of physics is correct,
56160	61440	then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.
61440	63280	But we don't actually need to anyway.
63920	68320	We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation
68320	69840	into thinking that they're real.
70480	72640	Who needs billions of galaxies?
72640	75840	We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.
77600	82160	The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.
82480	87440	What about small things like cells or bacteria?
88080	89200	We don't really need them.
90000	94000	When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.
95280	96400	Same with atoms.
96400	101520	The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.
101520	103840	We just need the outermost layer of it.
103840	107040	It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.
107920	111040	Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,
111040	113680	but it might be empty until you open it.
114960	120240	The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.
120880	124080	Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.
125120	127760	Okay, so are we being simulated?
128800	132480	Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.
133440	136240	Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,
136240	138720	so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.
139680	143760	Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom,
143760	145440	we have five assumptions for you.
146240	150640	If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.
152080	153360	Assumption one.
153360	155440	It's possible to simulate consciousness.
156880	158640	Nobody knows what consciousness is.
159280	164240	For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.
165120	167040	Brains are pretty complex.
169040	172400	If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation,
172400	180240	your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17, or 100 million billion operations per second.
180240	183600	Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations
183600	186400	to simulate one second of human consciousness.
186400	188880	But we don't want to simulate just one human.
188880	193520	We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.
193600	197600	Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.
198320	201600	One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years
201600	206000	times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.
207760	214320	So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.
215200	218640	More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.
219520	221680	A computer like this is just impossible.
222240	223760	Except maybe it isn't.
225520	226800	Assumption two.
226800	229440	Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.
231120	235840	If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,
235840	240720	then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.
241600	246080	Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.
246880	252000	A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,
252000	255040	but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.
256000	258800	The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure
258800	262480	made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.
263280	267280	A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands,
267280	270000	if not millions, of humanities at the same time.
270800	275920	Under technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically,
275920	280480	so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city or even smaller.
281200	284400	But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.
286160	287600	Assumption three.
287600	290480	Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.
291840	295200	If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves,
295200	296800	this whole discussion ends here.
297520	302720	Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations,
302720	303760	but we see nobody.
304480	306960	The reason for this might be great filters.
307840	310800	Great filters are barriers life has to overcome,
310800	315280	like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.
316240	320400	If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.
321120	324320	We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.
326080	326960	Assumption four.
327600	330960	Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.
330960	336240	When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.
337040	341360	To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.
342320	346240	Imagine the smartest ant on earth living next to an amusement park.
346240	349680	It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.
350800	353600	Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.
354160	358480	The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun
358480	361120	doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.
362160	365120	It's the same with us and a post-human being.
365120	367040	Compared to them, we are ants.
367600	372000	Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.
372880	377280	But if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons,
377280	380000	and assumptions one to three are true too,
380000	383680	then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.
385040	386000	Assumption five.
386480	390720	If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.
392000	396640	If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.
396640	401760	After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.
402400	407040	So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.
407760	410320	If there are billions of simulated universes,
410320	414640	there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,
414640	419120	which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed
419120	420080	are simulated.
421040	425440	So for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.
427280	430480	Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,
430480	438240	in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.
438240	442800	So what you consider reality might not be real at all.
442800	445280	You really might be simulated.
446800	450800	All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,
450800	454000	so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.
454800	457600	So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.
458320	461280	If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.
461920	464800	You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness
464800	467440	or a simulation inside a computer.
467440	470880	Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.
471600	475200	All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,
475200	479360	and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer,
479360	481040	nobody trips over the power cable.
484320	486480	Oh, oh, oh no.
487120	488640	I think I just unplugged the simulation.
489680	491680	But what if that doesn't matter?
491680	493440	What if we are in one right now?
494160	496720	What if you are simulated?
