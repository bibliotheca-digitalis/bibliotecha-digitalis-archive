00:00.880 --> 00:05.680
We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.

00:06.320 --> 00:10.080
Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.

00:10.720 --> 00:15.200
So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.520
Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,

00:19.520 --> 00:22.480
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.

00:23.440 --> 00:28.080
In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.960
But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?

00:33.760 --> 00:37.920
What if we are not creators, but creations?

00:38.880 --> 00:43.040
Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

00:53.360 --> 00:56.160
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

00:56.160 --> 01:01.440
then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.280
But we don't actually need to anyway.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.320
We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation

01:08.320 --> 01:09.840
into thinking that they're real.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.640
Who needs billions of galaxies?

01:12.640 --> 01:15.840
We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.160
The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.

01:22.480 --> 01:27.440
What about small things like cells or bacteria?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.200
We don't really need them.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.400
Same with atoms.

01:36.400 --> 01:41.520
The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.840
We just need the outermost layer of it.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.040
It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.040
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,

01:51.040 --> 01:53.680
but it might be empty until you open it.

01:54.960 --> 02:00.240
The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.080
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.760
Okay, so are we being simulated?

02:08.800 --> 02:12.480
Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.240
Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,

02:16.240 --> 02:18.720
so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.760
Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom,

02:23.760 --> 02:25.440
we have five assumptions for you.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.640
If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.360
Assumption one.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.440
It's possible to simulate consciousness.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.640
Nobody knows what consciousness is.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.240
For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.040
Brains are pretty complex.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.400
If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation,

02:52.400 --> 03:00.240
your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17, or 100 million billion operations per second.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.600
Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations

03:03.600 --> 03:06.400
to simulate one second of human consciousness.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.880
But we don't want to simulate just one human.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.520
We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.600
Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.600
One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years

03:21.600 --> 03:26.000
times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.

03:27.760 --> 03:34.320
So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.640
More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.680
A computer like this is just impossible.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.760
Except maybe it isn't.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.800
Assumption two.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.440
Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.840
If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,

03:55.840 --> 04:00.720
then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.080
Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.000
A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.040
but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.800
The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure

04:18.800 --> 04:22.480
made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.280
A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands,

04:27.280 --> 04:30.000
if not millions, of humanities at the same time.

04:30.800 --> 04:35.920
Under technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically,

04:35.920 --> 04:40.480
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city or even smaller.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.400
But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.600
Assumption three.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.480
Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.200
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves,

04:55.200 --> 04:56.800
this whole discussion ends here.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.720
Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations,

05:02.720 --> 05:03.760
but we see nobody.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.960
The reason for this might be great filters.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.800
Great filters are barriers life has to overcome,

05:10.800 --> 05:15.280
like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.

05:16.240 --> 05:20.400
If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.320
We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.

05:26.080 --> 05:26.960
Assumption four.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.960
Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.

05:30.960 --> 05:36.240
When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.360
To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.240
Imagine the smartest ant on earth living next to an amusement park.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.680
It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.600
Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.480
The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun

05:58.480 --> 06:01.120
doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.120
It's the same with us and a post-human being.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.040
Compared to them, we are ants.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.000
Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.280
But if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons,

06:17.280 --> 06:20.000
and assumptions one to three are true too,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.680
then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.000
Assumption five.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.720
If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.640
If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.

06:36.640 --> 06:41.760
After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.

06:42.400 --> 06:47.040
So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.320
If there are billions of simulated universes,

06:50.320 --> 06:54.640
there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,

06:54.640 --> 06:59.120
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed

06:59.120 --> 07:00.080
are simulated.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.440
So for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.480
Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,

07:10.480 --> 07:18.240
in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.800
So what you consider reality might not be real at all.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.280
You really might be simulated.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.800
All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,

07:30.800 --> 07:34.000
so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.280
If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.800
You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness

07:44.800 --> 07:47.440
or a simulation inside a computer.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.880
Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.200
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,

07:55.200 --> 07:59.360
and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer,

07:59.360 --> 08:01.040
nobody trips over the power cable.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.480
Oh, oh, oh no.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.640
I think I just unplugged the simulation.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.680
But what if that doesn't matter?

08:11.680 --> 08:13.440
What if we are in one right now?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.720
What if you are simulated?

08:17.600 --> 08:20.480
