1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,680
We humans are unable to experience the true nature of the universe unfiltered.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,080
Our senses and brains can only process a fraction of the world.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,200
So we have to use concepts and tools to learn about the true nature of reality.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,520
Technological progress not only widened our knowledge about the universe,

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,080
In the future, it might become possible to simulate entire universes.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened?

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
What if we are not creators, but creations?

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,040
Is it possible that we are not real and we don't even know it?

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
If our current understanding of physics is correct,

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,440
then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
But we don't actually need to anyway.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
We only need enough universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
into thinking that they're real.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,640
Who needs billions of galaxies?

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
We only need the space our subjects are allowed to explore.

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,160
The vast universe could just be a flat projection and they would have no way to know.

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,440
What about small things like cells or bacteria?

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
We don't really need them.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When you use a microscope, what you see could be instantly created.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,400
Same with atoms.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,520
The chair you're sitting on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
We just need the outermost layer of it.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
It might be empty inside until you decide to break it open.

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
but it might be empty until you open it.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
The minimum requirement for our simulation is only the consciousness of our virtual humans.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,080
Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,760
Okay, so are we being simulated?

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
Well, maybe, but there are a few conditions that need to be met.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,240
Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,720
so please take everything we say with a grain of salt.

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Based on a modified version of the original simulation argument by Nick Bostrom,

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
we have five assumptions for you.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,640
If they're true, you, dear viewer, are living in a simulation.

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
Assumption one.

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
It's possible to simulate consciousness.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,640
Nobody knows what consciousness is.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,240
For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Brains are pretty complex.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,400
If you count every interaction between synapses as one operation,

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,240
your brain runs at about 10 to the power of 17, or 100 million billion operations per second.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's generously assume we need 10 to the power of 20 operations

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,400
to simulate one second of human consciousness.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,880
But we don't want to simulate just one human.

46
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,520
We want to simulate all of human history at once so we can skip around.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Let's say we want to simulate 200 billion humans with an average lifespan of 50 years.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,600
One year has 30 million seconds times 50 years

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,000
times 200 billion humans times 10 to the power of 20 operations.

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,320
So we need a computer able to handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations per second.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,640
More operations than there are stars in the observable universe.

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
A computer like this is just impossible.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
Except maybe it isn't.

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
Assumption two.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,440
Technological progress will not stop anytime soon.

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,840
If we assume that technological progress continues in a similar fashion as it has so far,

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,720
then there might be galaxy-spanning civilizations with unlimited computer power at some point.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,080
Beings on a technology level so advanced that we could barely distinguish them from gods.

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,000
A computer that can handle a million trillion trillion trillion operations is serious business,

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
but there are actually concepts for computers which could handle this.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
The matryoshka brain is a theoretical megastructure

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,480
made up of billions of parts orbiting a star feeding on its radiation.

63
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,280
A computer of this scale would have enough power to simulate many thousands,

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,000
if not millions, of humanities at the same time.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,920
Under technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically,

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,480
so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city or even smaller.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
But only if there's still someone around to build the computer.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
Assumption three.

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,480
Advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves.

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,200
If there is a point at which all civilizations destroy themselves,

71
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
this whole discussion ends here.

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Looking into space, you'd expect a universe filled with millions of alien civilizations,

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,760
but we see nobody.

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,960
The reason for this might be great filters.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,800
Great filters are barriers life has to overcome,

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,280
like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change, or a black hole generator.

77
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,400
If life is inherently self-destructive, then there are no simulations.

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,320
We explain this in more detail in our Fermi Paradox video.

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
Assumption four.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Super advanced civilizations want to run simulations.

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,240
When we speak of post-human civilizations, we don't know what we're dealing with.

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,360
To think we know what beings as powerful as gods want is pretty arrogant.

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
Imagine the smartest ant on earth living next to an amusement park.

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
It's curious about what humans are up to, so you try to explain.

85
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand.

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,480
The concept of roller coasters and standing in lines and holidays and fun

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,120
doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
It's the same with us and a post-human being.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,040
Compared to them, we are ants.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Running simulations for fun or science might be an absurdly stupid idea to them.

91
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
But if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons,

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
and assumptions one to three are true too,

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
then the chances are not zero that you are living inside a simulation.

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Assumption five.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,720
If there are a lot of simulations, you are probably inside a simulation.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,640
If there are simulated civilizations, it's likely that there are a lot of them.

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,760
After all, we assume that post-human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power.

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,040
So if they run simulations, it would be convenient to run millions or even billions of them.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,320
If there are billions of simulated universes,

100
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,640
there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings,

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,120
which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,080
are simulated.

103
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,440
So for every conscious being made of flesh, a billion simulated ones exist.

104
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,480
Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not,

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,240
in this case, the chances of you being one of the 999,999,999 simulated ones are pretty high.

106
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
So what you consider reality might not be real at all.

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
You really might be simulated.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
All of this is based on a lot of assumptions that we can't really test right now,

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
so many scientists disagree with this whole thought experiment.

110
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
So don't burn your house down to test if there will be glitches.

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,280
If you are simulated, not that much changes for you.

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,800
You might be on a small planet speeding through eternal nothingness

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
or a simulation inside a computer.

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,880
Your existence does not become more or less scary and bizarre.

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
All we can hope to do is try to live good lives and have a good time,

116
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,360
and hope that if we actually are simulations in a supercomputer,

117
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
nobody trips over the power cable.

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Oh, oh, oh no.

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,640
I think I just unplugged the simulation.

120
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
But what if that doesn't matter?

121
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
What if we are in one right now?

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
What if you are simulated?

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,480
