00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What if the state covered your cost of living? Would you still go to work?

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Go back to school? Not work at all? What would you do?

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
This concept is called Universal Basic Income, or UBI, and it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
In 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
First trials are ongoing or on their way, and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
How would it work, and what are the key arguments for and against?

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Right now, people can't really agree what Universal Basic Income is or should be.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and cut bureaucracy.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
For this video, we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income, enough money to be above the poverty line.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
In the US, this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
The money would not be taxed, and you could do whatever you wanted with it.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
In this scenario, UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society while still keeping the free market intact.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
But if we hand out free money, will people just spend it on booze and stop working?

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
A 2013 study by the World Bank specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
The clear answer? No, they don't. The opposite is true.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What about laziness?

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
Universal Basic Income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around 1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
On average, people reduced their working hours by less than 10%.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty?

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached, like taking part in courses,

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
applying to a certain number of jobs a month, or accepting any kind of job offer, no matter if it's a good fit or what it pays.

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only serve to make the unemployment statistics seem less bad.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
Often, your time would be much better spent looking for the right job, continuing education, or starting a business.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior.

03:01.000 --> 03:10.000
Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month. In a lot of programs, if you earn a single dollar extra, the whole thing is taken away.

03:10.000 --> 03:21.000
If you take a job that's paying $1,200, you might not only lose your benefits, but because of your taxes and other costs, like transportation, you might end up having less money than before.

03:21.000 --> 03:33.000
So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even shrinking, welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty and rewards passive behavior.

03:33.000 --> 03:42.000
A basic income can never be cut, and therefore getting a job and additional income will always make your financial situation better.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Work is always rewarded. Instead of a ceiling, it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible? What about inflation?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Won't prices just rise, making everything just like it was before?

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Since the money is not being created by magic or printers, it needs to be transferred from somewhere.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones. Hence, no inflation.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Okay, but how do we pay for it?

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse. How well off a country is, what the local values are.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Are things like high taxes or cutting the defense budget politically acceptable or not?

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
How much welfare state is already in place, and is it effective?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Each country has its own individual path to a UBI.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
On the other hand, cutting them could leave many people worse off than before.

04:59.000 --> 05:08.000
If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody, there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries, people are not the same.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
The second way, higher taxes, especially for the very wealthy.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
In the US, for example, there's been a lot of economic growth, but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent.

05:20.000 --> 05:29.000
The wealth gap is rapidly widening, and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But UBI is not necessarily expensive.

05:41.000 --> 05:56.000
According to a recent study, a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US could actually grow the GDP by 12% over 8 years because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
What about the people who do the dirty work?

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos?

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard, boring, and unfulfilling labor?

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions.

06:15.000 --> 06:28.000
A study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy, while every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents.

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
There would still be very rich and poor people, but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
For some, this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges how our society is constructed.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society.

07:01.000 --> 07:11.000
This determines your status and options, but it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about.

07:11.000 --> 07:23.000
In 2016, only 33% of U.S. employees were engaged at work, 16% were actively miserable, and the remaining 51% were only physically present.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Would 67% of people stop working if they could?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
Work gives us something to do. It challenges us. It motivates us to improve. It forces us to engage.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
Many find friends or partners at work. We work for social status, wealth, and our place in the world.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
We're looking for something to do with our lives. And for many people, work gives them meaning.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.000
There are other concerns with UBI. If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
Or populists might promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
And a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to inequality.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Rents, for example. While $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas,

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor becoming even more extreme.

08:32.000 --> 08:40.000
And of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling.

08:41.000 --> 08:49.000
So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
There needs to be a lot more research, more and bigger test runs.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
You help us stay independent and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Thank you so much.
