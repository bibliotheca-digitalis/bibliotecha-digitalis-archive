0	5000	What if the state covered your cost of living? Would you still go to work?
5000	10000	Go back to school? Not work at all? What would you do?
10000	19000	This concept is called Universal Basic Income, or UBI, and it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times.
19000	24000	In 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world.
25000	33000	First trials are ongoing or on their way, and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare.
33000	38000	How would it work, and what are the key arguments for and against?
38000	43000	Right now, people can't really agree what Universal Basic Income is or should be.
43000	47000	Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and cut bureaucracy.
47000	55000	Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional.
55000	62000	For this video, we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income, enough money to be above the poverty line.
62000	67000	In the US, this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year.
67000	72000	The money would not be taxed, and you could do whatever you wanted with it.
73000	80000	In this scenario, UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society while still keeping the free market intact.
80000	87000	But if we hand out free money, will people just spend it on booze and stop working?
87000	97000	A 2013 study by the World Bank specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash.
97000	101000	The clear answer? No, they don't. The opposite is true.
101000	106000	Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume.
106000	111000	The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality.
111000	113000	What about laziness?
113000	123000	Universal Basic Income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around 1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids.
123000	128000	On average, people reduced their working hours by less than 10%.
128000	134000	The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs.
134000	141000	But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty?
141000	148000	Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached, like taking part in courses,
148000	156000	applying to a certain number of jobs a month, or accepting any kind of job offer, no matter if it's a good fit or what it pays.
156000	165000	Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only serve to make the unemployment statistics seem less bad.
165000	173000	Often, your time would be much better spent looking for the right job, continuing education, or starting a business.
173000	180000	Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior.
181000	190000	Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month. In a lot of programs, if you earn a single dollar extra, the whole thing is taken away.
190000	201000	If you take a job that's paying $1,200, you might not only lose your benefits, but because of your taxes and other costs, like transportation, you might end up having less money than before.
201000	213000	So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even shrinking, welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty and rewards passive behavior.
213000	222000	A basic income can never be cut, and therefore getting a job and additional income will always make your financial situation better.
222000	229000	Work is always rewarded. Instead of a ceiling, it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up.
229000	236000	But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible? What about inflation?
236000	241000	Won't prices just rise, making everything just like it was before?
241000	247000	Since the money is not being created by magic or printers, it needs to be transferred from somewhere.
247000	253000	It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones. Hence, no inflation.
254000	257000	Okay, but how do we pay for it?
257000	264000	There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse. How well off a country is, what the local values are.
264000	270000	Are things like high taxes or cutting the defense budget politically acceptable or not?
270000	275000	How much welfare state is already in place, and is it effective?
275000	279000	Each country has its own individual path to a UBI.
279000	286000	The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it.
286000	294000	Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy.
294000	299000	On the other hand, cutting them could leave many people worse off than before.
299000	308000	If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody, there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries, people are not the same.
308000	313000	The second way, higher taxes, especially for the very wealthy.
313000	320000	In the US, for example, there's been a lot of economic growth, but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent.
320000	329000	The wealth gap is rapidly widening, and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace.
329000	337000	There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots.
337000	341000	But UBI is not necessarily expensive.
341000	356000	According to a recent study, a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US could actually grow the GDP by 12% over 8 years because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand.
356000	359000	What about the people who do the dirty work?
359000	364000	Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos?
364000	370000	If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard, boring, and unfulfilling labor?
370000	375000	UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions.
375000	388000	A study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy, while every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents.
388000	398000	There would still be very rich and poor people, but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population.
398000	404000	Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic.
404000	410000	For some, this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence.
410000	417000	If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges how our society is constructed.
417000	421000	By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society.
421000	431000	This determines your status and options, but it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about.
431000	443000	In 2016, only 33% of U.S. employees were engaged at work, 16% were actively miserable, and the remaining 51% were only physically present.
443000	447000	Would 67% of people stop working if they could?
447000	451000	It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore.
451000	458000	Work gives us something to do. It challenges us. It motivates us to improve. It forces us to engage.
458000	465000	Many find friends or partners at work. We work for social status, wealth, and our place in the world.
465000	471000	We're looking for something to do with our lives. And for many people, work gives them meaning.
471000	480000	There are other concerns with UBI. If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage.
480000	486000	Individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude.
486000	491000	Or populists might promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power.
491000	497000	And a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to inequality.
498000	505000	Rents, for example. While $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas,
505000	512000	which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor becoming even more extreme.
512000	520000	And of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling.
521000	529000	So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet.
529000	534000	There needs to be a lot more research, more and bigger test runs.
534000	540000	We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it.
540000	546000	The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty.
546000	554000	It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out.
577000	581000	Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help.
581000	587000	You help us stay independent and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity.
587000	589000	Thank you so much.
