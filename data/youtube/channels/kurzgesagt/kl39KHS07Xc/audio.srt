1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What if the state covered your cost of living? Would you still go to work?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Go back to school? Not work at all? What would you do?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This concept is called Universal Basic Income, or UBI, and it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
First trials are ongoing or on their way, and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How would it work, and what are the key arguments for and against?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right now, people can't really agree what Universal Basic Income is or should be.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and cut bureaucracy.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For this video, we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income, enough money to be above the poverty line.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In the US, this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The money would not be taxed, and you could do whatever you wanted with it.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In this scenario, UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society while still keeping the free market intact.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But if we hand out free money, will people just spend it on booze and stop working?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A 2013 study by the World Bank specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The clear answer? No, they don't. The opposite is true.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What about laziness?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Universal Basic Income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around 1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
On average, people reduced their working hours by less than 10%.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty?

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached, like taking part in courses,

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
applying to a certain number of jobs a month, or accepting any kind of job offer, no matter if it's a good fit or what it pays.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only serve to make the unemployment statistics seem less bad.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Often, your time would be much better spent looking for the right job, continuing education, or starting a business.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month. In a lot of programs, if you earn a single dollar extra, the whole thing is taken away.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you take a job that's paying $1,200, you might not only lose your benefits, but because of your taxes and other costs, like transportation, you might end up having less money than before.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even shrinking, welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty and rewards passive behavior.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A basic income can never be cut, and therefore getting a job and additional income will always make your financial situation better.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Work is always rewarded. Instead of a ceiling, it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible? What about inflation?

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Won't prices just rise, making everything just like it was before?

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Since the money is not being created by magic or printers, it needs to be transferred from somewhere.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones. Hence, no inflation.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, but how do we pay for it?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse. How well off a country is, what the local values are.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are things like high taxes or cutting the defense budget politically acceptable or not?

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How much welfare state is already in place, and is it effective?

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Each country has its own individual path to a UBI.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
On the other hand, cutting them could leave many people worse off than before.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody, there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries, people are not the same.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The second way, higher taxes, especially for the very wealthy.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In the US, for example, there's been a lot of economic growth, but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The wealth gap is rapidly widening, and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots.

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But UBI is not necessarily expensive.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:56,000
According to a recent study, a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US could actually grow the GDP by 12% over 8 years because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What about the people who do the dirty work?

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos?

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard, boring, and unfulfilling labor?

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions.

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy, while every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents.

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There would still be very rich and poor people, but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For some, this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges how our society is constructed.

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society.

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This determines your status and options, but it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about.

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In 2016, only 33% of U.S. employees were engaged at work, 16% were actively miserable, and the remaining 51% were only physically present.

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Would 67% of people stop working if they could?

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore.

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Work gives us something to do. It challenges us. It motivates us to improve. It forces us to engage.

68
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Many find friends or partners at work. We work for social status, wealth, and our place in the world.

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're looking for something to do with our lives. And for many people, work gives them meaning.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are other concerns with UBI. If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude.

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Or populists might promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to inequality.

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Rents, for example. While $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas,

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor becoming even more extreme.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling.

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There needs to be a lot more research, more and bigger test runs.

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it.

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty.

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out.

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help.

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You help us stay independent and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity.

84
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you so much.
