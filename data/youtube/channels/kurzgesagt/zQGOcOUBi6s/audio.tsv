0	3000	Every second of your life, you are under attack.
3000	7000	Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home.
7000	17000	Still, our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators to protect you from, well, dying.
17000	21000	For this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs.
21000	25000	For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc.
25000	29000	And it has 21 different cells and two protein forces.
29000	32000	These cells have up to four different jobs.
32000	33000	Let's assign them.
33000	35000	Here are the interactions.
35000	38000	Now, let's make this understandable.
38000	40000	First of all, let's add colors to the jobs.
40000	43000	Now, let's illustrate the cells.
43000	49000	The central color represents the main job of a cell, while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties.
49000	52000	Now, the immune system looks like this.
52000	54000	Now the interactions.
54000	57000	Isn't this complexity just awesome?
58000	63000	For this video, we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest.
63000	66000	So, what happens in the case of an infection?
72000	78000	It's a beautiful day when suddenly a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself.
78000	82000	The first barrier of the immune system is breached, your skin.
82000	86000	Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound.
86000	91000	They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes.
91000	95000	At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached,
95000	100000	they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them.
100000	104000	The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.
104000	108000	First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene.
108000	112000	They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body.
112000	115000	Most of the time, they alone can suffocate and attack
115000	118000	because they can devour up to 100 intruders each.
118000	122000	They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane.
122000	125000	Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed.
125000	130000	On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield
130000	132000	so fighting becomes easier.
132000	135000	You notice this as a very mild swelling.
135000	138000	When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup
138000	142000	by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency.
142000	147000	Neutrophiles leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield.
147000	151000	The neutrophiles fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process.
151000	155000	On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria.
155000	160000	They are indeed so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days
160000	162000	to prevent them from causing too much damage.
162000	167000	If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in.
167000	169000	The dendritic cell gets active.
169000	173000	It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies.
173000	177000	They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer.
177000	180000	Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision.
180000	184000	Should they call for antivirus forces that eradicate infected body cells
184000	186000	or an army of bacteria killers?
186000	190000	In this case, antibacterial forces are necessary.
190000	193000	It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day.
193000	197000	Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated.
197000	201000	When T cells are born, they go through a difficult and complicated training process
201000	203000	and only a quarter survives.
203000	207000	The surviving cells are equipped with a specific setup.
207000	212000	And the dendritic cell is on its way, looking for a helper T cell with a setup that's just right.
212000	216000	It's looking for a helper T cell that combine to the parts of the intruders
216000	219000	which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane.
219000	222000	When it finally finds one, the chain reaction takes place.
222000	224000	The helper T cell is activated.
224000	227000	It quickly duplicates thousands of times.
227000	230000	Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node
230000	232000	and will make you practically immune against this enemy.
232000	235000	Some travel to the field of battle to help out.
235000	238000	And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node
238000	241000	to activate a very powerful weapons factory.
241000	244000	Like the T cells, they are born with a specific setup.
244000	247000	And when a B cell and a T cell with the same setup meet,
247000	248000	hell breaks loose.
248000	253000	The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons.
253000	257000	They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast.
257000	260000	Here, helper T cells play another important role.
260000	263000	They stimulate the hardworking factories and tell them,
263000	266000	don't die yet, we still need you, keep going.
266000	269000	This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over
269000	272000	so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself.
272000	275000	But what is produced by the B cells?
275000	277000	You've heard of them of course, antibodies.
277000	282000	Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder.
282000	286000	There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs.
286000	291000	The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion.
291000	295000	Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body.
295000	299000	Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire.
299000	303000	The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body.
303000	307000	Guard and attack cells fight hard but also die in the process.
307000	312000	Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer.
312000	315000	But without help, they can't overwhelm the bacteria.
315000	318000	But now the second line of defense arrives.
318000	322000	Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders,
322000	325000	rendering them helpless or killing them in the process.
325000	328000	They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target.
328000	334000	Their back is built to connect to killer cells so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily.
334000	339000	Macrophages are especially good at gnoming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to.
339000	341000	Now, the balance shifts.
341000	344000	In a team effort, the infection is wiped out.
344000	348000	At this point, millions of body cells have already died.
348000	351000	No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished.
351000	355000	Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals,
355000	359000	they commit suicide so as not to waste any resources.
359000	362000	But some stay behind, the memory cells.
362000	365000	If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future,
365000	369000	they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice.
369000	374000	This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work.
374000	376000	Can you imagine how complex this system is?
376000	380000	Even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry.
380000	384000	Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it,
384000	388000	we always encounter endless wonders and great beauty.
