1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Every second of your life, you are under attack.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Still, our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators to protect you from, well, dying.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And it has 21 different cells and two protein forces.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These cells have up to four different jobs.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's assign them.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here are the interactions.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, let's make this understandable.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First of all, let's add colors to the jobs.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, let's illustrate the cells.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The central color represents the main job of a cell, while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, the immune system looks like this.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now the interactions.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Isn't this complexity just awesome?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For this video, we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, what happens in the case of an infection?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a beautiful day when suddenly a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first barrier of the immune system is breached, your skin.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Most of the time, they alone can suffocate and attack

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
because they can devour up to 100 intruders each.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so fighting becomes easier.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You notice this as a very mild swelling.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Neutrophiles leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The neutrophiles fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They are indeed so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to prevent them from causing too much damage.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The dendritic cell gets active.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Should they call for antivirus forces that eradicate infected body cells

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
or an army of bacteria killers?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In this case, antibacterial forces are necessary.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When T cells are born, they go through a difficult and complicated training process

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and only a quarter survives.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The surviving cells are equipped with a specific setup.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And the dendritic cell is on its way, looking for a helper T cell with a setup that's just right.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's looking for a helper T cell that combine to the parts of the intruders

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When it finally finds one, the chain reaction takes place.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The helper T cell is activated.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It quickly duplicates thousands of times.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and will make you practically immune against this enemy.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Some travel to the field of battle to help out.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to activate a very powerful weapons factory.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like the T cells, they are born with a specific setup.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And when a B cell and a T cell with the same setup meet,

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
hell breaks loose.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Here, helper T cells play another important role.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They stimulate the hardworking factories and tell them,

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
don't die yet, we still need you, keep going.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But what is produced by the B cells?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You've heard of them of course, antibodies.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Guard and attack cells fight hard but also die in the process.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But without help, they can't overwhelm the bacteria.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But now the second line of defense arrives.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders,

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
rendering them helpless or killing them in the process.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Their back is built to connect to killer cells so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Macrophages are especially good at gnoming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now, the balance shifts.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In a team effort, the infection is wiped out.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
At this point, millions of body cells have already died.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals,

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
they commit suicide so as not to waste any resources.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But some stay behind, the memory cells.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future,

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can you imagine how complex this system is?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it,

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
we always encounter endless wonders and great beauty.
