00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Every second of your life, you are under attack.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home.

00:07.000 --> 00:17.000
Still, our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators to protect you from, well, dying.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
For this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And it has 21 different cells and two protein forces.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
These cells have up to four different jobs.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Let's assign them.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Here are the interactions.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Now, let's make this understandable.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
First of all, let's add colors to the jobs.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Now, let's illustrate the cells.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
The central color represents the main job of a cell, while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Now, the immune system looks like this.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Now the interactions.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Isn't this complexity just awesome?

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
For this video, we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
So, what happens in the case of an infection?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
It's a beautiful day when suddenly a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
The first barrier of the immune system is breached, your skin.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Most of the time, they alone can suffocate and attack

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
because they can devour up to 100 intruders each.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
so fighting becomes easier.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
You notice this as a very mild swelling.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Neutrophiles leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
The neutrophiles fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
They are indeed so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
to prevent them from causing too much damage.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
The dendritic cell gets active.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Should they call for antivirus forces that eradicate infected body cells

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
or an army of bacteria killers?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
In this case, antibacterial forces are necessary.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
When T cells are born, they go through a difficult and complicated training process

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and only a quarter survives.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
The surviving cells are equipped with a specific setup.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And the dendritic cell is on its way, looking for a helper T cell with a setup that's just right.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
It's looking for a helper T cell that combine to the parts of the intruders

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
When it finally finds one, the chain reaction takes place.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
The helper T cell is activated.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
It quickly duplicates thousands of times.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
and will make you practically immune against this enemy.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Some travel to the field of battle to help out.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
to activate a very powerful weapons factory.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Like the T cells, they are born with a specific setup.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And when a B cell and a T cell with the same setup meet,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
hell breaks loose.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Here, helper T cells play another important role.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
They stimulate the hardworking factories and tell them,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
don't die yet, we still need you, keep going.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
But what is produced by the B cells?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
You've heard of them of course, antibodies.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Guard and attack cells fight hard but also die in the process.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
But without help, they can't overwhelm the bacteria.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
But now the second line of defense arrives.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
rendering them helpless or killing them in the process.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
Their back is built to connect to killer cells so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Macrophages are especially good at gnoming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Now, the balance shifts.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
In a team effort, the infection is wiped out.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
At this point, millions of body cells have already died.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
they commit suicide so as not to waste any resources.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
But some stay behind, the memory cells.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Can you imagine how complex this system is?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it,

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
we always encounter endless wonders and great beauty.
