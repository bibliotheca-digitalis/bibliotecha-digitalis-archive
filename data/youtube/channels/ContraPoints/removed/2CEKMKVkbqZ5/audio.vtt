00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Freedom.

00:01.000 --> 00:03.800
A two-syllable word with a thousand meanings.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
Which matters more?

00:04.800 --> 00:08.680
My freedom to swing my fist, or my freedom to punch you in the face?

00:08.680 --> 00:10.400
Scholars remain divided.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.280
But there's one type of freedom that's the queen of freedom, yay?

00:13.280 --> 00:17.680
The robust, trunk, and turgid root of the great tree of liberty itself, and that is

00:17.680 --> 00:21.000
our most fundamental freedom—the freedom of speech.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.600
Unfortunately, that freedom is now under attack.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.600
By leftists.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.640
I mean, just look at all these hot takes.

00:26.640 --> 00:32.000
The left is killing free speech, the left is silencing free speech, the left turned

00:32.000 --> 00:37.920
against free speech, the left wants to suppress free speech, the left is assaulting free speech,

00:37.920 --> 00:42.600
the left is stifling free speech, the left is silencing free speech.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.160
Leftist terrorists are at war with free speech gooby.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.160
Fuck!

00:46.160 --> 00:47.520
This sounds pretty bad.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.880
Luckily, one hero has emerged to champion freedom once again, and that man is no less

00:51.880 --> 00:53.640
than YouTube's own Dave Rubin.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.000
A man who loves freedom more than life itself.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.720
A man who may disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to

00:59.720 --> 01:03.480
appear on his program and spout racist bullshit without interruption or objection.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.880
A man who's prepared to water the tree of liberty with his own tears.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
Are you tearing up?

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
Check out—you did something!

01:08.880 --> 01:14.040
No, it's, uh, there's a—the lights are getting me, uh...

01:14.040 --> 01:15.360
Was it the lights, Dave?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.480
Are you sure it wasn't...freedom?

01:17.480 --> 01:31.160
So here's the thing, I know and have known a lot of people who are educated, sincere,

01:31.160 --> 01:34.480
and sympathetic to Rubin's point of view, so I think it's worth engaging.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.560
And Dave, he's not a Nazi, so, you know what Dave, pull up a seat, let's talk.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.080
Oh, hold on, I'll make you a drink.

01:47.480 --> 02:01.880
Fire, fire, fire, fire, now you've heard it.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.720
Not shouted in a crowded theater, admittedly, as I realize I seem now to have shouted it

02:07.720 --> 02:10.920
in the Hogwarts dining room.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.520
Ten points to Gryffindor, my friends, ten points indeed.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.000
Jesus, I can already feel myself being infected by Hitchens' pompous oratorical style.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.800
I'm tempted to call him over-fatuous, over-praised Christopher Hitchens.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.040
If I keep that up, I'll be quoting Philip Lorcan at you by the end of the video.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.720
But you know, Dave, it's fitting that I had an acid flashback and hallucinated Christopher

02:28.720 --> 02:33.160
Hitchens just then, because Hitchens is, in a sense, the steel man of your position, the

02:33.160 --> 02:34.920
ultimate champion of free speech.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.120
I mean, he's every liberal white boy's favorite, the man who Bill Maher practically tears up

02:39.120 --> 02:42.520
over while besmirching his memory comparing him to Milo Yiannopoulos.

02:42.520 --> 02:47.560
I mean, you remind me, like, of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
Ugh.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.000
The point is, if I choose Hitchens as the representative of my opponent's position

02:52.000 --> 02:55.440
on free speech, surely no one can accuse me of strawmanning.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.800
So tell me, acid Hitchens, what does free speech mean to you?

02:58.800 --> 03:04.120
So I'll be very daring and summarize all three of these great gentlemen of the great

03:04.120 --> 03:08.440
tradition of especially English liberty in one go.

03:08.440 --> 03:14.120
What they say is, it's not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is

03:14.120 --> 03:18.020
the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear.

03:18.020 --> 03:22.440
And every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action because

03:22.440 --> 03:24.640
you deny yourself the right to hear something.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.480
So free speech isn't just protection against laws regulating expression, it's also the

03:28.480 --> 03:31.760
right of any speaker to a platform, and the right of an audience to hear.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.560
But does that really apply to everyone?

03:33.560 --> 03:35.360
Like what about a holocaust denier?

03:35.360 --> 03:40.600
So that person doesn't just have a right to speak, that person's right to speak must

03:40.600 --> 03:43.920
be given extra protection.

03:43.920 --> 03:51.440
Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with, might contain

03:51.440 --> 03:58.280
a grain of historical truth, might in any case give people to think about why do they

03:58.280 --> 04:00.760
know what they already think they know.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.920
How do I know that I know this except that I've always been taught this and never heard

04:03.920 --> 04:04.920
anything else.

04:04.960 --> 04:09.080
Not only does a holocaust denier have a right to speak, but, in this view, because what

04:09.080 --> 04:13.600
they say is marginal, we actually have a duty to provide special protections to make sure

04:13.600 --> 04:15.440
that what they have to say is heard.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.080
This is a huge, all-inclusive, and very nuanced notion of free speech, and Hitchens isn't

04:20.080 --> 04:21.080
making it up.

04:21.080 --> 04:24.700
It comes from John Stuart Mill, one of history's great social justice warriors.

04:24.700 --> 04:28.020
According to this view, the right to free speech goes way beyond anything guaranteed

04:28.020 --> 04:29.780
by the US Constitution.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.580
It takes into consideration not just legal restrictions, but also the social pressures

04:33.580 --> 04:37.100
that can silence non-conformists in marginal viewpoints in subtle ways.

04:37.100 --> 04:41.180
And you know, Dave, I like that you and Hitchens have this very advanced conception of free

04:41.180 --> 04:42.180
speech.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.900
The idea that we should protect and perhaps even amplify minority viewpoints is one that

04:45.900 --> 04:46.900
I share.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.900
So great.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.100
We actually start from a point of philosophical agreement.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.060
Where we disagree is in the application, the main point of contention being which speakers

04:54.060 --> 04:56.900
are truly marginalized and in need of special protection.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.460
And I think the best way to flesh out that disagreement is to consider the accusations

05:00.460 --> 05:02.220
that the left has it out for free speech.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.060
In my experience, the big pieces of evidence usually brought out against the social justice

05:06.060 --> 05:10.940
warrior left are prohibitions against hate speech, trigger warnings, safe spaces, and

05:10.940 --> 05:11.940
deplatforming.

05:11.940 --> 05:15.780
In this video, I'll cover hate speech, and the rest of it, well, we'll get to that

05:15.780 --> 05:16.780
soon Dave.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.420
We'll get to that real soon.

05:32.220 --> 05:37.600
Objection 1.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.260
Hate speech prohibitions

05:39.260 --> 05:43.860
Unlike the accusations regarding trigger warnings and safe spaces, the suggestion that the prohibition

05:43.860 --> 05:48.260
of hate speech violates the right to free speech is at least not completely frivolous.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.180
I think this is worth taking seriously.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.860
Now free speech prohibitions exist at three levels.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.660
At the highest level, there are legal prohibitions, such as the prohibitions against displaying

05:56.660 --> 06:01.380
Nazi imagery, which have allowed Nazis to get my anti-Nazi videos banned in much of

06:01.620 --> 06:05.580
Speaking as a freedom-loving American, I find these laws clearly in violation of what the

06:05.580 --> 06:06.940
right to free speech protects.

06:06.940 --> 06:10.860
I mean what, the Führer is going to make it illegal to display a swastika now?

06:10.860 --> 06:12.340
What is this, Nazi Germany?

06:14.980 --> 06:18.460
At the middle level, there's institutional prohibitions, such as those that prohibit

06:18.460 --> 06:22.460
hate speech in particular settings, such as universities or the workplace.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.500
These I think are quite a good idea, and I'll explain why in a moment.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.820
At the bottom level, there are social restrictions.

06:27.820 --> 06:32.460
For instance, there's a lot of social pressure in certain communities not to be racist, sexist,

06:32.460 --> 06:33.860
homophobic, and so on.

06:33.860 --> 06:38.060
And although not formal rules, these norms can have a silencing effect, and place a de-facto

06:38.060 --> 06:40.660
limitation on the things people are willing to say.

06:40.660 --> 06:44.740
For instance, conservatives and classical liberals are constantly complaining to me

06:44.740 --> 06:50.260
about how the words transphobe, racist, Islamophobe, and so on are being used to silence them.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.020
And in a sense, they're kind of right.

06:52.020 --> 06:55.260
I mean, people are saying those things to you because they want you to stop saying what

06:55.260 --> 06:56.260
you're saying.

06:56.260 --> 07:00.220
And of course, this is pretty microscopic as far as restrictions on free speech go.

07:00.220 --> 07:05.380
So I guess you might say it's a sort of free speech… microaggression, right?

07:05.380 --> 07:06.380
And that is what it is.

07:06.380 --> 07:10.060
It's a subtle, indirect way of trying to get you not to say a certain thing.

07:10.060 --> 07:15.100
So great, I want to congratulate conservatives on independently discovering the idea of microaggressions.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.980
But if you're willing to grant that words like Islamophobia can have a silencing effect,

07:18.980 --> 07:23.220
you should also be willing to grant that small acts of racism, sexism, homophobia, and so

07:23.220 --> 07:26.620
on can likewise suppress the speech of marginalized people.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.820
For instance, I constantly hear from women, trans, and gender nonconforming people that

07:30.820 --> 07:33.860
they've thought of making YouTube videos, but they just don't want to deal with the

07:33.860 --> 07:38.540
hate, the trolls, the constant misogyny and attacks on gender identity, the public shaming

07:38.540 --> 07:43.220
and genderqueer and feminist cringe compilations, and so they just avoid speaking up on YouTube

07:43.220 --> 07:44.220
altogether.

07:44.220 --> 07:48.660
So in a sense, these people are being silenced by the misogynistic and transphobic atmosphere,

07:48.660 --> 07:52.040
in the same way that your average YouTube shitlord would probably feel pretty alone

07:52.040 --> 07:56.660
and silenced in a gender studies class with 19 women complaining about sexist men.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.960
Now when I bring this up with classical liberals, they uniformly respond,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.620
If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.100
The internet's just like that.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.760
Why can't you just deal with it?

08:05.760 --> 08:10.920
To which I respond, why can't you just deal with being called a racist on college campuses?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.320
Academia's just like that.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.700
And whatever you say to that, there's the answer to your question.

08:17.700 --> 08:21.480
So if you adopt a sophisticated view of free speech, you have to contend with the following

08:21.480 --> 08:23.280
contradictory situation.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.520
There are many instances where you have to choose between suppressing one person's

08:26.520 --> 08:27.520
speech or another's.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.960
The fact is, there is no true neutral when it comes to free speech.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.360
It's literally impossible to protect everyone's speech equally, because some forms of speech

08:35.360 --> 08:37.320
tend to dampen other forms of speech.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.160
So there comes a point where you have to choose whose side you're on.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.560
In this case, do you want to defend the speech of misogynists or the speech of women?

08:44.560 --> 08:46.280
Racists or people of colour?

08:46.280 --> 08:47.920
Homophobes and transphobes or queer people?

08:47.920 --> 08:51.600
And I'm not talking about passing laws here, I'm talking about establishing norms of

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
discourse.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.140
And what I notice about you, Dave, and about much of your audience, is you only ever seem

08:56.140 --> 09:00.520
to stand up for the right of people not to be silenced by slurs like racist and transphobe,

09:00.520 --> 09:04.200
and in fact you present the topic like it's the most important political issue in the

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
world right now.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.400
But on the subject of how bigoted attitudes and speech may silence women, people of colour,

09:09.400 --> 09:13.480
queer people, and other marginalized groups, you seem to have absolutely nothing to say.

09:13.480 --> 09:17.060
There's endless catastrophizing from classical liberals on YouTube and elsewhere about how

09:17.100 --> 09:21.500
policies prohibiting transphobia in the workplace, including intentional misgendering, are a

09:21.500 --> 09:24.380
terrible limitation on the freedom of speech of transphobes.

09:24.380 --> 09:28.460
But these same people give no concern whatsoever to the way in which a hostile environment

09:28.460 --> 09:33.580
where, for instance, a trans employee's gender identity is constantly disparaged and disregarded

09:33.580 --> 09:37.500
might itself have a silencing effect if it doesn't pressure trans people out of the workforce

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
altogether.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.060
And I can't help but look at this and conclude that you've taken a side in an ideological

09:42.060 --> 09:46.300
battle while pretending all the way that you're simply defending the supposedly neutral value

09:46.340 --> 09:47.340
of free speech.

09:47.340 --> 09:50.700
Well don't think we don't notice which instances of speech you choose to defend.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.860
And this doesn't just apply to Dave Rubin either.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.540
Let's see what Hitchens, so passionate in his defense of the Holocaust denier's right

09:56.540 --> 10:00.580
to a platform, has to say about protecting the speech of women, queer people, and people

10:00.580 --> 10:01.580
of colour.

10:01.580 --> 10:06.820
Because we've had invocations of a rather driveling and sickly kind tonight of our sympathy.

10:06.820 --> 10:11.620
What about the poor fags, what about the poor Jews, the wretched women who can't take

10:11.620 --> 10:16.220
the abuse, and the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make it and were

10:16.220 --> 10:17.940
told that their land was forfeit?

10:17.940 --> 10:22.420
So the women, the fags, the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make

10:22.420 --> 10:27.460
it should just take the abuse while the Holocaust denier deserves special protections.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.300
Like I said, don't think we don't notice whose speech you rush to defend, and who you

10:31.300 --> 10:33.460
tell to take the abuse and get over it.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.900
Why does everyone love Hitchens so much?

10:34.900 --> 10:38.500
I mean we've got people in the comments saying they want to memorize his speech and

10:38.500 --> 10:41.420
that they cried during his speech because of freedom.

10:41.420 --> 10:45.100
I mean every American liberal with a weakness for a slick turn of phrase and an oaky public

10:45.140 --> 10:46.540
school accent is susceptible.

10:46.540 --> 10:49.980
I certainly had a boner for the man for years, and part of me still does.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.620
But there's something self-satisfying about it, isn't there?

10:52.620 --> 10:57.380
I, the intellectual kin of Socrates, appreciate the true value of free speech in accordance

10:57.380 --> 11:01.980
with the great English tradition of liberty, unlike these wretched, whiny women blacks

11:01.980 --> 11:03.400
and Muslims.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
Fuck that sh—

11:04.400 --> 11:14.400
Tell me, Lao Shih, what is permitted, and what forbidden?

11:14.400 --> 11:18.800
Ken Kao Fok Di Yuan.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.640
The truth is that there are always explicit or implicit limitations on the kind of speech

11:22.640 --> 11:26.520
that's acceptable, and there are major restrictions that no one complains about, not even Dave

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
Rubin.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.800
For instance, there's a whole lot of stuff that you aren't allowed to say or do in

11:29.800 --> 11:30.960
a YouTube video.

11:30.960 --> 11:34.160
If there weren't, there'd be a whole lot more full penetration on this channel, I

11:34.160 --> 11:35.160
can tell you that.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.800
Just multiple camera angles of me being ruthlessly pegged by a giant woman in a lizard mask.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.440
And sure, maybe that's not what Milton had in mind when he wrote the Areopagitica, but

11:43.440 --> 11:45.360
do you believe in freedom or not, Dave?

11:45.360 --> 11:49.960
And okay, I guess obscenity and hate speech are maybe not equivalent examples, granted,

11:49.960 --> 11:53.640
but even the staunchest defenders of free speech all seem to have instances where they're

11:53.640 --> 11:54.960
willing to make exceptions.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.600
For instance, Hitchens claims at the beginning of his free speech lecture that he's willing

11:58.600 --> 12:01.320
to tolerate any interruption, no matter how abusive.

12:01.320 --> 12:07.640
I exempt myself from the speaker's kind offer of protection that was so generously

12:07.640 --> 12:09.400
proffered at the opening of this evening.

12:09.400 --> 12:14.520
Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me is quite free to do so.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.200
And we've heard his defense of platforming holocaust tonight, but is he willing to give

12:18.200 --> 12:20.000
9-11 truthers the same courtesy?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.480
Let's take a look.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.480
Go away.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
Go away.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.680
We don't want fascist crackpots taking up our meeting, thank you.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
Go away.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.680
Go away.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
Different panel.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
Fascist crackpot.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.680
Fascist crackpot.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.680
We're not here to talk to you.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.680
Throw him out.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.680
Throw him out.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.680
Security.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.680
Security, please.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.980
So he calls them fascist crackpots and has them removed by security, and in the comments

12:47.980 --> 12:50.160
the fanboys are celebrating the own age.

12:50.160 --> 12:54.160
But all he did is deplatform them, which, fair enough, I would do the same, but he's

12:54.160 --> 12:57.720
doing exactly what I say we should do with people like Richard Spencer, and then people

12:57.720 --> 12:59.880
accuse me of being against freedom of speech.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.240
The point is, no one is perfectly consistent when it comes to protecting the speech of

13:03.240 --> 13:07.000
people they disagree with, and in effect, it's impossible to be perfectly consistent

13:07.000 --> 13:11.440
because, as I've argued, some forms of speech tend to suppress other forms of speech.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.280
But I think you could learn a lot about a person's politics, by which speech they

13:14.280 --> 13:17.200
choose to defend, and which speech they choose to shut down.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.740
So when I see people defending Richard Spencer, and acting like the Declaration of Human Rights

13:20.740 --> 13:24.580
has gone up in flames because of campus or workplace hate speech prohibitions, while

13:24.580 --> 13:28.540
saying absolutely nothing about the way hate speech itself can be silencing, I don't

13:28.540 --> 13:30.380
see neutral defenders of free speech.

13:30.380 --> 13:34.040
I see people who have taken a side, and it's not the right side.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.140
As Philip Lorkin once said,

13:36.140 --> 13:52.360
Well, are you going to answer the phone?

13:52.360 --> 14:16.440
Hey yo tien hua, ji-yo mi-yu.

14:16.440 --> 14:21.000
Special thanks to James Rans, who's been very unjustly excluded from the credits until

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
now.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.620
And, for the last time reading the entire roster aloud, at least until the failure sets

14:26.620 --> 14:32.600
in and I have fewer patrons again, a very special thanks indeed to Aaron Ho, Aislinn,

14:32.600 --> 14:38.340
