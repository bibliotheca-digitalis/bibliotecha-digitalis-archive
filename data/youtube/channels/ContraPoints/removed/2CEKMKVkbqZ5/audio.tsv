0	1000	Freedom.
1000	3800	A two-syllable word with a thousand meanings.
3800	4800	Which matters more?
4800	8680	My freedom to swing my fist, or my freedom to punch you in the face?
8680	10400	Scholars remain divided.
10400	13280	But there's one type of freedom that's the queen of freedom, yay?
13280	17680	The robust, trunk, and turgid root of the great tree of liberty itself, and that is
17680	21000	our most fundamental freedom—the freedom of speech.
21000	23600	Unfortunately, that freedom is now under attack.
23600	24600	By leftists.
24600	26640	I mean, just look at all these hot takes.
26640	32000	The left is killing free speech, the left is silencing free speech, the left turned
32000	37920	against free speech, the left wants to suppress free speech, the left is assaulting free speech,
37920	42600	the left is stifling free speech, the left is silencing free speech.
42600	45160	Leftist terrorists are at war with free speech gooby.
45160	46160	Fuck!
46160	47520	This sounds pretty bad.
47520	51880	Luckily, one hero has emerged to champion freedom once again, and that man is no less
51880	53640	than YouTube's own Dave Rubin.
53640	56000	A man who loves freedom more than life itself.
56000	59720	A man who may disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to
59720	63480	appear on his program and spout racist bullshit without interruption or objection.
63480	66880	A man who's prepared to water the tree of liberty with his own tears.
66880	67880	Are you tearing up?
67880	68880	Check out—you did something!
68880	74040	No, it's, uh, there's a—the lights are getting me, uh...
74040	75360	Was it the lights, Dave?
75360	77480	Are you sure it wasn't...freedom?
77480	91160	So here's the thing, I know and have known a lot of people who are educated, sincere,
91160	94480	and sympathetic to Rubin's point of view, so I think it's worth engaging.
94480	98560	And Dave, he's not a Nazi, so, you know what Dave, pull up a seat, let's talk.
98560	100080	Oh, hold on, I'll make you a drink.
107480	121880	Fire, fire, fire, fire, now you've heard it.
121880	127720	Not shouted in a crowded theater, admittedly, as I realize I seem now to have shouted it
127720	130920	in the Hogwarts dining room.
130920	133520	Ten points to Gryffindor, my friends, ten points indeed.
133520	138000	Jesus, I can already feel myself being infected by Hitchens' pompous oratorical style.
138000	141800	I'm tempted to call him over-fatuous, over-praised Christopher Hitchens.
141800	145040	If I keep that up, I'll be quoting Philip Lorcan at you by the end of the video.
145040	148720	But you know, Dave, it's fitting that I had an acid flashback and hallucinated Christopher
148720	153160	Hitchens just then, because Hitchens is, in a sense, the steel man of your position, the
153160	154920	ultimate champion of free speech.
154920	159120	I mean, he's every liberal white boy's favorite, the man who Bill Maher practically tears up
159120	162520	over while besmirching his memory comparing him to Milo Yiannopoulos.
162520	167560	I mean, you remind me, like, of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens.
167560	168560	Ugh.
168560	172000	The point is, if I choose Hitchens as the representative of my opponent's position
172000	175440	on free speech, surely no one can accuse me of strawmanning.
175440	178800	So tell me, acid Hitchens, what does free speech mean to you?
178800	184120	So I'll be very daring and summarize all three of these great gentlemen of the great
184120	188440	tradition of especially English liberty in one go.
188440	194120	What they say is, it's not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is
194120	198020	the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear.
198020	202440	And every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action because
202440	204640	you deny yourself the right to hear something.
204640	208480	So free speech isn't just protection against laws regulating expression, it's also the
208480	211760	right of any speaker to a platform, and the right of an audience to hear.
211760	213560	But does that really apply to everyone?
213560	215360	Like what about a holocaust denier?
215360	220600	So that person doesn't just have a right to speak, that person's right to speak must
220600	223920	be given extra protection.
223920	231440	Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with, might contain
231440	238280	a grain of historical truth, might in any case give people to think about why do they
238280	240760	know what they already think they know.
240760	243920	How do I know that I know this except that I've always been taught this and never heard
243920	244920	anything else.
244960	249080	Not only does a holocaust denier have a right to speak, but, in this view, because what
249080	253600	they say is marginal, we actually have a duty to provide special protections to make sure
253600	255440	that what they have to say is heard.
255440	260080	This is a huge, all-inclusive, and very nuanced notion of free speech, and Hitchens isn't
260080	261080	making it up.
261080	264700	It comes from John Stuart Mill, one of history's great social justice warriors.
264700	268020	According to this view, the right to free speech goes way beyond anything guaranteed
268020	269780	by the US Constitution.
269780	273580	It takes into consideration not just legal restrictions, but also the social pressures
273580	277100	that can silence non-conformists in marginal viewpoints in subtle ways.
277100	281180	And you know, Dave, I like that you and Hitchens have this very advanced conception of free
281180	282180	speech.
282180	285900	The idea that we should protect and perhaps even amplify minority viewpoints is one that
285900	286900	I share.
286900	287900	So great.
287900	290100	We actually start from a point of philosophical agreement.
290100	294060	Where we disagree is in the application, the main point of contention being which speakers
294060	296900	are truly marginalized and in need of special protection.
296900	300460	And I think the best way to flesh out that disagreement is to consider the accusations
300460	302220	that the left has it out for free speech.
302260	306060	In my experience, the big pieces of evidence usually brought out against the social justice
306060	310940	warrior left are prohibitions against hate speech, trigger warnings, safe spaces, and
310940	311940	deplatforming.
311940	315780	In this video, I'll cover hate speech, and the rest of it, well, we'll get to that
315780	316780	soon Dave.
316780	318420	We'll get to that real soon.
332220	337600	Objection 1.
337600	339260	Hate speech prohibitions
339260	343860	Unlike the accusations regarding trigger warnings and safe spaces, the suggestion that the prohibition
343860	348260	of hate speech violates the right to free speech is at least not completely frivolous.
348260	350180	I think this is worth taking seriously.
350180	352860	Now free speech prohibitions exist at three levels.
352860	356660	At the highest level, there are legal prohibitions, such as the prohibitions against displaying
356660	361380	Nazi imagery, which have allowed Nazis to get my anti-Nazi videos banned in much of
361620	365580	Speaking as a freedom-loving American, I find these laws clearly in violation of what the
365580	366940	right to free speech protects.
366940	370860	I mean what, the Führer is going to make it illegal to display a swastika now?
370860	372340	What is this, Nazi Germany?
374980	378460	At the middle level, there's institutional prohibitions, such as those that prohibit
378460	382460	hate speech in particular settings, such as universities or the workplace.
382460	385500	These I think are quite a good idea, and I'll explain why in a moment.
385500	387820	At the bottom level, there are social restrictions.
387820	392460	For instance, there's a lot of social pressure in certain communities not to be racist, sexist,
392460	393860	homophobic, and so on.
393860	398060	And although not formal rules, these norms can have a silencing effect, and place a de-facto
398060	400660	limitation on the things people are willing to say.
400660	404740	For instance, conservatives and classical liberals are constantly complaining to me
404740	410260	about how the words transphobe, racist, Islamophobe, and so on are being used to silence them.
410260	412020	And in a sense, they're kind of right.
412020	415260	I mean, people are saying those things to you because they want you to stop saying what
415260	416260	you're saying.
416260	420220	And of course, this is pretty microscopic as far as restrictions on free speech go.
420220	425380	So I guess you might say it's a sort of free speech… microaggression, right?
425380	426380	And that is what it is.
426380	430060	It's a subtle, indirect way of trying to get you not to say a certain thing.
430060	435100	So great, I want to congratulate conservatives on independently discovering the idea of microaggressions.
435100	438980	But if you're willing to grant that words like Islamophobia can have a silencing effect,
438980	443220	you should also be willing to grant that small acts of racism, sexism, homophobia, and so
443220	446620	on can likewise suppress the speech of marginalized people.
446620	450820	For instance, I constantly hear from women, trans, and gender nonconforming people that
450820	453860	they've thought of making YouTube videos, but they just don't want to deal with the
453860	458540	hate, the trolls, the constant misogyny and attacks on gender identity, the public shaming
458540	463220	and genderqueer and feminist cringe compilations, and so they just avoid speaking up on YouTube
463220	464220	altogether.
464220	468660	So in a sense, these people are being silenced by the misogynistic and transphobic atmosphere,
468660	472040	in the same way that your average YouTube shitlord would probably feel pretty alone
472040	476660	and silenced in a gender studies class with 19 women complaining about sexist men.
476660	479960	Now when I bring this up with classical liberals, they uniformly respond,
479960	482620	If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
482620	484100	The internet's just like that.
484100	485760	Why can't you just deal with it?
485760	490920	To which I respond, why can't you just deal with being called a racist on college campuses?
490920	492320	Academia's just like that.
492320	497700	And whatever you say to that, there's the answer to your question.
497700	501480	So if you adopt a sophisticated view of free speech, you have to contend with the following
501480	503280	contradictory situation.
503280	506520	There are many instances where you have to choose between suppressing one person's
506520	507520	speech or another's.
507520	510960	The fact is, there is no true neutral when it comes to free speech.
510960	515360	It's literally impossible to protect everyone's speech equally, because some forms of speech
515360	517320	tend to dampen other forms of speech.
517320	520160	So there comes a point where you have to choose whose side you're on.
520160	524560	In this case, do you want to defend the speech of misogynists or the speech of women?
524560	526280	Racists or people of colour?
526280	527920	Homophobes and transphobes or queer people?
527920	531600	And I'm not talking about passing laws here, I'm talking about establishing norms of
531600	532600	discourse.
532600	536140	And what I notice about you, Dave, and about much of your audience, is you only ever seem
536140	540520	to stand up for the right of people not to be silenced by slurs like racist and transphobe,
540520	544200	and in fact you present the topic like it's the most important political issue in the
544200	545200	world right now.
545200	549400	But on the subject of how bigoted attitudes and speech may silence women, people of colour,
549400	553480	queer people, and other marginalized groups, you seem to have absolutely nothing to say.
553480	557060	There's endless catastrophizing from classical liberals on YouTube and elsewhere about how
557100	561500	policies prohibiting transphobia in the workplace, including intentional misgendering, are a
561500	564380	terrible limitation on the freedom of speech of transphobes.
564380	568460	But these same people give no concern whatsoever to the way in which a hostile environment
568460	573580	where, for instance, a trans employee's gender identity is constantly disparaged and disregarded
573580	577500	might itself have a silencing effect if it doesn't pressure trans people out of the workforce
577500	578500	altogether.
578500	582060	And I can't help but look at this and conclude that you've taken a side in an ideological
582060	586300	battle while pretending all the way that you're simply defending the supposedly neutral value
586340	587340	of free speech.
587340	590700	Well don't think we don't notice which instances of speech you choose to defend.
590700	592860	And this doesn't just apply to Dave Rubin either.
592860	596540	Let's see what Hitchens, so passionate in his defense of the Holocaust denier's right
596540	600580	to a platform, has to say about protecting the speech of women, queer people, and people
600580	601580	of colour.
601580	606820	Because we've had invocations of a rather driveling and sickly kind tonight of our sympathy.
606820	611620	What about the poor fags, what about the poor Jews, the wretched women who can't take
611620	616220	the abuse, and the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make it and were
616220	617940	told that their land was forfeit?
617940	622420	So the women, the fags, the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make
622420	627460	it should just take the abuse while the Holocaust denier deserves special protections.
627460	631300	Like I said, don't think we don't notice whose speech you rush to defend, and who you
631300	633460	tell to take the abuse and get over it.
633460	634900	Why does everyone love Hitchens so much?
634900	638500	I mean we've got people in the comments saying they want to memorize his speech and
638500	641420	that they cried during his speech because of freedom.
641420	645100	I mean every American liberal with a weakness for a slick turn of phrase and an oaky public
645140	646540	school accent is susceptible.
646540	649980	I certainly had a boner for the man for years, and part of me still does.
649980	652620	But there's something self-satisfying about it, isn't there?
652620	657380	I, the intellectual kin of Socrates, appreciate the true value of free speech in accordance
657380	661980	with the great English tradition of liberty, unlike these wretched, whiny women blacks
661980	663400	and Muslims.
663400	664400	Fuck that sh—
664400	674400	Tell me, Lao Shih, what is permitted, and what forbidden?
674400	678800	Ken Kao Fok Di Yuan.
678800	682640	The truth is that there are always explicit or implicit limitations on the kind of speech
682640	686520	that's acceptable, and there are major restrictions that no one complains about, not even Dave
686520	687520	Rubin.
687520	689800	For instance, there's a whole lot of stuff that you aren't allowed to say or do in
689800	690960	a YouTube video.
690960	694160	If there weren't, there'd be a whole lot more full penetration on this channel, I
694160	695160	can tell you that.
695160	699800	Just multiple camera angles of me being ruthlessly pegged by a giant woman in a lizard mask.
699800	703440	And sure, maybe that's not what Milton had in mind when he wrote the Areopagitica, but
703440	705360	do you believe in freedom or not, Dave?
705360	709960	And okay, I guess obscenity and hate speech are maybe not equivalent examples, granted,
709960	713640	but even the staunchest defenders of free speech all seem to have instances where they're
713640	714960	willing to make exceptions.
714960	718600	For instance, Hitchens claims at the beginning of his free speech lecture that he's willing
718600	721320	to tolerate any interruption, no matter how abusive.
721320	727640	I exempt myself from the speaker's kind offer of protection that was so generously
727640	729400	proffered at the opening of this evening.
729400	734520	Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me is quite free to do so.
734520	738200	And we've heard his defense of platforming holocaust tonight, but is he willing to give
738200	740000	9-11 truthers the same courtesy?
740000	741480	Let's take a look.
741480	742480	Go away.
742480	743480	Go away.
743480	746680	We don't want fascist crackpots taking up our meeting, thank you.
746680	747680	Go away.
747680	748680	Go away.
748680	749680	Different panel.
749680	750680	Fascist crackpot.
751680	752680	Fascist crackpot.
752680	755680	We're not here to talk to you.
755680	757680	Throw him out.
757680	759680	Throw him out.
759680	761680	Security.
761680	763680	Security, please.
763680	767980	So he calls them fascist crackpots and has them removed by security, and in the comments
767980	770160	the fanboys are celebrating the own age.
770160	774160	But all he did is deplatform them, which, fair enough, I would do the same, but he's
774160	777720	doing exactly what I say we should do with people like Richard Spencer, and then people
777720	779880	accuse me of being against freedom of speech.
779880	783240	The point is, no one is perfectly consistent when it comes to protecting the speech of
783240	787000	people they disagree with, and in effect, it's impossible to be perfectly consistent
787000	791440	because, as I've argued, some forms of speech tend to suppress other forms of speech.
791440	794280	But I think you could learn a lot about a person's politics, by which speech they
794280	797200	choose to defend, and which speech they choose to shut down.
797200	800740	So when I see people defending Richard Spencer, and acting like the Declaration of Human Rights
800740	804580	has gone up in flames because of campus or workplace hate speech prohibitions, while
804580	808540	saying absolutely nothing about the way hate speech itself can be silencing, I don't
808540	810380	see neutral defenders of free speech.
810380	814040	I see people who have taken a side, and it's not the right side.
814040	816140	As Philip Lorkin once said,
816140	832360	Well, are you going to answer the phone?
832360	856440	Hey yo tien hua, ji-yo mi-yu.
