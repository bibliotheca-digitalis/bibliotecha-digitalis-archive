1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Freedom.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,800
A two-syllable word with a thousand meanings.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Which matters more?

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,680
My freedom to swing my fist, or my freedom to punch you in the face?

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,400
Scholars remain divided.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
But there's one type of freedom that's the queen of freedom, yay?

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
The robust, trunk, and turgid root of the great tree of liberty itself, and that is

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,000
our most fundamental freedom—the freedom of speech.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,600
Unfortunately, that freedom is now under attack.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
By leftists.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,640
I mean, just look at all these hot takes.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,000
The left is killing free speech, the left is silencing free speech, the left turned

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,920
against free speech, the left wants to suppress free speech, the left is assaulting free speech,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,600
the left is stifling free speech, the left is silencing free speech.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,160
Leftist terrorists are at war with free speech gooby.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Fuck!

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
This sounds pretty bad.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,880
Luckily, one hero has emerged to champion freedom once again, and that man is no less

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
than YouTube's own Dave Rubin.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,000
A man who loves freedom more than life itself.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,720
A man who may disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,480
appear on his program and spout racist bullshit without interruption or objection.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,880
A man who's prepared to water the tree of liberty with his own tears.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Are you tearing up?

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Check out—you did something!

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,040
No, it's, uh, there's a—the lights are getting me, uh...

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
Was it the lights, Dave?

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,480
Are you sure it wasn't...freedom?

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:31,160
So here's the thing, I know and have known a lot of people who are educated, sincere,

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,480
and sympathetic to Rubin's point of view, so I think it's worth engaging.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,560
And Dave, he's not a Nazi, so, you know what Dave, pull up a seat, let's talk.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh, hold on, I'll make you a drink.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:02:01,880
Fire, fire, fire, fire, now you've heard it.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Not shouted in a crowded theater, admittedly, as I realize I seem now to have shouted it

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,920
in the Hogwarts dining room.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,520
Ten points to Gryffindor, my friends, ten points indeed.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Jesus, I can already feel myself being infected by Hitchens' pompous oratorical style.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm tempted to call him over-fatuous, over-praised Christopher Hitchens.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,040
If I keep that up, I'll be quoting Philip Lorcan at you by the end of the video.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
But you know, Dave, it's fitting that I had an acid flashback and hallucinated Christopher

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,160
Hitchens just then, because Hitchens is, in a sense, the steel man of your position, the

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,920
ultimate champion of free speech.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,120
I mean, he's every liberal white boy's favorite, the man who Bill Maher practically tears up

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,520
over while besmirching his memory comparing him to Milo Yiannopoulos.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,560
I mean, you remind me, like, of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens.

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Ugh.

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
The point is, if I choose Hitchens as the representative of my opponent's position

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
on free speech, surely no one can accuse me of strawmanning.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
So tell me, acid Hitchens, what does free speech mean to you?

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,120
So I'll be very daring and summarize all three of these great gentlemen of the great

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,440
tradition of especially English liberty in one go.

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,120
What they say is, it's not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,020
the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear.

54
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,440
And every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action because

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,640
you deny yourself the right to hear something.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
So free speech isn't just protection against laws regulating expression, it's also the

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
right of any speaker to a platform, and the right of an audience to hear.

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,560
But does that really apply to everyone?

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Like what about a holocaust denier?

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,600
So that person doesn't just have a right to speak, that person's right to speak must

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,920
be given extra protection.

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,440
Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with, might contain

63
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,280
a grain of historical truth, might in any case give people to think about why do they

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,760
know what they already think they know.

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,920
How do I know that I know this except that I've always been taught this and never heard

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
anything else.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,080
Not only does a holocaust denier have a right to speak, but, in this view, because what

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,600
they say is marginal, we actually have a duty to provide special protections to make sure

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
that what they have to say is heard.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,080
This is a huge, all-inclusive, and very nuanced notion of free speech, and Hitchens isn't

71
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
making it up.

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,700
It comes from John Stuart Mill, one of history's great social justice warriors.

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,020
According to this view, the right to free speech goes way beyond anything guaranteed

74
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,780
by the US Constitution.

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,580
It takes into consideration not just legal restrictions, but also the social pressures

76
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,100
that can silence non-conformists in marginal viewpoints in subtle ways.

77
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,180
And you know, Dave, I like that you and Hitchens have this very advanced conception of free

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,180
speech.

79
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,900
The idea that we should protect and perhaps even amplify minority viewpoints is one that

80
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,900
I share.

81
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
So great.

82
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
We actually start from a point of philosophical agreement.

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,060
Where we disagree is in the application, the main point of contention being which speakers

84
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,900
are truly marginalized and in need of special protection.

85
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,460
And I think the best way to flesh out that disagreement is to consider the accusations

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,220
that the left has it out for free speech.

87
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,060
In my experience, the big pieces of evidence usually brought out against the social justice

88
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,940
warrior left are prohibitions against hate speech, trigger warnings, safe spaces, and

89
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
deplatforming.

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,780
In this video, I'll cover hate speech, and the rest of it, well, we'll get to that

91
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
soon Dave.

92
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,420
We'll get to that real soon.

93
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,600
Objection 1.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,260
Hate speech prohibitions

95
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,860
Unlike the accusations regarding trigger warnings and safe spaces, the suggestion that the prohibition

96
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,260
of hate speech violates the right to free speech is at least not completely frivolous.

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,180
I think this is worth taking seriously.

98
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,860
Now free speech prohibitions exist at three levels.

99
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,660
At the highest level, there are legal prohibitions, such as the prohibitions against displaying

100
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,380
Nazi imagery, which have allowed Nazis to get my anti-Nazi videos banned in much of

101
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,580
Speaking as a freedom-loving American, I find these laws clearly in violation of what the

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,940
right to free speech protects.

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,860
I mean what, the Führer is going to make it illegal to display a swastika now?

104
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,340
What is this, Nazi Germany?

105
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,460
At the middle level, there's institutional prohibitions, such as those that prohibit

106
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
hate speech in particular settings, such as universities or the workplace.

107
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,500
These I think are quite a good idea, and I'll explain why in a moment.

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,820
At the bottom level, there are social restrictions.

109
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,460
For instance, there's a lot of social pressure in certain communities not to be racist, sexist,

110
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,860
homophobic, and so on.

111
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,060
And although not formal rules, these norms can have a silencing effect, and place a de-facto

112
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,660
limitation on the things people are willing to say.

113
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,740
For instance, conservatives and classical liberals are constantly complaining to me

114
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,260
about how the words transphobe, racist, Islamophobe, and so on are being used to silence them.

115
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,020
And in a sense, they're kind of right.

116
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,260
I mean, people are saying those things to you because they want you to stop saying what

117
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
you're saying.

118
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,220
And of course, this is pretty microscopic as far as restrictions on free speech go.

119
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,380
So I guess you might say it's a sort of free speech… microaggression, right?

120
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,380
And that is what it is.

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,060
It's a subtle, indirect way of trying to get you not to say a certain thing.

122
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,100
So great, I want to congratulate conservatives on independently discovering the idea of microaggressions.

123
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,980
But if you're willing to grant that words like Islamophobia can have a silencing effect,

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,220
you should also be willing to grant that small acts of racism, sexism, homophobia, and so

125
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,620
on can likewise suppress the speech of marginalized people.

126
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,820
For instance, I constantly hear from women, trans, and gender nonconforming people that

127
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,860
they've thought of making YouTube videos, but they just don't want to deal with the

128
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,540
hate, the trolls, the constant misogyny and attacks on gender identity, the public shaming

129
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,220
and genderqueer and feminist cringe compilations, and so they just avoid speaking up on YouTube

130
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
altogether.

131
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,660
So in a sense, these people are being silenced by the misogynistic and transphobic atmosphere,

132
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,040
in the same way that your average YouTube shitlord would probably feel pretty alone

133
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,660
and silenced in a gender studies class with 19 women complaining about sexist men.

134
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,960
Now when I bring this up with classical liberals, they uniformly respond,

135
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,620
If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

136
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,100
The internet's just like that.

137
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,760
Why can't you just deal with it?

138
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,920
To which I respond, why can't you just deal with being called a racist on college campuses?

139
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Academia's just like that.

140
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,700
And whatever you say to that, there's the answer to your question.

141
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,480
So if you adopt a sophisticated view of free speech, you have to contend with the following

142
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,280
contradictory situation.

143
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,520
There are many instances where you have to choose between suppressing one person's

144
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
speech or another's.

145
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,960
The fact is, there is no true neutral when it comes to free speech.

146
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,360
It's literally impossible to protect everyone's speech equally, because some forms of speech

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,320
tend to dampen other forms of speech.

148
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,160
So there comes a point where you have to choose whose side you're on.

149
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,560
In this case, do you want to defend the speech of misogynists or the speech of women?

150
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,280
Racists or people of colour?

151
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,920
Homophobes and transphobes or queer people?

152
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,600
And I'm not talking about passing laws here, I'm talking about establishing norms of

153
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
discourse.

154
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,140
And what I notice about you, Dave, and about much of your audience, is you only ever seem

155
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,520
to stand up for the right of people not to be silenced by slurs like racist and transphobe,

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,200
and in fact you present the topic like it's the most important political issue in the

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
world right now.

158
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,400
But on the subject of how bigoted attitudes and speech may silence women, people of colour,

159
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,480
queer people, and other marginalized groups, you seem to have absolutely nothing to say.

160
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,060
There's endless catastrophizing from classical liberals on YouTube and elsewhere about how

161
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,500
policies prohibiting transphobia in the workplace, including intentional misgendering, are a

162
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,380
terrible limitation on the freedom of speech of transphobes.

163
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,460
But these same people give no concern whatsoever to the way in which a hostile environment

164
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,580
where, for instance, a trans employee's gender identity is constantly disparaged and disregarded

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,500
might itself have a silencing effect if it doesn't pressure trans people out of the workforce

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
altogether.

167
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,060
And I can't help but look at this and conclude that you've taken a side in an ideological

168
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,300
battle while pretending all the way that you're simply defending the supposedly neutral value

169
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
of free speech.

170
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,700
Well don't think we don't notice which instances of speech you choose to defend.

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,860
And this doesn't just apply to Dave Rubin either.

172
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,540
Let's see what Hitchens, so passionate in his defense of the Holocaust denier's right

173
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,580
to a platform, has to say about protecting the speech of women, queer people, and people

174
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,580
of colour.

175
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,820
Because we've had invocations of a rather driveling and sickly kind tonight of our sympathy.

176
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,620
What about the poor fags, what about the poor Jews, the wretched women who can't take

177
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,220
the abuse, and the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make it and were

178
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,940
told that their land was forfeit?

179
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,420
So the women, the fags, the slaves and their descendants, and the tribes who didn't make

180
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,460
it should just take the abuse while the Holocaust denier deserves special protections.

181
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,300
Like I said, don't think we don't notice whose speech you rush to defend, and who you

182
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,460
tell to take the abuse and get over it.

183
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,900
Why does everyone love Hitchens so much?

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,500
I mean we've got people in the comments saying they want to memorize his speech and

185
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,420
that they cried during his speech because of freedom.

186
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,100
I mean every American liberal with a weakness for a slick turn of phrase and an oaky public

187
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,540
school accent is susceptible.

188
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,980
I certainly had a boner for the man for years, and part of me still does.

189
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,620
But there's something self-satisfying about it, isn't there?

190
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,380
I, the intellectual kin of Socrates, appreciate the true value of free speech in accordance

191
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,980
with the great English tradition of liberty, unlike these wretched, whiny women blacks

192
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,400
and Muslims.

193
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Fuck that sh—

194
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Tell me, Lao Shih, what is permitted, and what forbidden?

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Ken Kao Fok Di Yuan.

196
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,640
The truth is that there are always explicit or implicit limitations on the kind of speech

197
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,520
that's acceptable, and there are major restrictions that no one complains about, not even Dave

198
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Rubin.

199
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,800
For instance, there's a whole lot of stuff that you aren't allowed to say or do in

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
a YouTube video.

201
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,160
If there weren't, there'd be a whole lot more full penetration on this channel, I

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
can tell you that.

203
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,800
Just multiple camera angles of me being ruthlessly pegged by a giant woman in a lizard mask.

204
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,440
And sure, maybe that's not what Milton had in mind when he wrote the Areopagitica, but

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
do you believe in freedom or not, Dave?

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,960
And okay, I guess obscenity and hate speech are maybe not equivalent examples, granted,

207
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,640
but even the staunchest defenders of free speech all seem to have instances where they're

208
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,960
willing to make exceptions.

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,600
For instance, Hitchens claims at the beginning of his free speech lecture that he's willing

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,320
to tolerate any interruption, no matter how abusive.

211
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,640
I exempt myself from the speaker's kind offer of protection that was so generously

212
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
proffered at the opening of this evening.

213
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me is quite free to do so.

214
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,200
And we've heard his defense of platforming holocaust tonight, but is he willing to give

215
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
9-11 truthers the same courtesy?

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
Let's take a look.

217
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Go away.

218
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Go away.

219
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,680
We don't want fascist crackpots taking up our meeting, thank you.

220
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Go away.

221
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Go away.

222
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Different panel.

223
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Fascist crackpot.

224
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Fascist crackpot.

225
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,680
We're not here to talk to you.

226
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Throw him out.

227
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Throw him out.

228
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Security.

229
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Security, please.

230
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,980
So he calls them fascist crackpots and has them removed by security, and in the comments

231
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,160
the fanboys are celebrating the own age.

232
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
But all he did is deplatform them, which, fair enough, I would do the same, but he's

233
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,720
doing exactly what I say we should do with people like Richard Spencer, and then people

234
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,880
accuse me of being against freedom of speech.

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,240
The point is, no one is perfectly consistent when it comes to protecting the speech of

236
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,000
people they disagree with, and in effect, it's impossible to be perfectly consistent

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,440
because, as I've argued, some forms of speech tend to suppress other forms of speech.

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,280
But I think you could learn a lot about a person's politics, by which speech they

239
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,200
choose to defend, and which speech they choose to shut down.

240
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,740
So when I see people defending Richard Spencer, and acting like the Declaration of Human Rights

241
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,580
has gone up in flames because of campus or workplace hate speech prohibitions, while

242
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,540
saying absolutely nothing about the way hate speech itself can be silencing, I don't

243
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,380
see neutral defenders of free speech.

244
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,040
I see people who have taken a side, and it's not the right side.

245
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,140
As Philip Lorkin once said,

246
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:52,360
Well, are you going to answer the phone?

247
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Hey yo tien hua, ji-yo mi-yu.

248
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Special thanks to James Rans, who's been very unjustly excluded from the credits until

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
now.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,620
And, for the last time reading the entire roster aloud, at least until the failure sets

251
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,600
in and I have fewer patrons again, a very special thanks indeed to Aaron Ho, Aislinn,
