Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, where every question is eternal. Should

00:14.540 --> 00:21.120
women be allowed to vote? Can Black people do science? Is a cabal of Jewish elites colluding

00:21.120 --> 00:28.980
with the Trilateral Commission to turn Atlantis gay? I guess we'll never know. The important

00:29.020 --> 00:38.100
thing is that we never stop debating. Do vaccines cause feminism? Where do gay people come from?

00:38.100 --> 00:48.940
What's really inside the moon? Fossils, are they real? Why is there no White History Month? What

00:48.940 --> 00:57.180
if dreams are the real reality? Tonight we'll be debating the question, are trans women women? My

00:57.220 --> 01:03.020
first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, host of the popular YouTube series Trans Tips with Tiffany.

01:03.020 --> 01:09.460
Clarence, could we roll a clip? Hi fam, welcome to Trans Tips with Tiffany with new feminization

01:09.460 --> 01:14.660
secrets every week to help you unlock your inner woman. This week I'll be demonstrating how women

01:14.660 --> 01:20.140
eat barbecued ribs. So you have your rack of ribs and what men usually do is they just take a rib

01:20.140 --> 01:25.500
and they just kind of dig in. Now some guys like it if you do that. They like a girl who's a little

01:25.500 --> 01:53.900
bit messy but if you want to appear more feminine what you should do is just... Fuck. Wow, truly

01:53.900 --> 02:00.300
inspiring. My other guest tonight is Abigail Cockbane, feminist activist and author of The

02:00.300 --> 02:07.220
Trans Menace, Lesbian Genocide and the Rape of Feminism. So tell me Abigail, are trans women

02:07.220 --> 02:12.940
really women? If by trans women you mean men who put on lipstick and invade women's spaces then no,

02:12.940 --> 02:18.820
men are not women. Okay and Tiffany what do you say to that? Um do I really have to respond to

02:18.820 --> 02:25.380
that? Well yes, yes you do. You're here to debate aren't you? The debate must commence Tiffany. The

02:25.380 --> 02:31.580
debate must commence. Well I am a woman. I live my life as a woman. I wake up as a woman. I make love

02:31.580 --> 02:37.900
as a woman. I experience misogyny like a woman. No no no no no no. Females are oppressed under

02:37.900 --> 02:43.460
patriarchy because men want to control our wombs. Men impersonating women do not have wombs and they

02:43.460 --> 02:47.940
cannot be oppressed on that basis. Well what about infertile cis women? Men don't want to control

02:48.100 --> 02:52.740
their wombs but they still experience sexism don't they? Yes because being female means you're

02:52.740 --> 02:57.500
assumed to have female reproductive function. Men do not try to control the reproductive function

02:57.500 --> 03:02.700
of other men pretending to be women. I am not a man pretending to be a woman. When men cat-call

03:02.700 --> 03:07.660
trans women, when they rape us, when they harass us, when they deny us employment, they don't care

03:07.660 --> 03:11.700
that we don't have a womb. They only care that we're women. Well does any of that even happen?

03:11.700 --> 03:17.300
I for one can always tell the difference between a real woman and a man in a wig and I'm pretty sure

03:17.340 --> 03:21.980
so can men. Well you would know that it happens all the time if you were willing to listen to the

03:21.980 --> 03:29.380
experiences of trans women but you're not willing to do that because you are a TERF. What did you

03:29.380 --> 03:36.220
just call me? Yeah what does that mean? A TERF, a trans exclusionary radical feminist. That is a

03:36.220 --> 03:41.820
vicious anti-female slur. You know it's really not. It's just a fact that that's what you are.

03:41.820 --> 03:46.260
If anything it's too generous because there's nothing radical or feminist about your view.

03:46.260 --> 03:54.460
What? You're a bad feminist. What did you say? Yeah this is a hot exchange of ideas. Keep it

03:54.460 --> 03:59.500
going girls. You're a bad feminist. This is just reactionary gender essentialism with a radical

03:59.500 --> 04:05.300
veneer. How dare you say that? I'll teach you a thing or two about gender essentialism. Gender

04:05.300 --> 04:09.900
essentialism is the idea that wearing high heels and a miniskirt makes you a woman. I never wear

04:09.900 --> 04:15.140
high heels or miniskirts. Why do you think trans women do this? Well Caitlyn Jenner. Not all trans

04:15.140 --> 04:19.980
women are Caitlyn Jenner. A lot of trans women are very feminine because we have to be in order

04:19.980 --> 04:25.100
for society to recognize us as women. But long hair and makeup is not what makes us women. This

04:25.100 --> 04:30.100
is just one way of communicating a truth that comes from within. Right so any hairy man who

04:30.100 --> 04:35.100
decides he feels like a woman one day can just strut around naked in a women's locker room with

04:35.100 --> 04:40.340
his genitals flopping around and women who have been abused by men are expected to just allow that

04:40.380 --> 04:45.740
in their safe space. Why is it always hairy and flopping genitals? Trans women as a group are the

04:45.740 --> 04:50.380
most devoted body hair removers I've ever met and they're also some of the least likely to want to

04:50.380 --> 04:55.140
flop their genitals in public. That doesn't matter. To a woman who has been abused the sight of male

04:55.140 --> 04:59.820
genitals is still triggering. Wouldn't a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of flopping? I

04:59.820 --> 05:04.900
don't know but that's not the point. Trans women are not hairy men who decide to wave their genitals

05:04.900 --> 05:09.540
at women. This is just some scenario you've made up in order to scare people into thinking trans

05:09.540 --> 05:14.500
women are really just predatory men. I'm not making it up. It happens all the time. I can send

05:14.500 --> 05:19.060
you at least a dozen Daily Mail articles about it. Oh the Daily Mail that radical feminist

05:19.060 --> 05:24.180
publication we all love so much. I'm sorry can I interrupt here? It seems like the disagreement in

05:24.180 --> 05:28.900
this exchange is about what it means to be a woman. Abigail it seems like the idea you're

05:28.900 --> 05:34.260
bringing to the marketplace is that women are people with vaginas and Tiffany you're trying

05:34.260 --> 05:39.260
to sell us on the idea that a woman is someone who fills the social role of a woman is that right?

05:39.500 --> 05:44.780
Well not exactly. You can reject conventional social roles while still being a woman. That's

05:44.780 --> 05:49.500
why I emphasize psychology. What matters is that you feel at ease with female embodiment

05:49.500 --> 05:53.660
and ill at ease with male embodiment. Well I'm not at ease with female embodiment. Well would

05:53.660 --> 05:59.740
you rather be in a man's body? Ew. No. The problem isn't my body and I'm not gonna mutilate my body

05:59.740 --> 06:04.220
because I'm not delusional like you. The problem is the gendered assumptions that society projects

06:04.220 --> 06:09.580
onto female bodies. If we abolish gender we'll also abolish gender dysphoria. But gender

06:09.580 --> 06:15.100
dysphoria isn't just dissatisfaction with gender dissociations. I don't like my body being viewed

06:15.100 --> 06:19.340
as a passive object any more than you do but that doesn't mean that I'm not dysphoric about

06:19.340 --> 06:24.220
my male characteristics or that I don't prefer inhabiting a female body. But this preference

06:24.220 --> 06:30.060
for a female body is nonsense. You are a male who wants to occupy a female body like a parasite

06:30.060 --> 06:34.860
but you can't so you take pills that make you grow pectoral tissue and you paint your face like

06:34.860 --> 06:39.580
a parody of exploited womanhood and even if you do decide to mutilate your genitals you'll still

06:39.580 --> 06:44.700
have big hands and wide shoulders and you'll tower over females like a monster. Society needs to stop

06:44.700 --> 06:49.100
enabling these ridiculous delusions right now and instead help you to get over the fact that

06:49.100 --> 07:02.140
no amount of makeup and surgery can make you a woman.

07:02.140 --> 07:20.620
That was some good free speech right there. I totally just came. Well hold on aren't you

07:20.620 --> 07:25.260
the one defining womanhood with stereotypes? If wearing high heels doesn't make you a woman

07:25.260 --> 07:30.620
why does having small hands? Because small hands are a result of the same biological features

07:30.620 --> 07:35.420
that engender the female reproductive role for which women, females, are oppressed under

07:35.420 --> 07:41.100
patriarchy. Well even if reproductive control is the original reason patriarchy oppresses women

07:41.100 --> 07:46.460
reproductive capacity is not the criterion society uses when it comes to treating people like women

07:46.460 --> 07:51.740
or men. You think because you identify as a woman society identifies you as one but you're wrong.

07:51.740 --> 07:55.740
You can't just argue from your feelings. If you were a good feminist maybe you'd be willing to

07:55.740 --> 08:00.700
listen to women's accounts of their own experiences but since you aren't we can rely on data.

08:00.700 --> 08:05.500
Trans women experience employment discrimination and domestic violence at rates even higher than

08:05.500 --> 08:10.780
cis women and are less likely to get victim assistance. Well even if trans survey data is

08:10.780 --> 08:14.940
to be trusted being a victim still isn't what makes you a woman. But you said that having a

08:14.940 --> 08:20.060
womb is the reason why women are oppressed which in many cases is demonstrably false. Just because

08:20.060 --> 08:24.220
some men are victims of sexual violence doesn't mean that they're women. But if they feel like

08:24.220 --> 08:29.340
women, live like women, and experience misogyny like women why is having a womb still more

08:29.340 --> 08:33.500
important? Because that's the original reason women are oppressed in the first place. Even if

08:33.500 --> 08:38.460
that's true it's not always the reason women are oppressed now. What reason could you have to

08:38.460 --> 08:43.260
insist on this apart from pure transphobic prejudice? The reason is that words have to

08:43.260 --> 08:47.980
mean something. I have a definition of womanhood that makes sense and that everyone understands

08:47.980 --> 08:52.300
but you want to tell me that anyone who says they're a woman is a woman and that's the kind

08:52.300 --> 08:57.180
of postmodern nonsense that makes it impossible to politically organize as women and as feminists

08:57.180 --> 09:01.820
which leads to men taking over women's movements and women's spaces. Your assumption is still that

09:01.820 --> 09:07.180
trans women are lying men pretending to be women for what purpose? To enjoy being potentially

09:07.180 --> 09:12.860
rejected by their families, evicted from their homes, abused by the police, and raped in prison?

09:12.860 --> 09:17.260
Why can't you just believe that some people might be radically uncomfortable with their assigned

09:17.260 --> 09:21.740
gender or sex? Because one minute you're telling me that severe mental illness is what makes someone

09:21.740 --> 09:26.300
transgender and the next you'll be asking me to accept that not all trans people transition

09:26.300 --> 09:31.020
and that women with short hair are actually a third gender. This is counter-revolutionary

09:31.020 --> 09:35.900
individualist nonsense that puts personal feelings over political structures. I'm not denying

09:35.900 --> 09:40.460
political structures. I'm telling you that individual people interact with those structures

09:40.460 --> 09:44.860
in ways that don't always correspond to whether or not they have a womb. Well give me a coherent

09:44.860 --> 09:49.260
definition of gender identity that doesn't fall apart on examination and then maybe I'll be

09:49.260 --> 09:54.700
willing to reconsider. Yeah Tiffany can you explain gender identity? I don't really get it.

09:54.700 --> 09:59.100
If you're expecting some ultimate definition that perfectly accounts for everyone then you'll never

09:59.100 --> 10:04.860
be satisfied. But Abigail has no room to talk. She just defined women as people with wombs.

10:04.860 --> 10:09.980
Well what about women who get hysterectomies? They still have xx chromosomes. Well what about

10:09.980 --> 10:15.580
women with Swyer syndrome who have a uterus but xy chromosomes? That's an aberration. Well god

10:15.580 --> 10:19.980
damn it Abigail every definition is perfect if you ignore everything that doesn't fit the

10:19.980 --> 10:24.780
definition. And if this shitty argument is the only reason you have to disregard the lived

10:24.780 --> 10:29.740
experiences of thousands of trans women well it's hard for me to believe that's anything but

10:29.740 --> 10:35.340
bigotry. Well honey I don't know if we need to be accusing anyone of bigotry but Abigail if you're

10:35.340 --> 10:48.220
so smart then how do you know that she's not a woman?

10:48.220 --> 11:04.300
Does thou bleed? What? Does thou bleed?

11:06.220 --> 11:12.780
I do not menstruate out of my dick if that's what you're asking. Infiltrator never cast thou

11:12.780 --> 11:18.700
into the sisterhood of the blind. Good I just want to pee I don't want to be part of your creepy

11:18.700 --> 11:24.700
vagina cult. Oh and now vaginas are creepy this is exactly the kind of anti-female sentiment I've

11:24.700 --> 11:31.020
come to expect from male feminists. Jackie I'm weary of this toilsome man. Shall we begin the

11:31.020 --> 11:36.300
ritual of the blood? Oh is it that time already? Yeah sure let's do it.

11:42.860 --> 11:47.580
Um what is going on? Well if you're a part of the true sisterhood then maybe you'd know that.

11:47.580 --> 11:56.140
Farewell thou who dost not bleed.

12:17.580 --> 12:28.140
So

12:47.580 --> 12:56.140
so

13:17.580 --> 13:26.140
so

13:38.620 --> 13:42.860
Okay well I'm gonna leave now. Bye!
