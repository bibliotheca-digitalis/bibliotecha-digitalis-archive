0	14540	Hi. I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, where every question is eternal. Should
14540	21120	women be allowed to vote? Can Black people do science? Is a cabal of Jewish elites colluding
21120	28980	with the Trilateral Commission to turn Atlantis gay? I guess we'll never know. The important
29020	38100	thing is that we never stop debating. Do vaccines cause feminism? Where do gay people come from?
38100	48940	What's really inside the moon? Fossils, are they real? Why is there no White History Month? What
48940	57180	if dreams are the real reality? Tonight we'll be debating the question, are trans women women? My
57220	63020	first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, host of the popular YouTube series Trans Tips with Tiffany.
63020	69460	Clarence, could we roll a clip? Hi fam, welcome to Trans Tips with Tiffany with new feminization
69460	74660	secrets every week to help you unlock your inner woman. This week I'll be demonstrating how women
74660	80140	eat barbecued ribs. So you have your rack of ribs and what men usually do is they just take a rib
80140	85500	and they just kind of dig in. Now some guys like it if you do that. They like a girl who's a little
85500	113900	bit messy but if you want to appear more feminine what you should do is just... Fuck. Wow, truly
113900	120300	inspiring. My other guest tonight is Abigail Cockbane, feminist activist and author of The
120300	127220	Trans Menace, Lesbian Genocide and the Rape of Feminism. So tell me Abigail, are trans women
127220	132940	really women? If by trans women you mean men who put on lipstick and invade women's spaces then no,
132940	138820	men are not women. Okay and Tiffany what do you say to that? Um do I really have to respond to
138820	145380	that? Well yes, yes you do. You're here to debate aren't you? The debate must commence Tiffany. The
145380	151580	debate must commence. Well I am a woman. I live my life as a woman. I wake up as a woman. I make love
151580	157900	as a woman. I experience misogyny like a woman. No no no no no no. Females are oppressed under
157900	163460	patriarchy because men want to control our wombs. Men impersonating women do not have wombs and they
163460	167940	cannot be oppressed on that basis. Well what about infertile cis women? Men don't want to control
168100	172740	their wombs but they still experience sexism don't they? Yes because being female means you're
172740	177500	assumed to have female reproductive function. Men do not try to control the reproductive function
177500	182700	of other men pretending to be women. I am not a man pretending to be a woman. When men cat-call
182700	187660	trans women, when they rape us, when they harass us, when they deny us employment, they don't care
187660	191700	that we don't have a womb. They only care that we're women. Well does any of that even happen?
191700	197300	I for one can always tell the difference between a real woman and a man in a wig and I'm pretty sure
197340	201980	so can men. Well you would know that it happens all the time if you were willing to listen to the
201980	209380	experiences of trans women but you're not willing to do that because you are a TERF. What did you
209380	216220	just call me? Yeah what does that mean? A TERF, a trans exclusionary radical feminist. That is a
216220	221820	vicious anti-female slur. You know it's really not. It's just a fact that that's what you are.
221820	226260	If anything it's too generous because there's nothing radical or feminist about your view.
226260	234460	What? You're a bad feminist. What did you say? Yeah this is a hot exchange of ideas. Keep it
234460	239500	going girls. You're a bad feminist. This is just reactionary gender essentialism with a radical
239500	245300	veneer. How dare you say that? I'll teach you a thing or two about gender essentialism. Gender
245300	249900	essentialism is the idea that wearing high heels and a miniskirt makes you a woman. I never wear
249900	255140	high heels or miniskirts. Why do you think trans women do this? Well Caitlyn Jenner. Not all trans
255140	259980	women are Caitlyn Jenner. A lot of trans women are very feminine because we have to be in order
259980	265100	for society to recognize us as women. But long hair and makeup is not what makes us women. This
265100	270100	is just one way of communicating a truth that comes from within. Right so any hairy man who
270100	275100	decides he feels like a woman one day can just strut around naked in a women's locker room with
275100	280340	his genitals flopping around and women who have been abused by men are expected to just allow that
280380	285740	in their safe space. Why is it always hairy and flopping genitals? Trans women as a group are the
285740	290380	most devoted body hair removers I've ever met and they're also some of the least likely to want to
290380	295140	flop their genitals in public. That doesn't matter. To a woman who has been abused the sight of male
295140	299820	genitals is still triggering. Wouldn't a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of flopping? I
299820	304900	don't know but that's not the point. Trans women are not hairy men who decide to wave their genitals
304900	309540	at women. This is just some scenario you've made up in order to scare people into thinking trans
309540	314500	women are really just predatory men. I'm not making it up. It happens all the time. I can send
314500	319060	you at least a dozen Daily Mail articles about it. Oh the Daily Mail that radical feminist
319060	324180	publication we all love so much. I'm sorry can I interrupt here? It seems like the disagreement in
324180	328900	this exchange is about what it means to be a woman. Abigail it seems like the idea you're
328900	334260	bringing to the marketplace is that women are people with vaginas and Tiffany you're trying
334260	339260	to sell us on the idea that a woman is someone who fills the social role of a woman is that right?
339500	344780	Well not exactly. You can reject conventional social roles while still being a woman. That's
344780	349500	why I emphasize psychology. What matters is that you feel at ease with female embodiment
349500	353660	and ill at ease with male embodiment. Well I'm not at ease with female embodiment. Well would
353660	359740	you rather be in a man's body? Ew. No. The problem isn't my body and I'm not gonna mutilate my body
359740	364220	because I'm not delusional like you. The problem is the gendered assumptions that society projects
364220	369580	onto female bodies. If we abolish gender we'll also abolish gender dysphoria. But gender
369580	375100	dysphoria isn't just dissatisfaction with gender dissociations. I don't like my body being viewed
375100	379340	as a passive object any more than you do but that doesn't mean that I'm not dysphoric about
379340	384220	my male characteristics or that I don't prefer inhabiting a female body. But this preference
384220	390060	for a female body is nonsense. You are a male who wants to occupy a female body like a parasite
390060	394860	but you can't so you take pills that make you grow pectoral tissue and you paint your face like
394860	399580	a parody of exploited womanhood and even if you do decide to mutilate your genitals you'll still
399580	404700	have big hands and wide shoulders and you'll tower over females like a monster. Society needs to stop
404700	409100	enabling these ridiculous delusions right now and instead help you to get over the fact that
409100	422140	no amount of makeup and surgery can make you a woman.
422140	440620	That was some good free speech right there. I totally just came. Well hold on aren't you
440620	445260	the one defining womanhood with stereotypes? If wearing high heels doesn't make you a woman
445260	450620	why does having small hands? Because small hands are a result of the same biological features
450620	455420	that engender the female reproductive role for which women, females, are oppressed under
455420	461100	patriarchy. Well even if reproductive control is the original reason patriarchy oppresses women
461100	466460	reproductive capacity is not the criterion society uses when it comes to treating people like women
466460	471740	or men. You think because you identify as a woman society identifies you as one but you're wrong.
471740	475740	You can't just argue from your feelings. If you were a good feminist maybe you'd be willing to
475740	480700	listen to women's accounts of their own experiences but since you aren't we can rely on data.
480700	485500	Trans women experience employment discrimination and domestic violence at rates even higher than
485500	490780	cis women and are less likely to get victim assistance. Well even if trans survey data is
490780	494940	to be trusted being a victim still isn't what makes you a woman. But you said that having a
494940	500060	womb is the reason why women are oppressed which in many cases is demonstrably false. Just because
500060	504220	some men are victims of sexual violence doesn't mean that they're women. But if they feel like
504220	509340	women, live like women, and experience misogyny like women why is having a womb still more
509340	513500	important? Because that's the original reason women are oppressed in the first place. Even if
513500	518460	that's true it's not always the reason women are oppressed now. What reason could you have to
518460	523260	insist on this apart from pure transphobic prejudice? The reason is that words have to
523260	527980	mean something. I have a definition of womanhood that makes sense and that everyone understands
527980	532300	but you want to tell me that anyone who says they're a woman is a woman and that's the kind
532300	537180	of postmodern nonsense that makes it impossible to politically organize as women and as feminists
537180	541820	which leads to men taking over women's movements and women's spaces. Your assumption is still that
541820	547180	trans women are lying men pretending to be women for what purpose? To enjoy being potentially
547180	552860	rejected by their families, evicted from their homes, abused by the police, and raped in prison?
552860	557260	Why can't you just believe that some people might be radically uncomfortable with their assigned
557260	561740	gender or sex? Because one minute you're telling me that severe mental illness is what makes someone
561740	566300	transgender and the next you'll be asking me to accept that not all trans people transition
566300	571020	and that women with short hair are actually a third gender. This is counter-revolutionary
571020	575900	individualist nonsense that puts personal feelings over political structures. I'm not denying
575900	580460	political structures. I'm telling you that individual people interact with those structures
580460	584860	in ways that don't always correspond to whether or not they have a womb. Well give me a coherent
584860	589260	definition of gender identity that doesn't fall apart on examination and then maybe I'll be
589260	594700	willing to reconsider. Yeah Tiffany can you explain gender identity? I don't really get it.
594700	599100	If you're expecting some ultimate definition that perfectly accounts for everyone then you'll never
599100	604860	be satisfied. But Abigail has no room to talk. She just defined women as people with wombs.
604860	609980	Well what about women who get hysterectomies? They still have xx chromosomes. Well what about
609980	615580	women with Swyer syndrome who have a uterus but xy chromosomes? That's an aberration. Well god
615580	619980	damn it Abigail every definition is perfect if you ignore everything that doesn't fit the
619980	624780	definition. And if this shitty argument is the only reason you have to disregard the lived
624780	629740	experiences of thousands of trans women well it's hard for me to believe that's anything but
629740	635340	bigotry. Well honey I don't know if we need to be accusing anyone of bigotry but Abigail if you're
635340	648220	so smart then how do you know that she's not a woman?
648220	664300	Does thou bleed? What? Does thou bleed?
666220	672780	I do not menstruate out of my dick if that's what you're asking. Infiltrator never cast thou
672780	678700	into the sisterhood of the blind. Good I just want to pee I don't want to be part of your creepy
678700	684700	vagina cult. Oh and now vaginas are creepy this is exactly the kind of anti-female sentiment I've
684700	691020	come to expect from male feminists. Jackie I'm weary of this toilsome man. Shall we begin the
691020	696300	ritual of the blood? Oh is it that time already? Yeah sure let's do it.
702860	707580	Um what is going on? Well if you're a part of the true sisterhood then maybe you'd know that.
707580	716140	Farewell thou who dost not bleed.
737580	748140	So
767580	776140	so
797580	806140	so
818620	822860	Okay well I'm gonna leave now. Bye!
