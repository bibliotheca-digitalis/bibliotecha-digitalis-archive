Hello?
What's wrong?
It's my boobs.
What?
I was on the internet and it said that one in eight women get breast cancer.
I just want my boobs to be okay.
My God.
I want your boobs too.
What?
To be safe.
I mean, I want your boobs to be safe.
And all the boobs in the world.
But...
But what can we do?
We will unite on Vlog TV to raise money to save all the boobs of the world.
People aren't going to watch us just for boobs.
Are you kidding?
This, my dear woman, is the internet.
Look, we'll give them an incentive.
For every X amount of money they donate, we will do a shot.
What?
So you mean we'll get drunk?
Yes.
For boobs.
Well...
Alright.
For boobs, then.
And boobs.
For boobs.
