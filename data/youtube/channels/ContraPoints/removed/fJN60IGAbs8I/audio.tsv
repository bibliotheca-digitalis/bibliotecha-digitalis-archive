0	7760	Hello, Comrade Trixie.
7760	9640	Hello, Bruce.
9640	11720	So how's, uh, how's your week been?
11720	12720	Look, it doesn't matter.
12720	14120	This is a framing device.
14120	15120	Just get to the...
15120	16120	What do you want?
16120	20800	Well, that's not very friendly, but I was just wondering if you heard about that, uh,
20800	22800	Nazi getting punched.
22800	27580	Oh yeah, I heard.
27580	28960	Pretty fucking funny, right?
28960	30440	Yeah, it's pretty funny.
30440	32400	Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.
32400	36160	Look, babes, you know, it's a man getting attacked in the street.
36160	40400	And he was a Nazi, so whatever, but there's kind of a limit on how excited I'm gonna get
40400	41400	about that.
41400	42400	I see.
42400	45400	Well, how predictably bourgeois of you.
45400	49240	Well, is it bourgeois not to smash people's faces in the street when you disagree with
49240	50240	them?
50240	52360	Yeah, that's pretty bourgeois.
52360	53360	Fuck you.
53360	55880	Not people you disagree with, you idiot.
55880	57000	Fucking Nazis.
57000	58920	People who actually endorse genocide.
58920	60960	You're not going to seriously defend them, are you?
60960	65000	Well, I'm not going to defend them, I'm just saying that last time I checked, people have
65000	68840	a right to express their political opinions without being clocked on the side of the fucking
68840	69840	head.
69840	73200	Well, what I want to know is why you liberals are so eager to come to the defense of the
73200	77720	poor oppressed Nazis, and so quiet about the systemic violence that threatens the lives
77720	80760	of marginalized people in this country every goddamn day.
80760	84840	I'm not quiet about that, I have a whole fucking YouTube channel about it.
84840	85840	Oh, wow.
85840	89680	Well here, have some brownie points for your heroic YouTube activism.
89680	90680	Alright.
90680	92680	I can't win with people like you, can I?
92680	93880	Why are we friends again?
93880	96520	Don't interrogate the framing device.
96520	98080	Why am I friends with anyone?
98080	100320	Socrates, what is friendship?
100320	105040	Alright, so maybe you're not defending Nazis, but you are tolerating them, and I'd like
105040	107380	to know when you think is the right time to take action.
107380	110480	Is it when the first minorities start being loaded onto trains, or would you prefer to
110480	113280	wait until the smoke is rising from the first extermination camp?
113280	115280	Oh, don't be so fucking dramatic.
115320	118240	Richard Spencer is not going to be running any extermination camps.
118240	121640	He's part of a despised fringe group with no real power.
121640	125280	Donald Trump is not part of a fringe group, but he's not exterminating anyone.
125280	128480	Well tell that to the millions of people who are about to lose their health insurance.
128480	131520	Tell that to the women who are going to die from their botched back-alley abortions.
131520	135200	I mean, tell that to the refugees who are about to be sent back to their home countries
135200	137080	where they're all going to be fucking killed.
137080	138080	So what are you suggesting?
138080	142280	We just start killing Republicans because you think their policies are dangerous?
142280	144200	All that education and no brain.
144200	145200	No shithead.
145200	148560	I'm saying that we have a goddamn duty to disrupt the rhetoric that misleads people
148560	151320	into supporting those policies in the first place.
151320	153240	Disrupt it by punching people in the face.
153240	156800	Why do you keep tearing up over this poor little Nazi with a black eye?
156800	158720	Do I look like I'm crying to you?
158720	162000	I just happen to believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called democracy.
162000	163000	Oh don't you start that.
163000	164000	Let me finish.
164000	167400	Politics is based on a norm of reciprocity, which means I treat my opponents the way I
167400	168720	expect them to treat me.
168720	172640	If I start punching people out to silence their political speech, how can I reasonably
172640	174640	expect them not to do the same to me?
174640	175640	You know, it's cute.
175640	179520	It's actually fucking adorable that you think that Nazis will uphold some norm of
179520	180520	reciprocity.
180520	181520	It's not what I think.
181520	185000	You know, you feel safe because you're white and privileged, and you think you can just
185000	186800	have a reasonable discussion with these people.
186800	187800	I don't think so.
187800	188800	You're fucking wrong.
188800	192120	They might not kill you as soon as the Jews or the blacks, but when the fascist scum take
192120	194160	over, they will come for you.
194160	198040	And when they do, they're not going to give a shit that you tolerated them when you had
198040	199040	the upper hand.
199040	200040	Can I talk?
200040	201040	No.
201040	202040	You need to hear this, so shut up and listen.
202440	203440	I've seen your videos.
203440	206960	You seem to think that the rise of white nationalism is just a laugh a minute wrong.
206960	210680	But what you need to understand is you're a cis white man, and you're privileged that
210680	213240	all of this is just an intellectual exercise to you.
213240	214240	But guess what?
214240	218400	To people of color, and to trans people, and to women, and to immigrants and refugees,
218400	219640	this is a matter of life and death.
219640	220640	Can I say something?
220640	221640	No.
221640	222640	Shut your mouth.
222640	226000	I know your audience is small, but you still have a platform, and you have an obligation
226000	227000	to use it responsibly.
227000	228560	But you know what you are?
228560	232080	You're just a profiteer who exploits social justice for money and attention.
232080	233080	Oh, come on.
233080	237520	You take social justice topics and you reduce them to digestible little pieces of infotainment.
237520	239080	That's all you do.
239080	242800	But then you have the audacity to tell real activists what to think and what methods they
242800	243800	can use.
243800	244800	That's not what I'm doing.
244800	245800	Shut up.
245800	249200	You are the culture industry's effort to subsume and neutralize social justice by making you
249200	251560	safe and palatable for mass consumption.
251560	252560	Mass consumption?
252560	255680	This cross-dressing nonsense is just you riding the wave of public interest and transgender
255680	256680	liberation.
256680	257680	No, no, no.
257800	259120	It's a great breed of bullshit, and you know it.
259120	261960	If you let me talk for one second, I'd explain why that's not fair.
261960	262960	Don't you get it?
262960	264640	You don't get to decide what's fair.
264640	268120	You don't get to show up every couple weeks with some glib burlesque, then collect your
268120	271160	Patreon money and walk away to your champagne and pearls.
271160	272760	Let's not make this about the pearls.
272760	273760	The pearls are…
273760	274760	I'm keeping the pearls.
274760	275760	The pearls are not up for discussion.
275760	278160	You seem to think you're actually helping something, when all you're doing is getting
278160	279920	in the way of real activism.
279920	282400	You are as problematic as it gets, motherfucker.
282400	285600	You make jokes about eating disorders, you're dismissive of cultural appropriation.
285600	286720	So you just want a lecture meal.
286760	288760	And I notice you've got some new outfit every week.
288760	292760	That's good, claiming to advocate social justice while supporting an exploitative textile
292760	293760	industry.
293760	294760	If you don't stop talking, I'm gonna punch you in the face.
294760	295760	You think you're a good person?
295760	296760	Well, you're not.
296760	299360	You're the moral equivalent of a modern-day slave owner, and you wash it all down with
299360	302760	a little casual transphobia, which you think is so fuckin' cute…
312760	313760	What a pisser.
313760	315760	I daresay I've earned a round of golf.
316760	317760	Fuck you.
322760	323760	Fuckin' shit.
335760	336760	Yes.
336760	337760	Fuck you.
346760	347760	Fuck.
347760	348760	Fuckin' shit.
354760	357760	You've at least got to admit, violence is kind of fun, isn't it?
357760	359760	Yep, I guess it is.
359760	363760	The only way it would be more fun is if somebody got seriously hurt.
363760	365760	Well, I'm glad we agree on something.
365760	368760	Look, why don't we give this conversation another shot?
368760	370760	Yeah, I guess.
370760	374760	So, I appreciate your tolerant attitude toward fascist speech, I really do.
374800	377800	Normally your view is the right one, and I see that you're coming from a good place,
377800	381800	but you have to understand that this is not a normal situation.
381800	383800	Fascism isn't just any old political worldview.
383800	388800	It's like a malignant tumor that infects the discourse and ruins every liberal norm.
388800	392800	Well, there's no need to help it along by destroying liberal norms in the name of opposing
392800	393800	it.
393800	394800	You still don't get it.
394800	396800	Violence is the only way to stop this.
396800	399800	Fascism is inherently violent, and debate does nothing.
399800	402800	Violence is the only language fascists understand.
402840	405840	Hitler himself said it, that the only way his movement could have been stopped is if
405840	408840	it had been brutally smashed in its infancy.
408840	412840	Well, don't you think Hitler was overestimating the inevitability of his own success?
412840	416840	People like Hitler don't like to imagine that they could fail, and you give him too
416840	417840	much credit.
417840	421840	You always talk about fascism like it's this hopelessly attractive doctrine instead
421840	424840	of the pretty shabby and repulsive thing that it is.
424840	428840	What you're not getting is that it's designed to be seductive, to be irresistible.
428840	430840	Well, I think you're overstating the case.
430840	431840	I don't feel seduced by fascism.
431880	435880	I mean, it would be kind of nice to actually be proud of my own race for once and of my
435880	436880	own country.
436880	439880	And it can get frustrating being a leftist as a white man.
439880	440880	Are you fucking serious right now?
440880	443880	Because no matter how well you think you've thought through your opinions, any woman,
443880	447880	trans person, or person of color can invalidate them in an instant, just by mentioning their
447880	449880	own personal experiences.
449880	453880	Your political worldview has to be this kind of patchwork of other people's testimony
453880	457880	because your own experiences are tainted by privilege, so you're always sort of alienated
457880	459880	from your political views in that way.
459920	464920	And it would also be nice to get rid of this constant self-doubt and neuroticism, and to
464920	470920	be able to stop saying, I'm sorry that I invaded your space with my whiteness and my
470920	471920	masculinity.
471920	474920	I'll try to be meeker and quieter from now on.
474920	479920	I mean, how great would it be to just be able to say, I am a white man, and my experience
479920	480920	is valid.
480920	481920	Oh my god.
481920	483920	I am beautiful, and I'm proud of being beautiful.
483920	487920	I'm strong, and I'm proud of being strong.
487920	488920	Yes.
488960	489960	Yes.
489960	491960	Hail victory.
491960	492960	Hail Trump.
492960	494960	I am no mere golden man.
494960	497960	I am a golden god.
504960	505960	Wow, dude.
505960	506960	Wow.
506960	508960	I don't know how I got the hammer.
508960	509960	I thought you had it.
509960	512960	Well, I've got it back, and I'm going to bash your fashy face in if you don't stop
512960	513960	this fucking shit.
515960	516960	Oh, calm down.
516960	517960	I was just kidding with you.
518000	519000	Well, it was a little too convincing.
519000	523000	Well, you know, your problem is you won't even allow yourself to enter the emotional
523000	524000	space of the right.
524000	527000	Intellectually, you and I agree on almost everything.
527000	530800	The difference is that you're a leftist with all your heart, whereas I'm only three
530800	532000	quarters of the way there.
532000	537000	I have this one quadrant of my heart that's like a little fascist heart, and it makes
537000	539000	me feel right-wing emotions.
539000	542000	Things like, this is politically correct bullshit.
542000	546000	That's a thought that I have unironically, like, at least once a week.
546040	548040	Not so much a thought, I guess, as a feeling.
548040	550040	This is politically correct bullshit.
550040	553040	And I know that it's wrong, so I don't say it.
553040	556040	Well, okay, sometimes it actually is politically correct bullshit, but most of the time it's
556040	557040	wrong.
557040	559040	But it's still a feeling that I have.
559040	561040	And that's why I can talk to the right.
561040	564040	And you can sense that, and it's why you don't trust me.
564040	566040	Well, now I definitely don't trust you.
566040	570040	That's because people like you refuse to have their ideological purity tainted by the
570040	572040	subtlety and ambiguity of the world.
572080	576080	No, it's because I refuse to associate with people who sympathize with an ideology that
576080	579080	wants me and my family and friends dead.
579080	582080	I didn't say I had sympathies, I said I had right-wing feelings.
582080	587080	And I don't have much control over my feelings, but I can control my thoughts, and that's
587080	589080	why public debate is so important.
589080	592080	I've changed my mind before, so I know that it's possible.
592080	594080	You didn't used to be a fascist, though.
594080	597080	No, but this isn't really about committed fascists.
597080	601080	This is about all the people who are misled into following fascist ideas because they
601120	604120	have no ideological defense against it.
604120	607120	Most Trump supporters are not mindless fascist zombies.
607120	612120	They're ordinary people who've gotten taken in by a specific set of fears and resentments.
612120	617120	And then they run into people like you, and you confirm everything that right-wing demagogues
617120	619120	have told them about the left.
619120	624120	You come across as violent, angry, irrational, politically correct, and humorless.
624120	626120	And no one wants to be around a person like that.
626120	628120	Oh, well I'm sorry.
628160	632160	Well, I guess I and all the other unlikable trash who don't think the prospect of genocide
632160	636160	is hilarious will just step out of your way so you can ride in on your golden underpants
636160	639160	and destroy fascism forever with memes and jokes.
639160	643160	Look, I know you think I'm frivolous and problematic, but maybe you'd change your
643160	647160	mind if you knew how many people I hear from that tell me I've made them seriously reconsider
647160	649160	their anti-SJW beliefs.
649160	653160	Maybe the reason you think the other side can't be persuaded is that you just suck
653160	656160	at talking to them and don't even make the effort.
656200	660200	The problem with the left is that you prefer to just cloister yourselves away in Mark Sengel's
660200	665200	reading groups and radical feminist safe spaces where you can argue amongst yourselves about
665200	670200	Trotsky and Luxembourg or Judith Butler and bell hooks, and you never make any actual
670200	675200	attempt to engage with the public who you claim to represent with your calls for violence.
675200	678200	Dude, you are literally spewing right-wing talking points right now.
678200	682200	Well, I'm spewing what the public thinks of you, something you refuse to acknowledge
682200	684200	or do anything to change.
684240	688240	You just have no idea how fucking privileged you have to be to even think that calm, rational
688240	693240	discourse is an option in the face of ideologies who want to deny the basic existence of marginalized
693240	694240	people.
694240	697240	Maybe if it was your life at stake, you'd be singing a different song.
697240	700240	That line of thinking only seems plausible to you because you've already made up your
700240	702240	mind that this is going to end in violence.
702240	704240	And that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
704240	708240	You think that advocating violence makes you more radical than me and that it makes you
708240	710240	a better ally, but you don't know that.
710240	713240	You don't know how these hate groups are going to react when you try to attack and
713280	714280	humiliate them.
714280	718280	You think that this is an effective silencing tactic, but what if you're wrong?
718280	723280	Humiliation is a seed of terrorism, and what if instead of being silenced, these fascists
723280	725280	that you want to punch decide to retaliate?
725280	727280	And what if they don't retaliate against you?
727280	731280	What if instead they retaliate against the marginalized people you claim to be defending?
731280	735280	You don't get to pretend that you know how this is going to go down, because you don't.
735280	739280	You don't know either, and you can afford to have this delusional hope that fascists
739280	742280	will just be peacefully persuaded because you're a fucking white male.
742320	743320	You're a fucking white male.
743320	748320	You think that because you picked up the twisted ravings of some continental philosopher, you're
748320	751320	smart enough that you get to decide who lives and who dies.
751320	752320	Well guess what?
752320	756320	There are people all over the political spectrum who think that, and they're called terrorists.
756320	761320	When a Christ-fascist decides to bomb an abortion clinic, he thinks that he's stopping a genocide
761320	766320	against the most marginalized group of all, the sinless lives of the unborn.
766320	769320	But you don't leave any margin of error because you think you've got it all figured out.
769360	772360	Your only rebuttal is to keep reminding me that I'm a white male.
772360	775360	But I can say the same thing to you, you fucking white male.
775360	780360	You're just a privileged piece of shit who likes to wear a ski mask and spear anti-capitalist
780360	782360	slogans because you think it makes you look like a badass.
782360	783360	But it doesn't.
783360	785360	It just makes you look like a privileged fucking asshole.

793360	795360	body type means absolutely nothing to you.

879360	881360	full virtual reality here.
881360	883360	I'm chasing a dog down a long, dark hallway.
883360	887360	I'm naked, and I'm back in high school, but it's not really high school.
887360	891360	When I get to the end of the hallway, there are seven fat heifers and seven emaciated
891360	895360	heifers, and that's when the Pharaoh tells me how I'm going to die.
