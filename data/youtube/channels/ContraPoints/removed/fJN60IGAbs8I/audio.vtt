00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Hello, Comrade Trixie.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.640
Hello, Bruce.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.720
So how's, uh, how's your week been?

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
Look, it doesn't matter.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.120
This is a framing device.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.120
Just get to the...

00:15.120 --> 00:16.120
What do you want?

00:16.120 --> 00:20.800
Well, that's not very friendly, but I was just wondering if you heard about that, uh,

00:20.800 --> 00:22.800
Nazi getting punched.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.580
Oh yeah, I heard.

00:27.580 --> 00:28.960
Pretty fucking funny, right?

00:28.960 --> 00:30.440
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.400
Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.160
Look, babes, you know, it's a man getting attacked in the street.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.400
And he was a Nazi, so whatever, but there's kind of a limit on how excited I'm gonna get

00:40.400 --> 00:41.400
about that.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.400
I see.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.400
Well, how predictably bourgeois of you.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.240
Well, is it bourgeois not to smash people's faces in the street when you disagree with

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
them?

00:50.240 --> 00:52.360
Yeah, that's pretty bourgeois.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.360
Fuck you.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.880
Not people you disagree with, you idiot.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.000
Fucking Nazis.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.920
People who actually endorse genocide.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.960
You're not going to seriously defend them, are you?

01:00.960 --> 01:05.000
Well, I'm not going to defend them, I'm just saying that last time I checked, people have

01:05.000 --> 01:08.840
a right to express their political opinions without being clocked on the side of the fucking

01:08.840 --> 01:09.840
head.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.200
Well, what I want to know is why you liberals are so eager to come to the defense of the

01:13.200 --> 01:17.720
poor oppressed Nazis, and so quiet about the systemic violence that threatens the lives

01:17.720 --> 01:20.760
of marginalized people in this country every goddamn day.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.840
I'm not quiet about that, I have a whole fucking YouTube channel about it.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
Oh, wow.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.680
Well here, have some brownie points for your heroic YouTube activism.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
Alright.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.680
I can't win with people like you, can I?

01:32.680 --> 01:33.880
Why are we friends again?

01:33.880 --> 01:36.520
Don't interrogate the framing device.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.080
Why am I friends with anyone?

01:38.080 --> 01:40.320
Socrates, what is friendship?

01:40.320 --> 01:45.040
Alright, so maybe you're not defending Nazis, but you are tolerating them, and I'd like

01:45.040 --> 01:47.380
to know when you think is the right time to take action.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.480
Is it when the first minorities start being loaded onto trains, or would you prefer to

01:50.480 --> 01:53.280
wait until the smoke is rising from the first extermination camp?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.280
Oh, don't be so fucking dramatic.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.240
Richard Spencer is not going to be running any extermination camps.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.640
He's part of a despised fringe group with no real power.

02:01.640 --> 02:05.280
Donald Trump is not part of a fringe group, but he's not exterminating anyone.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.480
Well tell that to the millions of people who are about to lose their health insurance.

02:08.480 --> 02:11.520
Tell that to the women who are going to die from their botched back-alley abortions.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.200
I mean, tell that to the refugees who are about to be sent back to their home countries

02:15.200 --> 02:17.080
where they're all going to be fucking killed.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.080
So what are you suggesting?

02:18.080 --> 02:22.280
We just start killing Republicans because you think their policies are dangerous?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.200
All that education and no brain.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
No shithead.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.560
I'm saying that we have a goddamn duty to disrupt the rhetoric that misleads people

02:28.560 --> 02:31.320
into supporting those policies in the first place.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.240
Disrupt it by punching people in the face.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.800
Why do you keep tearing up over this poor little Nazi with a black eye?

02:36.800 --> 02:38.720
Do I look like I'm crying to you?

02:38.720 --> 02:42.000
I just happen to believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called democracy.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh don't you start that.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Let me finish.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.400
Politics is based on a norm of reciprocity, which means I treat my opponents the way I

02:47.400 --> 02:48.720
expect them to treat me.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.640
If I start punching people out to silence their political speech, how can I reasonably

02:52.640 --> 02:54.640
expect them not to do the same to me?

02:54.640 --> 02:55.640
You know, it's cute.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.520
It's actually fucking adorable that you think that Nazis will uphold some norm of

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
reciprocity.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
It's not what I think.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.000
You know, you feel safe because you're white and privileged, and you think you can just

03:05.000 --> 03:06.800
have a reasonable discussion with these people.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
I don't think so.

03:07.800 --> 03:08.800
You're fucking wrong.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.120
They might not kill you as soon as the Jews or the blacks, but when the fascist scum take

03:12.120 --> 03:14.160
over, they will come for you.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.040
And when they do, they're not going to give a shit that you tolerated them when you had

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
the upper hand.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
Can I talk?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
No.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
You need to hear this, so shut up and listen.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
I've seen your videos.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.960
You seem to think that the rise of white nationalism is just a laugh a minute wrong.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.680
But what you need to understand is you're a cis white man, and you're privileged that

03:30.680 --> 03:33.240
all of this is just an intellectual exercise to you.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.240
But guess what?

03:34.240 --> 03:38.400
To people of color, and to trans people, and to women, and to immigrants and refugees,

03:38.400 --> 03:39.640
this is a matter of life and death.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.640
Can I say something?

03:40.640 --> 03:41.640
No.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
Shut your mouth.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.000
I know your audience is small, but you still have a platform, and you have an obligation

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
to use it responsibly.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.560
But you know what you are?

03:48.560 --> 03:52.080
You're just a profiteer who exploits social justice for money and attention.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.080
Oh, come on.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.520
You take social justice topics and you reduce them to digestible little pieces of infotainment.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.080
That's all you do.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.800
But then you have the audacity to tell real activists what to think and what methods they

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
can use.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
That's not what I'm doing.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.800
Shut up.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.200
You are the culture industry's effort to subsume and neutralize social justice by making you

04:09.200 --> 04:11.560
safe and palatable for mass consumption.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.560
Mass consumption?

04:12.560 --> 04:15.680
This cross-dressing nonsense is just you riding the wave of public interest and transgender

04:15.680 --> 04:16.680
liberation.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
No, no, no.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.120
It's a great breed of bullshit, and you know it.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.960
If you let me talk for one second, I'd explain why that's not fair.

04:21.960 --> 04:22.960
Don't you get it?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.640
You don't get to decide what's fair.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.120
You don't get to show up every couple weeks with some glib burlesque, then collect your

04:28.120 --> 04:31.160
Patreon money and walk away to your champagne and pearls.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.760
Let's not make this about the pearls.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.760
The pearls areâ€¦

04:33.760 --> 04:34.760
I'm keeping the pearls.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.760
The pearls are not up for discussion.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.160
You seem to think you're actually helping something, when all you're doing is getting

04:38.160 --> 04:39.920
in the way of real activism.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.400
You are as problematic as it gets, motherfucker.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.600
You make jokes about eating disorders, you're dismissive of cultural appropriation.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.720
So you just want a lecture meal.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.760
And I notice you've got some new outfit every week.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.760
That's good, claiming to advocate social justice while supporting an exploitative textile

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
industry.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.760
If you don't stop talking, I'm gonna punch you in the face.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
You think you're a good person?

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
Well, you're not.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.360
You're the moral equivalent of a modern-day slave owner, and you wash it all down with

04:59.360 --> 05:02.760
a little casual transphobia, which you think is so fuckin' cuteâ€¦

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
What a pisser.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.760
I daresay I've earned a round of golf.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.760
Fuck you.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.760
Fuckin' shit.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.760
Yes.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.760
Fuck you.

05:46.760 --> 05:47.760
Fuck.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.760
Fuckin' shit.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.760
You've at least got to admit, violence is kind of fun, isn't it?

05:57.760 --> 05:59.760
Yep, I guess it is.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.760
The only way it would be more fun is if somebody got seriously hurt.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.760
Well, I'm glad we agree on something.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.760
Look, why don't we give this conversation another shot?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.760
Yeah, I guess.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.760
So, I appreciate your tolerant attitude toward fascist speech, I really do.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.800
Normally your view is the right one, and I see that you're coming from a good place,

06:17.800 --> 06:21.800
but you have to understand that this is not a normal situation.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
Fascism isn't just any old political worldview.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.800
It's like a malignant tumor that infects the discourse and ruins every liberal norm.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.800
Well, there's no need to help it along by destroying liberal norms in the name of opposing

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
it.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
You still don't get it.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800
Violence is the only way to stop this.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.800
Fascism is inherently violent, and debate does nothing.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.800
Violence is the only language fascists understand.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.840
Hitler himself said it, that the only way his movement could have been stopped is if

06:45.840 --> 06:48.840
it had been brutally smashed in its infancy.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.840
Well, don't you think Hitler was overestimating the inevitability of his own success?

06:52.840 --> 06:56.840
People like Hitler don't like to imagine that they could fail, and you give him too

06:56.840 --> 06:57.840
much credit.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.840
You always talk about fascism like it's this hopelessly attractive doctrine instead

07:01.840 --> 07:04.840
of the pretty shabby and repulsive thing that it is.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.840
What you're not getting is that it's designed to be seductive, to be irresistible.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.840
Well, I think you're overstating the case.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.840
I don't feel seduced by fascism.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.880
I mean, it would be kind of nice to actually be proud of my own race for once and of my

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
own country.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.880
And it can get frustrating being a leftist as a white man.

07:19.880 --> 07:20.880
Are you fucking serious right now?

07:20.880 --> 07:23.880
Because no matter how well you think you've thought through your opinions, any woman,

07:23.880 --> 07:27.880
trans person, or person of color can invalidate them in an instant, just by mentioning their

07:27.880 --> 07:29.880
own personal experiences.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.880
Your political worldview has to be this kind of patchwork of other people's testimony

07:33.880 --> 07:37.880
because your own experiences are tainted by privilege, so you're always sort of alienated

07:37.880 --> 07:39.880
from your political views in that way.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.920
And it would also be nice to get rid of this constant self-doubt and neuroticism, and to

07:44.920 --> 07:50.920
be able to stop saying, I'm sorry that I invaded your space with my whiteness and my

07:50.920 --> 07:51.920
masculinity.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.920
I'll try to be meeker and quieter from now on.

07:54.920 --> 07:59.920
I mean, how great would it be to just be able to say, I am a white man, and my experience

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
is valid.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.920
Oh my god.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
I am beautiful, and I'm proud of being beautiful.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.920
I'm strong, and I'm proud of being strong.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.920
Yes.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.960
Yes.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.960
Hail victory.

08:11.960 --> 08:12.960
Hail Trump.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.960
I am no mere golden man.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.960
I am a golden god.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
Wow, dude.

08:25.960 --> 08:26.960
Wow.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
I don't know how I got the hammer.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
I thought you had it.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.960
Well, I've got it back, and I'm going to bash your fashy face in if you don't stop

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
this fucking shit.

08:35.960 --> 08:36.960
Oh, calm down.

08:36.960 --> 08:37.960
I was just kidding with you.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, it was a little too convincing.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, you know, your problem is you won't even allow yourself to enter the emotional

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
space of the right.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Intellectually, you and I agree on almost everything.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.800
The difference is that you're a leftist with all your heart, whereas I'm only three

08:50.800 --> 08:52.000
quarters of the way there.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I have this one quadrant of my heart that's like a little fascist heart, and it makes

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
me feel right-wing emotions.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Things like, this is politically correct bullshit.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
That's a thought that I have unironically, like, at least once a week.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.040
Not so much a thought, I guess, as a feeling.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.040
This is politically correct bullshit.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.040
And I know that it's wrong, so I don't say it.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.040
Well, okay, sometimes it actually is politically correct bullshit, but most of the time it's

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
wrong.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
But it's still a feeling that I have.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
And that's why I can talk to the right.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.040
And you can sense that, and it's why you don't trust me.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.040
Well, now I definitely don't trust you.

09:26.040 --> 09:30.040
That's because people like you refuse to have their ideological purity tainted by the

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
subtlety and ambiguity of the world.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.080
No, it's because I refuse to associate with people who sympathize with an ideology that

09:36.080 --> 09:39.080
wants me and my family and friends dead.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.080
I didn't say I had sympathies, I said I had right-wing feelings.

09:42.080 --> 09:47.080
And I don't have much control over my feelings, but I can control my thoughts, and that's

09:47.080 --> 09:49.080
why public debate is so important.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.080
I've changed my mind before, so I know that it's possible.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.080
You didn't used to be a fascist, though.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.080
No, but this isn't really about committed fascists.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.080
This is about all the people who are misled into following fascist ideas because they

10:01.120 --> 10:04.120
have no ideological defense against it.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.120
Most Trump supporters are not mindless fascist zombies.

10:07.120 --> 10:12.120
They're ordinary people who've gotten taken in by a specific set of fears and resentments.

10:12.120 --> 10:17.120
And then they run into people like you, and you confirm everything that right-wing demagogues

10:17.120 --> 10:19.120
have told them about the left.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.120
You come across as violent, angry, irrational, politically correct, and humorless.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.120
And no one wants to be around a person like that.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.120
Oh, well I'm sorry.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.160
Well, I guess I and all the other unlikable trash who don't think the prospect of genocide

10:32.160 --> 10:36.160
is hilarious will just step out of your way so you can ride in on your golden underpants

10:36.160 --> 10:39.160
and destroy fascism forever with memes and jokes.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.160
Look, I know you think I'm frivolous and problematic, but maybe you'd change your

10:43.160 --> 10:47.160
mind if you knew how many people I hear from that tell me I've made them seriously reconsider

10:47.160 --> 10:49.160
their anti-SJW beliefs.

10:49.160 --> 10:53.160
Maybe the reason you think the other side can't be persuaded is that you just suck

10:53.160 --> 10:56.160
at talking to them and don't even make the effort.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.200
The problem with the left is that you prefer to just cloister yourselves away in Mark Sengel's

11:00.200 --> 11:05.200
reading groups and radical feminist safe spaces where you can argue amongst yourselves about

11:05.200 --> 11:10.200
Trotsky and Luxembourg or Judith Butler and bell hooks, and you never make any actual

11:10.200 --> 11:15.200
attempt to engage with the public who you claim to represent with your calls for violence.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.200
Dude, you are literally spewing right-wing talking points right now.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.200
Well, I'm spewing what the public thinks of you, something you refuse to acknowledge

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
or do anything to change.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.240
You just have no idea how fucking privileged you have to be to even think that calm, rational

11:28.240 --> 11:33.240
discourse is an option in the face of ideologies who want to deny the basic existence of marginalized

11:33.240 --> 11:34.240
people.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.240
Maybe if it was your life at stake, you'd be singing a different song.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.240
That line of thinking only seems plausible to you because you've already made up your

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
mind that this is going to end in violence.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.240
And that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.240
You think that advocating violence makes you more radical than me and that it makes you

11:48.240 --> 11:50.240
a better ally, but you don't know that.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.240
You don't know how these hate groups are going to react when you try to attack and

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
humiliate them.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.280
You think that this is an effective silencing tactic, but what if you're wrong?

11:58.280 --> 12:03.280
Humiliation is a seed of terrorism, and what if instead of being silenced, these fascists

12:03.280 --> 12:05.280
that you want to punch decide to retaliate?

12:05.280 --> 12:07.280
And what if they don't retaliate against you?

12:07.280 --> 12:11.280
What if instead they retaliate against the marginalized people you claim to be defending?

12:11.280 --> 12:15.280
You don't get to pretend that you know how this is going to go down, because you don't.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.280
You don't know either, and you can afford to have this delusional hope that fascists

12:19.280 --> 12:22.280
will just be peacefully persuaded because you're a fucking white male.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.320
You're a fucking white male.

12:23.320 --> 12:28.320
You think that because you picked up the twisted ravings of some continental philosopher, you're

12:28.320 --> 12:31.320
smart enough that you get to decide who lives and who dies.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.320
Well guess what?

12:32.320 --> 12:36.320
There are people all over the political spectrum who think that, and they're called terrorists.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.320
When a Christ-fascist decides to bomb an abortion clinic, he thinks that he's stopping a genocide

12:41.320 --> 12:46.320
against the most marginalized group of all, the sinless lives of the unborn.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.320
But you don't leave any margin of error because you think you've got it all figured out.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.360
Your only rebuttal is to keep reminding me that I'm a white male.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.360
But I can say the same thing to you, you fucking white male.

12:55.360 --> 13:00.360
You're just a privileged piece of shit who likes to wear a ski mask and spear anti-capitalist

13:00.360 --> 13:02.360
slogans because you think it makes you look like a badass.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
But it doesn't.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.360
It just makes you look like a privileged fucking asshole.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.360
Are you even a real punk?

13:07.360 --> 13:13.360
Sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, disability, neurotypicality, and

13:13.360 --> 13:15.360
body type means absolutely nothing to you.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.400
You want to be white male, radical shit, piece of shit, you fucking white male, cis-privileged,

13:20.400 --> 13:26.400
neurotypical white male, fucking asshole, piece of shit, you fucking cis white, fucking

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
white male shit.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
And I will bash you, you gutter punk trash.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.400
I'll bash you first, you bougie fuck.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
I'll bash you good.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
Fucking fascist, Nazi sympathizing piece of shit.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
I'll fucking kill you for that.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.400
I'll kill your face off.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.400
I'll kill you too, you white male shit.

13:45.360 --> 13:53.360
Who won?

13:53.360 --> 13:55.360
Who's next?

13:55.360 --> 14:01.360

patrons who sponsored my golf lessons in preparation for this video.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.360
Patron J. Michael Comfort requests that I describe my ideal video game, so we're talking

14:39.360 --> 14:41.360
full virtual reality here.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.360
I'm chasing a dog down a long, dark hallway.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.360
I'm naked, and I'm back in high school, but it's not really high school.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.360
When I get to the end of the hallway, there are seven fat heifers and seven emaciated

14:51.360 --> 14:55.360
heifers, and that's when the Pharaoh tells me how I'm going to die.

15:05.360 --> 15:20.360
Thanks for watching!
