00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Hello, Comrade Trixie.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,640
Hello, Bruce.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,720
So how's, uh, how's your week been?

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Look, it doesn't matter.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,120
This is a framing device.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
Just get to the...

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
What do you want?

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,800
Well, that's not very friendly, but I was just wondering if you heard about that, uh,

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Nazi getting punched.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,580
Oh yeah, I heard.

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,960
Pretty fucking funny, right?

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,440
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,400
Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,160
Look, babes, you know, it's a man getting attacked in the street.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,400
And he was a Nazi, so whatever, but there's kind of a limit on how excited I'm gonna get

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
about that.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
I see.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Well, how predictably bourgeois of you.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,240
Well, is it bourgeois not to smash people's faces in the street when you disagree with

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
them?

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,360
Yeah, that's pretty bourgeois.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Fuck you.

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,880
Not people you disagree with, you idiot.

24
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,000
Fucking Nazis.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,920
People who actually endorse genocide.

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,960
You're not going to seriously defend them, are you?

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, I'm not going to defend them, I'm just saying that last time I checked, people have

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,840
a right to express their political opinions without being clocked on the side of the fucking

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
head.

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
Well, what I want to know is why you liberals are so eager to come to the defense of the

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,720
poor oppressed Nazis, and so quiet about the systemic violence that threatens the lives

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,760
of marginalized people in this country every goddamn day.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm not quiet about that, I have a whole fucking YouTube channel about it.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh, wow.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
Well here, have some brownie points for your heroic YouTube activism.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Alright.

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I can't win with people like you, can I?

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,880
Why are we friends again?

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,520
Don't interrogate the framing device.

40
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
Why am I friends with anyone?

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,320
Socrates, what is friendship?

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
Alright, so maybe you're not defending Nazis, but you are tolerating them, and I'd like

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,380
to know when you think is the right time to take action.

44
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,480
Is it when the first minorities start being loaded onto trains, or would you prefer to

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,280
wait until the smoke is rising from the first extermination camp?

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Oh, don't be so fucking dramatic.

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,240
Richard Spencer is not going to be running any extermination camps.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,640
He's part of a despised fringe group with no real power.

49
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,280
Donald Trump is not part of a fringe group, but he's not exterminating anyone.

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,480
Well tell that to the millions of people who are about to lose their health insurance.

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,520
Tell that to the women who are going to die from their botched back-alley abortions.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
I mean, tell that to the refugees who are about to be sent back to their home countries

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,080
where they're all going to be fucking killed.

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
So what are you suggesting?

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,280
We just start killing Republicans because you think their policies are dangerous?

56
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,200
All that education and no brain.

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
No shithead.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm saying that we have a goddamn duty to disrupt the rhetoric that misleads people

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,320
into supporting those policies in the first place.

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,240
Disrupt it by punching people in the face.

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Why do you keep tearing up over this poor little Nazi with a black eye?

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,720
Do I look like I'm crying to you?

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
I just happen to believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called democracy.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh don't you start that.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me finish.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Politics is based on a norm of reciprocity, which means I treat my opponents the way I

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
expect them to treat me.

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
If I start punching people out to silence their political speech, how can I reasonably

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
expect them not to do the same to me?

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
You know, it's cute.

71
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,520
It's actually fucking adorable that you think that Nazis will uphold some norm of

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
reciprocity.

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
It's not what I think.

74
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,000
You know, you feel safe because you're white and privileged, and you think you can just

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,800
have a reasonable discussion with these people.

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't think so.

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
You're fucking wrong.

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,120
They might not kill you as soon as the Jews or the blacks, but when the fascist scum take

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,160
over, they will come for you.

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,040
And when they do, they're not going to give a shit that you tolerated them when you had

81
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
the upper hand.

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Can I talk?

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
No.

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
You need to hear this, so shut up and listen.

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I've seen your videos.

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,960
You seem to think that the rise of white nationalism is just a laugh a minute wrong.

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,680
But what you need to understand is you're a cis white man, and you're privileged that

88
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,240
all of this is just an intellectual exercise to you.

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
But guess what?

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,400
To people of color, and to trans people, and to women, and to immigrants and refugees,

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,640
this is a matter of life and death.

92
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Can I say something?

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
No.

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Shut your mouth.

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
I know your audience is small, but you still have a platform, and you have an obligation

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to use it responsibly.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
But you know what you are?

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
You're just a profiteer who exploits social justice for money and attention.

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Oh, come on.

100
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,520
You take social justice topics and you reduce them to digestible little pieces of infotainment.

101
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,080
That's all you do.

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,800
But then you have the audacity to tell real activists what to think and what methods they

103
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
can use.

104
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
That's not what I'm doing.

105
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Shut up.

106
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
You are the culture industry's effort to subsume and neutralize social justice by making you

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,560
safe and palatable for mass consumption.

108
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Mass consumption?

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
This cross-dressing nonsense is just you riding the wave of public interest and transgender

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
liberation.

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
No, no, no.

112
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
It's a great breed of bullshit, and you know it.

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,960
If you let me talk for one second, I'd explain why that's not fair.

114
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Don't you get it?

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
You don't get to decide what's fair.

116
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,120
You don't get to show up every couple weeks with some glib burlesque, then collect your

117
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,160
Patreon money and walk away to your champagne and pearls.

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,760
Let's not make this about the pearls.

119
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
The pearls are…

120
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm keeping the pearls.

121
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
The pearls are not up for discussion.

122
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,160
You seem to think you're actually helping something, when all you're doing is getting

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
in the way of real activism.

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,400
You are as problematic as it gets, motherfucker.

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
You make jokes about eating disorders, you're dismissive of cultural appropriation.

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
So you just want a lecture meal.

127
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,760
And I notice you've got some new outfit every week.

128
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,760
That's good, claiming to advocate social justice while supporting an exploitative textile

129
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
industry.

130
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
If you don't stop talking, I'm gonna punch you in the face.

131
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
You think you're a good person?

132
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Well, you're not.

133
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,360
You're the moral equivalent of a modern-day slave owner, and you wash it all down with

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,760
a little casual transphobia, which you think is so fuckin' cute…

135
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
What a pisser.

136
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I daresay I've earned a round of golf.

137
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Fuck you.

138
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Fuckin' shit.

139
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes.

140
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
Fuck you.

141
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Fuck.

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Fuckin' shit.

143
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
You've at least got to admit, violence is kind of fun, isn't it?

144
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Yep, I guess it is.

145
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,760
The only way it would be more fun is if somebody got seriously hurt.

146
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Well, I'm glad we agree on something.

147
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Look, why don't we give this conversation another shot?

148
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Yeah, I guess.

149
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,760
So, I appreciate your tolerant attitude toward fascist speech, I really do.

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Normally your view is the right one, and I see that you're coming from a good place,

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,800
but you have to understand that this is not a normal situation.

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Fascism isn't just any old political worldview.

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
It's like a malignant tumor that infects the discourse and ruins every liberal norm.

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Well, there's no need to help it along by destroying liberal norms in the name of opposing

155
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
it.

156
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
You still don't get it.

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Violence is the only way to stop this.

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Fascism is inherently violent, and debate does nothing.

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Violence is the only language fascists understand.

160
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Hitler himself said it, that the only way his movement could have been stopped is if

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
it had been brutally smashed in its infancy.

162
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Well, don't you think Hitler was overestimating the inevitability of his own success?

163
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,840
People like Hitler don't like to imagine that they could fail, and you give him too

164
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
much credit.

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,840
You always talk about fascism like it's this hopelessly attractive doctrine instead

166
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,840
of the pretty shabby and repulsive thing that it is.

167
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
What you're not getting is that it's designed to be seductive, to be irresistible.

168
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Well, I think you're overstating the case.

169
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I don't feel seduced by fascism.

170
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I mean, it would be kind of nice to actually be proud of my own race for once and of my

171
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
own country.

172
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
And it can get frustrating being a leftist as a white man.

173
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Are you fucking serious right now?

174
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Because no matter how well you think you've thought through your opinions, any woman,

175
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,880
trans person, or person of color can invalidate them in an instant, just by mentioning their

176
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
own personal experiences.

177
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Your political worldview has to be this kind of patchwork of other people's testimony

178
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,880
because your own experiences are tainted by privilege, so you're always sort of alienated

179
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
from your political views in that way.

180
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
And it would also be nice to get rid of this constant self-doubt and neuroticism, and to

181
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,920
be able to stop saying, I'm sorry that I invaded your space with my whiteness and my

182
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
masculinity.

183
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I'll try to be meeker and quieter from now on.

184
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I mean, how great would it be to just be able to say, I am a white man, and my experience

185
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
is valid.

186
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Oh my god.

187
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I am beautiful, and I'm proud of being beautiful.

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I'm strong, and I'm proud of being strong.

189
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Yes.

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Yes.

191
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Hail victory.

192
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Hail Trump.

193
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I am no mere golden man.

194
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,960
I am a golden god.

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Wow, dude.

196
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Wow.

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I don't know how I got the hammer.

198
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I thought you had it.

199
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Well, I've got it back, and I'm going to bash your fashy face in if you don't stop

200
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
this fucking shit.

201
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Oh, calm down.

202
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
I was just kidding with you.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, it was a little too convincing.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, you know, your problem is you won't even allow yourself to enter the emotional

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
space of the right.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Intellectually, you and I agree on almost everything.

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,800
The difference is that you're a leftist with all your heart, whereas I'm only three

208
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,000
quarters of the way there.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I have this one quadrant of my heart that's like a little fascist heart, and it makes

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
me feel right-wing emotions.

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Things like, this is politically correct bullshit.

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a thought that I have unironically, like, at least once a week.

213
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Not so much a thought, I guess, as a feeling.

214
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
This is politically correct bullshit.

215
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
And I know that it's wrong, so I don't say it.

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Well, okay, sometimes it actually is politically correct bullshit, but most of the time it's

217
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
wrong.

218
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
But it's still a feeling that I have.

219
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
And that's why I can talk to the right.

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
And you can sense that, and it's why you don't trust me.

221
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Well, now I definitely don't trust you.

222
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,040
That's because people like you refuse to have their ideological purity tainted by the

223
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
subtlety and ambiguity of the world.

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
No, it's because I refuse to associate with people who sympathize with an ideology that

225
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,080
wants me and my family and friends dead.

226
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I didn't say I had sympathies, I said I had right-wing feelings.

227
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,080
And I don't have much control over my feelings, but I can control my thoughts, and that's

228
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
why public debate is so important.

229
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
I've changed my mind before, so I know that it's possible.

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
You didn't used to be a fascist, though.

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
No, but this isn't really about committed fascists.

232
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,080
This is about all the people who are misled into following fascist ideas because they

233
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
have no ideological defense against it.

234
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Most Trump supporters are not mindless fascist zombies.

235
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,120
They're ordinary people who've gotten taken in by a specific set of fears and resentments.

236
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,120
And then they run into people like you, and you confirm everything that right-wing demagogues

237
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
have told them about the left.

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,120
You come across as violent, angry, irrational, politically correct, and humorless.

239
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
And no one wants to be around a person like that.

240
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Oh, well I'm sorry.

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Well, I guess I and all the other unlikable trash who don't think the prospect of genocide

242
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,160
is hilarious will just step out of your way so you can ride in on your golden underpants

243
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
and destroy fascism forever with memes and jokes.

244
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Look, I know you think I'm frivolous and problematic, but maybe you'd change your

245
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,160
mind if you knew how many people I hear from that tell me I've made them seriously reconsider

246
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
their anti-SJW beliefs.

247
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Maybe the reason you think the other side can't be persuaded is that you just suck

248
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
at talking to them and don't even make the effort.

249
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
The problem with the left is that you prefer to just cloister yourselves away in Mark Sengel's

250
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,200
reading groups and radical feminist safe spaces where you can argue amongst yourselves about

251
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Trotsky and Luxembourg or Judith Butler and bell hooks, and you never make any actual

252
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,200
attempt to engage with the public who you claim to represent with your calls for violence.

253
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Dude, you are literally spewing right-wing talking points right now.

254
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Well, I'm spewing what the public thinks of you, something you refuse to acknowledge

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
or do anything to change.

256
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
You just have no idea how fucking privileged you have to be to even think that calm, rational

257
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,240
discourse is an option in the face of ideologies who want to deny the basic existence of marginalized

258
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
people.

259
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Maybe if it was your life at stake, you'd be singing a different song.

260
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
That line of thinking only seems plausible to you because you've already made up your

261
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
mind that this is going to end in violence.

262
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
And that's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

263
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,240
You think that advocating violence makes you more radical than me and that it makes you

264
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
a better ally, but you don't know that.

265
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
You don't know how these hate groups are going to react when you try to attack and

266
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
humiliate them.

267
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,280
You think that this is an effective silencing tactic, but what if you're wrong?

268
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Humiliation is a seed of terrorism, and what if instead of being silenced, these fascists

269
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
that you want to punch decide to retaliate?

270
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
And what if they don't retaliate against you?

271
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,280
What if instead they retaliate against the marginalized people you claim to be defending?

272
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,280
You don't get to pretend that you know how this is going to go down, because you don't.

273
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,280
You don't know either, and you can afford to have this delusional hope that fascists

274
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
will just be peacefully persuaded because you're a fucking white male.

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
You're a fucking white male.

276
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,320
You think that because you picked up the twisted ravings of some continental philosopher, you're

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
smart enough that you get to decide who lives and who dies.

278
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Well guess what?

279
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
There are people all over the political spectrum who think that, and they're called terrorists.

280
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,320
When a Christ-fascist decides to bomb an abortion clinic, he thinks that he's stopping a genocide

281
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
against the most marginalized group of all, the sinless lives of the unborn.

282
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
But you don't leave any margin of error because you think you've got it all figured out.

283
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Your only rebuttal is to keep reminding me that I'm a white male.

284
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
But I can say the same thing to you, you fucking white male.

285
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,360
You're just a privileged piece of shit who likes to wear a ski mask and spear anti-capitalist

286
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
slogans because you think it makes you look like a badass.

287
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
But it doesn't.

288
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
It just makes you look like a privileged fucking asshole.

289
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Are you even a real punk?

290
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, disability, neurotypicality, and

291
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
body type means absolutely nothing to you.

292
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,400
You want to be white male, radical shit, piece of shit, you fucking white male, cis-privileged,

293
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,400
neurotypical white male, fucking asshole, piece of shit, you fucking cis white, fucking

294
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
white male shit.

295
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
And I will bash you, you gutter punk trash.

296
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'll bash you first, you bougie fuck.

297
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll bash you good.

298
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Fucking fascist, Nazi sympathizing piece of shit.

299
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I'll fucking kill you for that.

300
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I'll kill your face off.

301
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll kill you too, you white male shit.

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Who won?

303
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Who's next?

304

patrons who sponsored my golf lessons in preparation for this video.

310
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Patron J. Michael Comfort requests that I describe my ideal video game, so we're talking

311
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
full virtual reality here.

312
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm chasing a dog down a long, dark hallway.

313
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm naked, and I'm back in high school, but it's not really high school.

314
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
When I get to the end of the hallway, there are seven fat heifers and seven emaciated

315
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
heifers, and that's when the Pharaoh tells me how I'm going to die.

316
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Thanks for watching!
