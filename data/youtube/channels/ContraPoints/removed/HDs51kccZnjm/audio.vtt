00:00.000 --> 00:13.080
So I was eight years old when I developed my first serious amphetamine habit.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.360
I guess it began when my grades started to slip.

00:16.360 --> 00:21.000
Now if your parents are poor or uneducated or otherwise naive enough to believe that

00:21.000 --> 00:25.280
grades are the reflection of some kind of merit, what usually happens in these situations

00:25.280 --> 00:26.640
is they just let you fail.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.720
But I was more lucky.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.400
It's luckier, not more lucky you fucking idiot.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.360
See, if you have middle class parents like I do, then bad grades are considered the symptom

00:36.360 --> 00:40.440
of some kind of medical condition, at least when it happens to your fucking kid.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.880
So they took me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Attention Deficit Disorder and prescribed

00:44.880 --> 00:49.800
Adderall, a drug whose effects turn out to be basically the same as high-grade crystal

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
meth.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.760
Now I took this drug for no more than two weeks.

00:52.760 --> 00:57.300
The problem was, once that shit wears off, you sink into a pit of fury and despair, which

00:57.300 --> 00:59.580
I had no way of coping with at the time.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.260
The thing about uppers is, you feel great when you're on them, but when you come down,

01:03.260 --> 01:04.420
you come down hard.

01:04.420 --> 01:08.080
And that is a heavy load to place on the back of an eight-year-old with no experience taking

01:08.080 --> 01:09.500
mind-altering chemicals.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.420
So by middle school, the adults in my life had forgotten about my ADD diagnosis.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.620
But once I hit puberty, I began exhibiting some strange behaviors.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.700
I would show an excessive amount of attention to my personal appearance.

01:20.700 --> 01:25.300
I was known to style my hair for what was deemed an inappropriate amount of time, and

01:25.300 --> 01:37.380
I would sometimes spend up to half an hour in the bathroom doing they-dare-not-speculate-what.

01:37.380 --> 01:41.860
This evidence was laid out before the psychiatric authorities, who diagnosed me at age 15 with

01:41.860 --> 01:46.380
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, for which I was prescribed Zoloft and a regimen of cognitive

01:46.380 --> 01:54.580
behavioral therapy, which, needless to say, did not cure me of my effeminate neurosis.

01:54.580 --> 01:58.580
Well pretty soon I started dating, and dating led to love, and love led to heartbreak, or

01:58.580 --> 02:00.340
at least the teenage version of it.

02:00.340 --> 02:04.140
And this called for new diagnoses, so I was diagnosed with first depression, and then

02:04.140 --> 02:05.140
bipolar disorder.

02:05.140 --> 02:10.300
And I'm not making this up, I've been diagnosed and treated for all these things by actual

02:10.300 --> 02:11.300
psychiatrists.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.860
It was the most intense when I was a teenager.

02:13.860 --> 02:18.340
I was seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist every week, so often that insanity became

02:18.340 --> 02:19.900
part of my identity.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.220
Because when you're 15, there's something kind of romantic about madness, especially

02:23.220 --> 02:28.620
when it's 2005.

02:28.620 --> 02:32.740
When I went off to college I discovered this, and this helped me kick the psychiatry habit,

02:32.740 --> 02:33.740
at least for a while.

02:33.740 --> 02:37.140
But it was only a matter of time before I was seeing another shrink, this time with

02:37.140 --> 02:42.340
some kind of vague anxiety diagnosis, for which I was prescribed Seroquel and Lamictal.

02:42.340 --> 02:46.360
Later on I ended up going to yet another psychiatrist to help me get off of those, which led to

02:46.360 --> 02:49.420
a Klonopin habit that I kicked on my own a couple years ago.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.220
So after nearly two decades of prescription pills, I'm happy to say that I've been off

02:53.220 --> 02:58.100
all psychiatric drugs for a year and a half now, and I have to say, I feel just fine.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.340
I feel just fucking fine.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.820
I feel fine.

03:01.820 --> 03:03.380
I feel just fine.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.360
I feel just fucking fine.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.860
I feel fine.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.900
I feel just fucking fine.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.780
I feel fine, Wendy.

03:10.780 --> 03:11.780
I'm fine.

03:11.780 --> 03:12.780
I'm just fine.

03:12.780 --> 03:13.780
I feel completely fine.

03:13.780 --> 03:14.780
Fine.

03:14.780 --> 03:15.780
Fine.

03:15.780 --> 03:22.780
The octopus boys are trying to siphon my headaches.

03:22.780 --> 03:31.780
This is where mommy used to touch me.

03:31.780 --> 03:36.780
Mommy took my blood.

03:36.780 --> 03:44.780
The shine of milk is nasty.

03:44.780 --> 03:54.780
Not all mommies are good mommies.

03:54.780 --> 04:04.780
Honey, I'm home.

04:15.780 --> 04:22.340
Isn't it great how I'm destigmatizing mental illness by portraying the mentally ill as

04:22.340 --> 04:24.780
a bunch of octopus munching maniacs?

04:24.780 --> 04:28.780
Brave is the word I want you to use when you describe it in the comments.

04:28.780 --> 04:31.780
Well look, I used to be a mental patient.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.320
It's different when we cackle maniacally at each other.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.060
So when I look back at the majority of my life that I was seeing psychiatrists, what

04:40.060 --> 04:44.460
I see are five different diagnoses, at least eight different drugs, many hours spent in

04:44.460 --> 04:48.900
therapy, and thousands of dollars spent by my parents and by insurance companies, and

04:48.900 --> 04:52.160
I have to ask myself, was this really necessary?

04:52.160 --> 04:55.460
And I suppose I don't have the medical qualification to answer that question.

04:55.460 --> 04:59.300
But as someone who spends a lot of time around me, I have to say that there's at least

04:59.300 --> 05:02.340
a chance that in my case, all of this is just nonsense.

05:02.340 --> 05:05.740
And I'm not saying that psychiatry is bullshit or that it doesn't help people.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.860
I know people who will tell you that psychiatry has saved their lives, and for all I know

05:08.860 --> 05:10.260
it may have saved my life.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.980
I just don't know.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.140
What I'm saying is that there's reason to be a little bit skeptical, especially

05:15.140 --> 05:18.700
when you consider that most of the research on these drugs is funded by pharmaceutical

05:18.700 --> 05:22.780
companies with billions of dollars at stake, and that many of the most prescribed psychiatric

05:22.780 --> 05:25.860
drugs barely do better than placebo in a lot of studies.

05:25.860 --> 05:30.340
I guess part of me worries that psychiatry medicalizes ordinary human emotions and treats

05:30.340 --> 05:32.060
them as disease symptoms.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.460
At the heart of that worry is a fundamental question about what is or isn't a medical

05:35.460 --> 05:38.900
condition, and how do we even go about answering that question?

05:38.940 --> 05:41.180
Well, one way would be to take a pragmatic approach.

05:41.180 --> 05:44.340
A medical condition is a problem that we go to the doctor to fix.

05:44.340 --> 05:48.740
So, for instance, the question to ask is, are drugs the best way to manage 8-year-old

05:48.740 --> 05:52.320
boys who don't like sitting still for 8 consecutive hours, or is the problem that

05:52.320 --> 05:54.640
schools place unrealistic demands on them?

05:54.640 --> 05:58.300
Does a moody teenager have bipolar disorder, or is he just moody?

05:58.300 --> 06:02.460
These are the kinds of distinctions that diagnostic criteria are supposed to make, but psychiatric

06:02.460 --> 06:06.900
diagnosis is based almost entirely on the subjective self-reports of patients, or, in

06:06.900 --> 06:09.860
the case of children and teenagers, on the reports of their parents.

06:09.860 --> 06:13.980
Meaning that, if you know what words to say, you can kind of get the diagnosis you're

06:13.980 --> 06:16.540
looking for, or that your parents are looking for.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.380
Now you might think that we can improve this with more advanced neuroimaging or with genetic

06:20.380 --> 06:24.820
testing, but even if that were possible, it wouldn't eliminate some fundamental doubts.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.880
The decision to treat a pattern of thoughts and emotions as a disease can never be a fully

06:28.880 --> 06:30.420
scientific one.

06:30.420 --> 06:35.620
Even if my emotions are statistically abnormal, to call them diseased is inevitably to pass

06:35.660 --> 06:40.220
a kind of value judgement on them, and value judgements lie beyond the scope of science.

06:40.220 --> 06:43.780
I think there are clearly cases of depression and anxiety so debilitating that treating

06:43.780 --> 06:47.740
them as diseases is the best approach, and I don't want to discredit the experience

06:47.740 --> 06:51.460
of anyone who feels that their depression or anxiety is a disease.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.700
However, when I look at the current state of psychiatry, what I see are a lot of drugs

06:55.700 --> 07:01.260
on the market that make you fat, impotent, and possibly suicidal, only to alleviate your

07:01.260 --> 07:06.620
depression to an extent barely greater than, say, inundating your colon with homeopathic

07:06.620 --> 07:09.780
crystals and intoning a sincere prayer to Moloch.

07:09.780 --> 07:13.300
And that, along with the fact that I couldn't afford to see a psychiatrist even if I wanted

07:13.300 --> 07:19.340
to, is the reason that I now prefer not to see my sadness and anxiety as a disease.

07:19.340 --> 07:25.580
Instead, I prefer to think of it as just this perpetual dusk that shrouds my life in a shadow

07:25.580 --> 07:29.380
of harmless, mild despair.

07:29.380 --> 07:34.380
So hail Moloch, hail darkness, let's whip out these crystals, huh?

07:59.380 --> 08:22.220
You may literally be keeping me off the streets, and that is really what's best for everyone,

08:22.220 --> 08:28.900
so thank you.
