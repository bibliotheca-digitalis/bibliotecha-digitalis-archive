1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,080
So I was eight years old when I developed my first serious amphetamine habit.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,360
I guess it began when my grades started to slip.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,000
Now if your parents are poor or uneducated or otherwise naive enough to believe that

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,280
grades are the reflection of some kind of merit, what usually happens in these situations

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,640
is they just let you fail.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
But I was more lucky.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,400
It's luckier, not more lucky you fucking idiot.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,360
See, if you have middle class parents like I do, then bad grades are considered the symptom

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,440
of some kind of medical condition, at least when it happens to your fucking kid.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,880
So they took me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Attention Deficit Disorder and prescribed

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,800
Adderall, a drug whose effects turn out to be basically the same as high-grade crystal

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
meth.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,760
Now I took this drug for no more than two weeks.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,300
The problem was, once that shit wears off, you sink into a pit of fury and despair, which

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,580
I had no way of coping with at the time.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,260
The thing about uppers is, you feel great when you're on them, but when you come down,

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,420
you come down hard.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,080
And that is a heavy load to place on the back of an eight-year-old with no experience taking

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,500
mind-altering chemicals.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,420
So by middle school, the adults in my life had forgotten about my ADD diagnosis.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,620
But once I hit puberty, I began exhibiting some strange behaviors.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,700
I would show an excessive amount of attention to my personal appearance.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,300
I was known to style my hair for what was deemed an inappropriate amount of time, and

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:37,380
I would sometimes spend up to half an hour in the bathroom doing they-dare-not-speculate-what.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,860
This evidence was laid out before the psychiatric authorities, who diagnosed me at age 15 with

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,380
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, for which I was prescribed Zoloft and a regimen of cognitive

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,580
behavioral therapy, which, needless to say, did not cure me of my effeminate neurosis.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Well pretty soon I started dating, and dating led to love, and love led to heartbreak, or

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,340
at least the teenage version of it.

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,140
And this called for new diagnoses, so I was diagnosed with first depression, and then

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,140
bipolar disorder.

32
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,300
And I'm not making this up, I've been diagnosed and treated for all these things by actual

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
psychiatrists.

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,860
It was the most intense when I was a teenager.

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,340
I was seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist every week, so often that insanity became

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,900
part of my identity.

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,220
Because when you're 15, there's something kind of romantic about madness, especially

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,620
when it's 2005.

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,740
When I went off to college I discovered this, and this helped me kick the psychiatry habit,

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
at least for a while.

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,140
But it was only a matter of time before I was seeing another shrink, this time with

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,340
some kind of vague anxiety diagnosis, for which I was prescribed Seroquel and Lamictal.

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,360
Later on I ended up going to yet another psychiatrist to help me get off of those, which led to

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,420
a Klonopin habit that I kicked on my own a couple years ago.

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,220
So after nearly two decades of prescription pills, I'm happy to say that I've been off

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,100
all psychiatric drugs for a year and a half now, and I have to say, I feel just fine.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,340
I feel just fucking fine.

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,820
I feel fine.

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,380
I feel just fine.

50
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,360
I feel just fucking fine.

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,860
I feel fine.

52
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,900
I feel just fucking fine.

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,780
I feel fine, Wendy.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm fine.

55
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm just fine.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,780
I feel completely fine.

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
Fine.

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Fine.

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,780
The octopus boys are trying to siphon my headaches.

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:31,780
This is where mommy used to touch me.

61
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Mommy took my blood.

62
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:44,780
The shine of milk is nasty.

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Not all mommies are good mommies.

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:04,780
Honey, I'm home.

65
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,340
Isn't it great how I'm destigmatizing mental illness by portraying the mentally ill as

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,780
a bunch of octopus munching maniacs?

67
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Brave is the word I want you to use when you describe it in the comments.

68
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Well look, I used to be a mental patient.

69
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,320
It's different when we cackle maniacally at each other.

70
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,060
So when I look back at the majority of my life that I was seeing psychiatrists, what

71
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,460
I see are five different diagnoses, at least eight different drugs, many hours spent in

72
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,900
therapy, and thousands of dollars spent by my parents and by insurance companies, and

73
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,160
I have to ask myself, was this really necessary?

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,460
And I suppose I don't have the medical qualification to answer that question.

75
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,300
But as someone who spends a lot of time around me, I have to say that there's at least

76
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,340
a chance that in my case, all of this is just nonsense.

77
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,740
And I'm not saying that psychiatry is bullshit or that it doesn't help people.

78
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,860
I know people who will tell you that psychiatry has saved their lives, and for all I know

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,260
it may have saved my life.

80
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,980
I just don't know.

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,140
What I'm saying is that there's reason to be a little bit skeptical, especially

82
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,700
when you consider that most of the research on these drugs is funded by pharmaceutical

83
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,780
companies with billions of dollars at stake, and that many of the most prescribed psychiatric

84
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,860
drugs barely do better than placebo in a lot of studies.

85
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,340
I guess part of me worries that psychiatry medicalizes ordinary human emotions and treats

86
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,060
them as disease symptoms.

87
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,460
At the heart of that worry is a fundamental question about what is or isn't a medical

88
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,900
condition, and how do we even go about answering that question?

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,180
Well, one way would be to take a pragmatic approach.

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,340
A medical condition is a problem that we go to the doctor to fix.

91
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,740
So, for instance, the question to ask is, are drugs the best way to manage 8-year-old

92
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,320
boys who don't like sitting still for 8 consecutive hours, or is the problem that

93
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,640
schools place unrealistic demands on them?

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,300
Does a moody teenager have bipolar disorder, or is he just moody?

95
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,460
These are the kinds of distinctions that diagnostic criteria are supposed to make, but psychiatric

96
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,900
diagnosis is based almost entirely on the subjective self-reports of patients, or, in

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,860
the case of children and teenagers, on the reports of their parents.

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,980
Meaning that, if you know what words to say, you can kind of get the diagnosis you're

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,540
looking for, or that your parents are looking for.

100
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,380
Now you might think that we can improve this with more advanced neuroimaging or with genetic

101
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,820
testing, but even if that were possible, it wouldn't eliminate some fundamental doubts.

102
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,880
The decision to treat a pattern of thoughts and emotions as a disease can never be a fully

103
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,420
scientific one.

104
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,620
Even if my emotions are statistically abnormal, to call them diseased is inevitably to pass

105
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,220
a kind of value judgement on them, and value judgements lie beyond the scope of science.

106
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,780
I think there are clearly cases of depression and anxiety so debilitating that treating

107
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,740
them as diseases is the best approach, and I don't want to discredit the experience

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,460
of anyone who feels that their depression or anxiety is a disease.

109
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,700
However, when I look at the current state of psychiatry, what I see are a lot of drugs

110
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,260
on the market that make you fat, impotent, and possibly suicidal, only to alleviate your

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,620
depression to an extent barely greater than, say, inundating your colon with homeopathic

112
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,780
crystals and intoning a sincere prayer to Moloch.

113
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,300
And that, along with the fact that I couldn't afford to see a psychiatrist even if I wanted

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,340
to, is the reason that I now prefer not to see my sadness and anxiety as a disease.

115
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,580
Instead, I prefer to think of it as just this perpetual dusk that shrouds my life in a shadow

116
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,380
of harmless, mild despair.

117
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,380
So hail Moloch, hail darkness, let's whip out these crystals, huh?

118
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:22,220
You may literally be keeping me off the streets, and that is really what's best for everyone,

119
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,900
so thank you.
