0	13080	So I was eight years old when I developed my first serious amphetamine habit.
13080	16360	I guess it began when my grades started to slip.
16360	21000	Now if your parents are poor or uneducated or otherwise naive enough to believe that
21000	25280	grades are the reflection of some kind of merit, what usually happens in these situations
25280	26640	is they just let you fail.
26640	28720	But I was more lucky.
28720	31400	It's luckier, not more lucky you fucking idiot.
31400	36360	See, if you have middle class parents like I do, then bad grades are considered the symptom
36360	40440	of some kind of medical condition, at least when it happens to your fucking kid.
40440	44880	So they took me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Attention Deficit Disorder and prescribed
44880	49800	Adderall, a drug whose effects turn out to be basically the same as high-grade crystal
49800	50800	meth.
50800	52760	Now I took this drug for no more than two weeks.
52760	57300	The problem was, once that shit wears off, you sink into a pit of fury and despair, which
57300	59580	I had no way of coping with at the time.
59580	63260	The thing about uppers is, you feel great when you're on them, but when you come down,
63260	64420	you come down hard.
64420	68080	And that is a heavy load to place on the back of an eight-year-old with no experience taking
68080	69500	mind-altering chemicals.
69500	73420	So by middle school, the adults in my life had forgotten about my ADD diagnosis.
73420	76620	But once I hit puberty, I began exhibiting some strange behaviors.
76620	80700	I would show an excessive amount of attention to my personal appearance.
80700	85300	I was known to style my hair for what was deemed an inappropriate amount of time, and
85300	97380	I would sometimes spend up to half an hour in the bathroom doing they-dare-not-speculate-what.
97380	101860	This evidence was laid out before the psychiatric authorities, who diagnosed me at age 15 with
101860	106380	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, for which I was prescribed Zoloft and a regimen of cognitive
106380	114580	behavioral therapy, which, needless to say, did not cure me of my effeminate neurosis.
114580	118580	Well pretty soon I started dating, and dating led to love, and love led to heartbreak, or
118580	120340	at least the teenage version of it.
120340	124140	And this called for new diagnoses, so I was diagnosed with first depression, and then
124140	125140	bipolar disorder.
125140	130300	And I'm not making this up, I've been diagnosed and treated for all these things by actual
130300	131300	psychiatrists.
131300	133860	It was the most intense when I was a teenager.
133860	138340	I was seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist every week, so often that insanity became
138340	139900	part of my identity.
139900	143220	Because when you're 15, there's something kind of romantic about madness, especially
143220	148620	when it's 2005.
148620	152740	When I went off to college I discovered this, and this helped me kick the psychiatry habit,
152740	153740	at least for a while.
153740	157140	But it was only a matter of time before I was seeing another shrink, this time with
157140	162340	some kind of vague anxiety diagnosis, for which I was prescribed Seroquel and Lamictal.
162340	166360	Later on I ended up going to yet another psychiatrist to help me get off of those, which led to
166360	169420	a Klonopin habit that I kicked on my own a couple years ago.
169420	173220	So after nearly two decades of prescription pills, I'm happy to say that I've been off
173220	178100	all psychiatric drugs for a year and a half now, and I have to say, I feel just fine.
178100	180340	I feel just fucking fine.
180340	181820	I feel fine.
181820	183380	I feel just fine.
183380	185360	I feel just fucking fine.
185360	186860	I feel fine.
186860	188900	I feel just fucking fine.
188900	190780	I feel fine, Wendy.
190780	191780	I'm fine.
191780	192780	I'm just fine.
192780	193780	I feel completely fine.
193780	194780	Fine.
194780	195780	Fine.
195780	202780	The octopus boys are trying to siphon my headaches.
202780	211780	This is where mommy used to touch me.
211780	216780	Mommy took my blood.
216780	224780	The shine of milk is nasty.
224780	234780	Not all mommies are good mommies.
234780	244780	Honey, I'm home.
255780	262340	Isn't it great how I'm destigmatizing mental illness by portraying the mentally ill as
262340	264780	a bunch of octopus munching maniacs?
264780	268780	Brave is the word I want you to use when you describe it in the comments.
268780	271780	Well look, I used to be a mental patient.
271780	276320	It's different when we cackle maniacally at each other.
276320	280060	So when I look back at the majority of my life that I was seeing psychiatrists, what
280060	284460	I see are five different diagnoses, at least eight different drugs, many hours spent in
284460	288900	therapy, and thousands of dollars spent by my parents and by insurance companies, and
288900	292160	I have to ask myself, was this really necessary?
292160	295460	And I suppose I don't have the medical qualification to answer that question.
295460	299300	But as someone who spends a lot of time around me, I have to say that there's at least
299300	302340	a chance that in my case, all of this is just nonsense.
302340	305740	And I'm not saying that psychiatry is bullshit or that it doesn't help people.
305740	308860	I know people who will tell you that psychiatry has saved their lives, and for all I know
308860	310260	it may have saved my life.
310260	311980	I just don't know.
311980	315140	What I'm saying is that there's reason to be a little bit skeptical, especially
315140	318700	when you consider that most of the research on these drugs is funded by pharmaceutical
318700	322780	companies with billions of dollars at stake, and that many of the most prescribed psychiatric
322780	325860	drugs barely do better than placebo in a lot of studies.
325860	330340	I guess part of me worries that psychiatry medicalizes ordinary human emotions and treats
330340	332060	them as disease symptoms.
332060	335460	At the heart of that worry is a fundamental question about what is or isn't a medical
335460	338900	condition, and how do we even go about answering that question?
338940	341180	Well, one way would be to take a pragmatic approach.
341180	344340	A medical condition is a problem that we go to the doctor to fix.
344340	348740	So, for instance, the question to ask is, are drugs the best way to manage 8-year-old
348740	352320	boys who don't like sitting still for 8 consecutive hours, or is the problem that
352320	354640	schools place unrealistic demands on them?
354640	358300	Does a moody teenager have bipolar disorder, or is he just moody?
358300	362460	These are the kinds of distinctions that diagnostic criteria are supposed to make, but psychiatric
362460	366900	diagnosis is based almost entirely on the subjective self-reports of patients, or, in
366900	369860	the case of children and teenagers, on the reports of their parents.
369860	373980	Meaning that, if you know what words to say, you can kind of get the diagnosis you're
373980	376540	looking for, or that your parents are looking for.
376540	380380	Now you might think that we can improve this with more advanced neuroimaging or with genetic
380380	384820	testing, but even if that were possible, it wouldn't eliminate some fundamental doubts.
384820	388880	The decision to treat a pattern of thoughts and emotions as a disease can never be a fully
388880	390420	scientific one.
390420	395620	Even if my emotions are statistically abnormal, to call them diseased is inevitably to pass
395660	400220	a kind of value judgement on them, and value judgements lie beyond the scope of science.
400220	403780	I think there are clearly cases of depression and anxiety so debilitating that treating
403780	407740	them as diseases is the best approach, and I don't want to discredit the experience
407740	411460	of anyone who feels that their depression or anxiety is a disease.
411460	415700	However, when I look at the current state of psychiatry, what I see are a lot of drugs
415700	421260	on the market that make you fat, impotent, and possibly suicidal, only to alleviate your
421260	426620	depression to an extent barely greater than, say, inundating your colon with homeopathic
426620	429780	crystals and intoning a sincere prayer to Moloch.
429780	433300	And that, along with the fact that I couldn't afford to see a psychiatrist even if I wanted
433300	439340	to, is the reason that I now prefer not to see my sadness and anxiety as a disease.
439340	445580	Instead, I prefer to think of it as just this perpetual dusk that shrouds my life in a shadow
445580	449380	of harmless, mild despair.
449380	454380	So hail Moloch, hail darkness, let's whip out these crystals, huh?
479380	502220	You may literally be keeping me off the streets, and that is really what's best for everyone,
502220	508900	so thank you.
