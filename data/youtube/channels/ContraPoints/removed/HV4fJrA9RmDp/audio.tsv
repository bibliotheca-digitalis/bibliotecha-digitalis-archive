0	9160	Hello, and welcome to my first ever attempt at broadcasting a live debate. Fittingly,
9160	15840	the topic is, is it worthwhile to broadcast live debates? And my guest is Ollie, one of
15840	21080	my favorite YouTubers who runs a channel called Philosophy Tube. Link is in the description,
21080	24880	please go check it out. And Ollie, you want to introduce yourself?
25840	31400	Well, yeah, thank you very much for having me on, Nick. As you say, I run a channel called
31400	37400	Philosophy Tube. I do like a 10 minute or so video every week teaching philosophy. When
37400	41080	the British government tripled tuition fees, I decided I'd give away my degree for free
41080	45160	online. So that's what I do. And I'm a long time follower of your work as well, an admirer of it.
45160	49920	Thank you. Yeah, it's funny that you say give away your work for free, because in a sense,
49920	54960	that's also the way I think of what I do, is that I feel that I've been given this kind of
54960	61040	gift of an education from society. And I do feel some obligation to just like, give it out for
61040	66760	free. Because one of the frustrations I think of being in university is how elitist it is and how
66760	73040	much money you have to pay to get access to that information. But anyway, so we're talking about
73040	79440	whether debate is worthwhile. So I thought I'd start just by saying a little bit about why this
79480	87600	topic seems like it needs to be discussed. So I think debate is something that has kind of this
87600	93640	important role in our discourse. We think of it as this cornerstone of democracy. It's something
93640	99800	that we hold up as a way of finding out what is true. But I think in most of our personal
99800	104960	experiences, we know that that's not always the case. Debate seems to have this element of
104960	112280	performance. It seems to often rely on things like people's personal appearance and how likable a
112280	117220	person is, things that have nothing to do with what is true or who's correct. So the question
117220	124000	that's raised is debate as important as we say it is. And it's something that I've been asking
124000	130640	myself recently as I've been doing debates and discussions with conservatives or far-right people
130640	135280	on YouTube. And a lot of people on the left have kind of questioned whether I'm smart to do that.
135280	139400	And the criticism ranges from minor criticism, like you're putting yourself through a lot of
139400	143960	emotional agony for the sake of little benefit, to outright you're doing the wrong thing. You're
143960	152120	giving a platform to people who shouldn't have a platform. Stop doing this. So I don't know. Do
152120	158240	you come to this with a position that you hold in general on the utility of debate?
158240	165800	I don't know. I mean, I come to it with a little bit of personal experience. So I, at my uni,
165800	169880	we were talking about elite institutions, there was a fairly high-flying debate society that I
169880	174480	went along to occasionally, and didn't really find it a massively useful use of my Wednesday
174480	180800	nights. I did win a prize there once, because I deliberately gave a speech that contained an
180800	186160	argument that I knew didn't work. And then they gave me the prize for that speech. And I was like,
187040	192160	probably not going to come anymore, guys. So it was fun. But I don't know, it's interesting. I mean,
192160	199480	the kicker is, is it the way to truth? And I'm not sure it always is. It can be, certainly. But
199480	206680	yeah, I don't think it is always the way to truth for the reasons that you mentioned, because it is
206680	211640	kind of, it can become a grandstanding thing. People can sort of play to the audience a bit
211640	215000	too much. And it can be influenced by things that people have, sort of, that aren't really
215000	220480	relevant to the points, like dress and so on, and likeability and charisma. And so, yeah, I'd
220480	224600	certainly, I mean, if the question is, is it important? I'd say, yeah, yeah, it depends what
224600	229800	you mean by important. It's very important in some senses. But is it the way to truth always,
229800	237280	necessarily? I'm inclined to think maybe not. But I don't know. Maybe, yeah, I'm kind of,
237280	241480	because this is something I'm wondering about at the moment, rather than coming at it directly with
241480	247040	a point I want to argue. I'm living the question, as we say in acting. Because, yeah.
247040	252200	So hang on one second, I'm gonna respond to that. I feel that I may have somehow the
252200	256400	permalink to this debate may have gotten public because a couple people have suddenly added into
256400	260760	this Google Hangout. So I'm gonna make sure that I didn't tweet that link or something stupid like
260760	268480	that. Did I? Was that me? Oh, yeah, maybe it was you. Oops. You might want to delete that tweet.
268960	276560	Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think, okay, hopefully we're good. Otherwise,
276560	280360	we're gonna be inviting random people. Well, which could also be interesting. We can debate
280360	287320	them. But anyway, yeah, so I think bringing up the formal debate society is like, that is kind
287320	295640	of an important point to raise. Because when you have formal debates, people are often assigned
295920	302040	which position of the debate to take. So I know when the high school debate teams and so on,
302040	306920	you win by being the most persuasive. But of course, people don't choose what they're arguing.
306920	311520	So there's a kind of culture that revolves around debate societies or around a professional debate
311520	319240	that involves simply having the greatest rhetoric, not being true. So, I mean,
319240	324760	Classes and so on will sort of have classes in providing sample arguments rather than saying,
324760	330320	you find out whether or not you're correct. It's kind of, the classes are given in light,
330320	335360	as you say, in the rhetoric. And that's kind of weird and interesting. And the fact that,
335360	339280	and how do you measure how persuasive someone is? How do you do that without,
339280	343040	I mean, you have to have like a control group, like a blank audience who know nothing about
343040	347520	anything. And then it's kind of sent in and it's like, who do you agree with? I don't know,
347520	352920	the guy in the red tie, I don't know. So how do you measure how persuasive someone is?
353720	358440	I've actually never been involved in a formal debate team, like in that kind of competitive
358440	361600	environment or competitive debate. What my understanding of the way that works is,
361600	367640	they have judges and judges evaluate arguments. I assume that those evaluations include things
367640	372880	like checking for logical fallacies and things like that, so that the guidelines would include
372880	379800	that the reasoning is sound. But if, I mean, this is not how, for instance, a presidential debate
379800	384480	in the US on CNN gets judged. In fact, in the last few presidential elections, they've,
384480	388040	I don't know if they do this in the UK too, but in the televised coverage of the debates,
388040	394040	they'll include this feature where it sort of shows the audience reaction, like in live time.
394040	399240	So you'll have like, it's like a line graph that's plotted by like how much people agree or
399240	404360	disagree with what the person is saying. Right, right. So if someone starts saying like,
405000	411080	like, hooray for the troops, like I support the troops, the line graph starts going up and up and
411080	416760	up. And if they start saying like, I don't know, no politician would say this, but if they say,
418200	422120	just because you give someone a gun doesn't make them a hero. The graph bottoms out,
422120	428040	everyone hates them. But this purely empirical way of evaluating debate, but both based on
428040	435240	public perception, that seems like a real problem. Because, I mean, the famous instance in the US is
435240	443320	this JFK-Nixon debate, or the first debate where Nixon was like sweaty and not very appealing to
443320	449480	the TV audience. And JFK obviously is this handsome presidential charismatic figure. And so
450760	457240	the perception is very much of the JFP is more presidential and more, you know, so it's
458680	463160	there's a performance art to it. And some of it does have to do with the way you look and so on.
465080	472920	But it's maybe a useful performance, right? I mean, it's in a way, any kind of rhetoric
473560	478600	sometimes can go beyond, rhetoric can be evaluated independently of how true the rhetoric,
478600	483240	independent of the truth of what's being said. So, but you wouldn't want to say that don't have
483240	487240	good rhetoric, because it doesn't have to do with truth. So debating still might be a skill worth
487800	495000	cultivating. Oh, absolutely. And certainly, I've found, like, in acting, this was like what I do,
495000	500520	I'm an actor now. It's that the kind of experience I have of debating in formal debates was very
500520	505480	useful. And yeah, you're right, just because it's there's a sort of performance element to it
505480	510920	doesn't mean that it's not important. And that's kind of what I was into earlier on. And yeah,
510920	515080	it is interesting. I mean, one of the one of the things that's going on in the UK right now is that
515080	520600	we're about to have an election and then the current Prime Minister is not going to be
520600	526840	debating the leader of the main opposition party, Theresa May. She won't debate Jeremy Corbyn,
526840	531240	probably says what she says right now. And that, yeah, that's kind of very interesting.
531240	536440	I was like, why not? And everyone's wondering why she isn't. And some people are saying it's
536440	540440	because she's like, doesn't want to do like the Nixon thing of like, appearing to be a sort of
541400	547080	haunted mannequin. But you know, who knows? And yeah, it's very interesting.
548120	552120	Yeah, so I say when there's there's also something special that happens when someone refuses to
552120	557960	debate or they don't debate, this is usually taken to be like a sign that you Oh, like you,
557960	562120	your ideas won't hold up. Yeah, I get Yeah, I imagine you get that a lot.
563080	566920	I mean, I get it. Maybe less than other people get it, because I have a couple of times
566920	572600	shown up to do these debates. But I also think that there are legitimate reasons to not want
572600	576920	to debate and there are people who shouldn't be debated. So I think there's something to be said
576920	581800	for not debating, for instance, Milo Yiannopoulos. And I know that this is something that I'm
581800	589320	thinking of an article, this well known article by the feminists, Penny read about not debating
589320	596280	Milo, because he is someone who I think most of us think he doesn't really care. He's not interested
596280	601320	in what's true. He's a kind of performance artist. And if you're debating someone like that,
601320	605480	there's part of you that thinks that you've lost if you even show up, because you can't.
607880	612280	This idea of good faith comes up a lot to me too. For instance, as a criticism of my debating Blair
612280	617960	White, that there's a notion that she's someone who's not really willing to kind of meet halfway.
621080	624680	Or not necessarily meet halfway, but who's sort of not interested in
625480	629400	pursuing the truth in some sense. So there's some kind of performance art to it that goes beyond
629400	635560	that. So I think I retract saying meet halfway, because I think meet halfway is kind of a bullshit
635560	639240	thing to expect people to do, especially when you're debating people on the way far right.
639240	646920	You don't want to meet halfway on that. But I think that you use the term rap battle
647720	657000	to describe one way of thinking of debate as a kind of performance art. And this is something
657000	661720	I see on YouTube too, the idea of debate as this kind of like, pwnage contest.
661720	665880	Yeah, I mean, I remember that you had that video, you had a video, it was really good. I forget
665880	669720	which one it was actually, but like, we were like, oh, he came in and like tore you apart,
669720	676520	like went in Socrates and you have panties and so on. It's just like, what is that really?
676520	681240	Is that really the path to truth? Or is it? I've quite been, there's a channel I've been
681240	686360	watching recently, Sean and Jen. I've quite been enjoying Sean and Jen's videos recently. I put it
686360	689400	on while I'm cooking just because I really enjoy Sean's voice. It's a great channel.
689400	694280	Yeah, yeah. And I have to confess, I don't go and watch the videos that Sean's,
694280	698360	Sean admirably says go and watch the videos to make sure I'm not misrepresenting. I do actually
698360	704680	just listen to Sean and Jen because I like Sean's voice. And I put it on while I'm cooking. So I
704680	708280	guess there's even a performative aspect to somebody like that, sort of trying to engage
708280	712440	in this debate. And then maybe it's, I'm just kind of refusing to take it as what it's meant to be.
715080	720280	Yeah, that is kind of interesting. Yeah. So I think like a debate in particular,
720280	725480	so the goal, I guess, what is the goal of debate? I mean, it's not really to persuade the other
725480	730280	person. I don't think that this is a big mistake to think that that's the goal of a debate. So
730280	734760	sometimes people criticize me for doing debates by saying, oh, don't argue with this person. Like,
734760	739640	they'll never persuade them. Well, of course someone persuade them. It's for the sake of
739640	745400	the audience. And so I think that I heard someone's, I forget who, I think this was just
745400	750920	like a random YouTube comment or something I saw. They said that the only thing debate can
750920	756680	accomplish is to make sure that two people aren't straw manning each other. And I think there's some
756680	761320	truth to that. It's sort of what you're doing when you have a debate with someone some of the
761320	765640	time is you're saying, it sounds to me like you're saying this thing that I think is horrible. And
765640	769320	then they say either, yeah, that is what I'm saying, but that's not horrible. Or they say,
769320	774040	no, you've misunderstood me. So in a sense, one of the things debate accomplishes is it sort of,
775640	779720	it helps, it gives people a chance to say that a straw man version of their claim isn't what
779720	785640	their claim is. I suppose, yeah. That might be a good use of it. I quite like that.
786680	791080	I remember somebody said something very intelligent to me this morning when I was
791080	793960	telling them about what I was going to be doing this tonight. They said,
795720	800440	it's quite odd that people would, because I'm sure you get commenters as I do, like demanding
800440	806040	debate saying, oh, this must be debated. Or once you say, you've said this, other YouTubers said
806040	810520	this, you should debate them. And this person said to me this morning, those comments are very
810520	815960	interesting because an intelligent person could infer debate. Like if I'm claiming X and somebody
815960	820440	else is claiming Y, then it's like, well, as long as we understand both claims, then we understand
820440	824760	that there's a debate there. It doesn't need necessarily to be this performative clash,
824760	829320	like tonight at eight, that's a royal rumble between, yeah. It's just kind of not really
829320	835960	required. So, right. This is like definitely a kind of philosophy way of thinking about things
835960	841240	too, is that you should, if you're good, be able to build up an argument based on what you know
841240	845560	two people to say, and you should be able to build, you could sort of an imaginative argument
845560	849960	between two people. And I sort of try to do that in some of, I do some videos where I will do a
849960	854440	kind of dialogue, like I did this Nazi punching video, where I had two sides, each of which I
854440	859480	thought had something of value to say. And I kind of tried to, instead of having an actual debate
859480	865000	about it, just I made a fictional one, where I sort of tried to imagine what, how the two ideas
865000	869720	of a person will clash. And anyone should be able to do this, if you know enough about the side that
869720	875400	you're saying. And some ways that maybe, yeah. And some ways that maybe, go ahead, go ahead.
875400	879800	I said, I suppose the risk of doing yourself and playing both roles, although I kind of as an actor
879800	883800	really appreciate the kind of theatricality of that, I suppose the risk would be somebody saying,
883800	887560	ah, but if it's just one person behind it, then you kind of, you're avoiding the straw manning
887560	890680	thing. So you might still be straw manning them. And I love the video.
890680	895480	The risk with that is you're then speaking for someone else, and so you're definitely a risk
895560	901800	of straw manning. But what you also can do is you can avoid this kind of tonight at nine,
901800	908680	clash of personalities thing. And that is what, to me, one of the most discouraging things about
908680	912760	the way people respond to debates is that when I say, when I've posted that I'm going to have
912760	916440	a discussion with a roaming millennial or whoever I'm talking to on YouTube, a lot of people do
916440	920600	respond with popcorn eating gifts and like, you get the sense that like, oh, they just want to
920600	927400	see this like shit show, go down. Because to avoid the kind of tonight at nine,
927400	931960	clash thing, it's like, well, that's just pints. Like, just go for pints, like, or just do this,
931960	940760	just have this. Like, it's just a chat. It doesn't need to be sponsored by whoever.
941720	945400	Just go have pints. Like, it's fine. But then there are plenty of people I wouldn't want to
945400	948760	have pints with. And I've had plenty of pints with people where it's gotten pretty heated. So
949320	956280	yeah. So I think that I love the idea of it being pints. I mean, I think that's not,
956280	960600	I think that's actually sort of the difference between discussion and debate. And I think on
960600	966680	YouTube, although actually, the debate society at my uni were pretty heavy drinkers as well.
970680	974680	When I was at Georgetown, there was something called the Philodemic Society, which was like
974680	981080	a bunch of LARPing, bougie, pretentious people who wanted to roleplay that they were at Cambridge
981080	986840	in the 1950s. God, they sucked. But not all of them.
986840	988520	LARPing, bougie, Cambridge.
988520	992360	Yeah, it was awful. But yeah, there was also a lot of drinking.
994040	994920	A lot of people going, no!
995720	999880	A lot of people who just love just like wearing a suit and projecting their voice.
999880	1004760	Oh yeah, the debate society that was at my uni. It was suits and ties and gowns.
1007000	1010920	I used to go along, because they used to allow floor speeches at the end of the night.
1010920	1014440	So I was doing quite a lot of stand up comedy at the time. And I used to go along and just
1014440	1018760	do like five minutes of new material, just because I had a cast of audience who weren't allowed to,
1018760	1023640	like, they're not allowed to boo. They're only allowed to either say shame or resign.
1023640	1028760	And I'm like, that's inherently hilarious. So I used to go along and test out my material
1028760	1033480	and try and work it into the topic of it, just to mess with them. It's good fun.
1033480	1037560	Yeah, so but if a discussion is more worth having than debate, I think there's also,
1039480	1043880	maybe there's an issue that comes up a lot lately. Are there people not worth having
1043880	1047400	discussions with? I think the answer to this is clearly yes.
1049080	1051240	Especially in London, where it's five quid a pint. There are plenty of people.
1052200	1060760	Yeah, that's absolutely not worth it. But so I think that there has to, you know,
1060760	1066520	so to build a bridge, there has to be something to build a bridge to. There has to be
1069080	1072600	another person who's sort of genuinely interested in it. And they can't just be interested in
1072600	1079000	bullying you. They can't just be interested in making money. They can't just be a propagandist.
1079080	1081800	So for instance, I think there's no point having discussion with Richard Spencer,
1081800	1084680	as I've discussed at length with this point, because I think there's good,
1084680	1089720	very good reasons to say that nothing he says is genuine. And it's all kind of Trojan horse.
1091400	1095080	That's the thing, isn't it? Is that there are some, there are some, I mean, I did this in my
1095080	1100680	video on kind of white on white supremacist propaganda, which is greatly informed by your
1100680	1105720	video on your super video on white nationalism. Yeah, there are some points of view where it's
1105720	1109160	like if somebody says it's raining all the time, even when it's not raining,
1109160	1113320	it's like, oh, good. It's raining morning. It's like, what exactly does that mean in there?
1113320	1117720	And after a while, it kind of makes me start to wonder, well, what is this person really saying
1117720	1122200	here? If no amount of evidence can sort of convince hardcore Nazis that there really isn't
1122200	1126440	a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, then what are they really saying when they put forward that idea?
1126440	1130200	It's not really the idea that it's true. In which case, I'm kind of wasting my breath trying to
1130200	1135080	show them that it's not. Yeah. And unfortunately, I mean, I completely agree with what you said.
1135080	1140520	Unfortunately, the struggle I've had lately with the whole Nazi issue is that it's a great,
1140520	1145800	it's very difficult convincing many people of this because the rhetoric kind of works.
1146440	1150440	Particularly, I think that someone like Richard Spencer is very good at persuading people. I mean,
1150440	1153880	this is exactly what his goal is. It's to persuade people that actually what he's saying is quite
1153880	1158920	reasonable and should at least be taken seriously. So you sort of get trapped into this position
1158920	1162840	where if you don't take it seriously, it seems like you're the one who hates free speech. You're
1162840	1169400	the real fascist. Well, Carl Schmitt saw this coming, didn't he? In the early 20th century,
1169400	1174360	he said liberalism would slide to the right. What's funny about this is that this notion
1174360	1177720	that liberalism slides to the right or that liberals will side with fascists is something
1177720	1182920	that I've heard this from leftists for years and have sort of vaguely sort of believed it,
1182920	1188360	but I didn't really feel it until recently. On YouTube recently, I honestly feel like
1189320	1195080	you know, Ionesco's play The Rhinoceros. I feel like I'm in The Rhinoceros. There's people turning
1195080	1200360	into rhinoceroses left and right and to see person after person who spent years calling people
1200360	1207320	femor-Nazis and black Hitler and then suddenly real ethno-nationalism comes along and they're
1207320	1212680	like, oh, well, these people are, I don't completely agree with them, but it's not called
1212680	1217640	them Nazis. They're ethno-nationalists. They believe in a peaceful redistribution of population
1217640	1227480	and you're just like, oh my God. It suddenly becomes horribly visible to me that if it comes
1227480	1232200	down to fascism versus anti-fascism, like I see what side these people are on and it's not
1232200	1237560	anti-fascism and it's a terrifying thing to watch happen. I was in a protest a while ago. I mean,
1237560	1241960	viewers in the UK might remember there was a bit of a thing going on in Trafalgar Square about a
1241960	1245800	month or a couple of weeks ago. It all got a bit heated. I was right there in the middle of that.
1245800	1250360	It was interesting because me and this one other guy who was just on his way at work or something,
1250360	1255160	he was in a suit and tie, reasonably elderly gent. We were pinned against the shop window
1255160	1259720	and I was there in my hoodie with my protest sign and he was there in a suit and his
1260280	1267400	very reasonable looking tie. The police were beating and arresting this Antifa guy in front
1267400	1273480	of us and the cry went up from the crowd, who defends the Nazis? Police defend the Nazis.
1274040	1277480	And this guy turned to me and said, it's a horrible thing to say. Why do they say that?
1277480	1283320	And I was like, look, they are. Like, that is what they're doing. And we had an interesting
1283320	1288520	discussion, actually me and him, about sort of people putting forward ideas that aren't really
1288520	1294200	supposed to be true. And so he's like, well, if you don't hear them out, aren't you kind of
1294200	1298840	censoring their viewpoint? And I was like, no, no, you haven't quite got it. Their viewpoint is not
1299800	1304040	like putting it forward as an idea to be true. That's them sort of broadcasting a secret message
1306120	1310200	like a value rather than a fact. So the idea that politics relies on facts,
1311000	1313800	always relies on facts. That's the dangerous thing because of course,
1314920	1317880	politics doesn't always rely on facts as well we know.
1318920	1322840	Yeah. And I think this is the point I have the most difficult persuading people of,
1322840	1328600	that the usual kind of approach that you would take to a conversation or to a political
1328600	1332440	discussion is not the right approach when you're dealing with someone like Richard Spencer.
1334840	1340040	This was basically the whole point of the Roman millennial discussion. And the point that I just
1340040	1347560	was unable to persuade her of is the idea that you're making a fundamental error of some kind
1347560	1353400	if you take what's said as an indication of what's, as like a series of factual propositions
1353400	1357080	about what's true. That's not actually the way this language is functioning.
1357080	1360520	But of course then the question, yeah, not the way the language is functioning. That's a good
1360520	1363560	way of putting it. Then the question becomes, and this is a question I got from some of my
1363560	1366920	commenters when I did my video on white supremacist propaganda, is how do you tell?
1366920	1370520	How do you tell who's really putting forward the kind of, oh, this is true. I really do believe
1370520	1375000	in the world of Jewish conspiracy. And who's putting forward the covert message on the news?
1375000	1379240	How do you tell? Which I suppose, you know, we'd have to do case by case.
1381480	1385880	Yeah, I keep returning to this idea, because it's a big part of my acting training, of living the
1385880	1390920	questions, which is something that I floated in a video recently, which commenters didn't really
1390920	1395400	like very much. Can you say something about that idea?
1395400	1402680	It's really quite fascinating. So the poet, maybe I can find the quote from Rilke, because
1402920	1407400	I'll kind of explain why it's important to the acting training. So a lot of actors,
1407400	1411320	in particular actors in training, face questions like, oh, am I good enough? Or am I too anxious?
1411320	1415320	Can I do this? Can I do that? And to try and sit down and answer that question and persuade
1415320	1421080	oneself of like, yes, I'm good enough to be an actor, is futile, because you can be able to maybe
1421080	1424680	spread yourself intellectually, but you'll still be nervous. So what we've been told is to really
1424680	1429160	take to heart this thing, this quote from Rilke, the poet, who said, be patient toward all that is
1430120	1436200	unsolved in your heart, questions like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a
1436200	1440760	very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you, because you would not
1440760	1446760	be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you
1446760	1452120	will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. And the
1452120	1457800	idea is that not every question can be sort of answered, cut and dry theoretically beforehand.
1457800	1463000	Some things have to be kind of felt out, which is a really interesting idea, because I came from
1463000	1467640	like a very academically theoretical background. And when I came across this idea and came across
1467640	1471880	people who sort of operate like that on the kind of living the questions route, rather than,
1471880	1476200	as I think out to many people who think about the questions and analyze them first,
1476840	1480520	that was very interesting to me. And I'm interested a lot at the moment in this
1481480	1486440	different approach to answering questions, which would seem to go against the kind of debate
1486440	1491240	theory, yes, let's sit down and talk about it, argue about it. Well, maybe let's just see how we go.
1493080	1496600	Yeah, that's interesting that you bring that up, because that also turns out to be a very important
1496600	1502680	point. And a lot of kind of social justice circles and feminism in particular, the idea that
1502680	1508200	there are some questions that you kind of need to rely on an experience to answer or to fully
1508200	1514840	comprehend that you can't just kind of like deduce the answer to these questions. And it's something
1514840	1523080	that—I mean, nothing could illustrate this more ridiculously than a recent incident on YouTube,
1523080	1530920	where a kind of pretty generic anti-SJW YouTuber named The Satiratician made a response to this
1530920	1536760	middle school girl teenager who had made this video. She made this video talking about her
1536760	1543400	experiences being catcalled as a 14, 15-year-old. And his response to this is, do you have any
1543400	1549160	evidence of being catcalled? How am I supposed to believe that you've been catcalled until
1549160	1555400	adequate evidence has been presented? And I'm just like, oh my god. Nothing exemplifies the worst of
1555400	1561400	what is meant by our ironic use of rationals than demanding that a teenage girl provide evidence of
1561400	1566920	having been catcalled. There's just no nuance in that. It's like, look, some conversations
1566920	1570680	acquire different standards of evidence. Like if you ask me for directions in the street and I go,
1570920	1575400	yeah, like, pub's down there. Are you not going to go, well, do you have a map or something?
1576280	1580440	Go and find out. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's enough to just go on.
1580440	1582760	Is there any evidence that the pub is in that direction?
1585960	1587640	Testimony is, I guess, a kind of evidence.
1588680	1592520	It's like the misapplication of a scientific standard of evidence to a situation where that
1592520	1597640	standard of evidence has no place. Right. It's like, yeah, epistemic injustice is—
1597800	1603800	Yes. Epistemic injustice. So that's a phrase that's used in philosophy now.
1604840	1608760	I'm explaining because I don't think this concept is very well known outside of
1609480	1615640	academic philosophy. But it's the notion that some people's—I guess it's a complicated
1615640	1618200	notion. I haven't thought about this a while. But one facet of it that I understand
1619400	1623480	is that some people's testimony is privilege above others, for instance.
1623960	1632840	Yeah. Well, yeah, I did a video on it a while ago and to sum it up, it's the idea that we can
1632840	1639240	sometimes do wrongs to people, specifically in their capacities as knowers of things.
1639800	1645160	So if, for instance, I mean, the example that Fricka uses is from To Kill a Mockingbird,
1645160	1648680	where the jury doesn't believe Tom Robinson's testimony because he's black, right? But she
1648680	1653400	says, look, he's trying to give you an item of knowledge there that he is innocent. And the
1653400	1659160	jury's saying, no, we don't accept that because he's black. She says that's a kind of epistemic
1659160	1664760	injustice. You're denying his ability to add to the collective pool of human knowledge on
1664760	1670680	prejudicial grounds. Yeah. And I guess the most very formal and explicit statement of that would
1670680	1675640	be in traditional Islamic law, I think it's like, what is it, like two women's testimony are needed
1675720	1679960	or something to match the testimony of one man or something along those lines. But I think
1681560	1685880	informally, we have the same thing where a teenage girl says that she's being cackled.
1685880	1690120	And I mean, for the record, anyone over the age of 10 who looks remotely like a woman has been
1690120	1697000	cackled. And so the idea that this, for something that doesn't, it's not an extraordinary claim. In
1697000	1701160	other words, it doesn't require much in the way of evidence. And there's a kind of basic trust that
1701160	1705880	you're supposed to bring to conversations where you believe that what someone says is their
1707080	1711960	everyday experience. I remember my Christian theology teacher telling me something similar
1711960	1714760	about the way the Christian communities view the testimony of women as well.
1715640	1720840	Actually, yeah, it's a topic that's really of interest to, I know, like philosophers of
1720840	1728440	religion and to theologians in general, because so much of faith relies on testimony and relies
1728440	1734120	on people's accounts of subjective experiences. And so this turns out to be the revelation.
1734120	1739320	Yeah, it's a hot topic in philosophy of religion, because it seems like these kind of claims,
1740760	1745240	of course, for people who are secularists or atheists, we reject that kind of testimony.
1747880	1750280	At least not as revealing what it claims to reveal.
1753480	1756120	But of course, religious people need to take it seriously to some extent.
1756760	1762040	Yeah, I guess so. I remember being very interested. I studied Christian theology for a
1762040	1766120	year at uni. And alongside philosophy, I remember being very interested in how Revelation was
1766120	1772840	supposed to work. And back then I was very, I was in a big sort of like rationalist phase.
1772840	1774840	Yeah, I would stay with it.
1774840	1779640	Yeah, I think a lot of people do. Which is not, I know my commenters will jump down my throat and
1779640	1784840	say some people it's not a phase. It's Yes. Okay, fine. For me, it was. Yeah, it was really a lot
1784840	1789160	of Hitchens and Dawkins and so on. So I remember being very sort of critical in lectures. And
1789160	1793480	but then I suppose it's a it's a way of, of living the question. And I remember my,
1794600	1801320	one of my theology lectures, I suppose, I won't name his wife had died of cancer,
1801320	1807160	sort of 20 years prior to his coming to the uni. And he still, he'd kind of been with her this
1807160	1811720	whole time. And he's still very much believed in God. And I remember, I remember I didn't ask him
1811720	1817560	out loud, it would be quite rude. But I remember thinking, like, how do you kind of believe based
1817560	1821400	on that? And I suppose his answer would, having known him being something like lines, he just
1821400	1826440	comes does it one day at a time and sort of lives the question, I guess. And yeah, it's interesting.
1826440	1831720	How did we get on to that? I don't know. But I mean, let's see if I can circle it back around
1831720	1838040	to the debate thing. So sorry, I keep sort of no, no, no, all sorts of ridiculous. My inclination
1838040	1843320	is to go where, to go to whatever topic seems interesting. But, but, but so I think that,
1844200	1848200	so New Atheism, I think presents an interesting case for the argument about debate. Because I
1848200	1852280	think a lot of, so this is a theory that I'm constantly talking about online. A theory I have
1852280	1856680	is that current wave of like rationals is like the kind of direct, a lot of these people that
1856680	1863000	you run into online are in some ways the direct intellectual descendants of New Atheists. So this
1863000	1868120	was the, I mean, New Atheism was the hottest topic on the internet discussion, in the internet
1868120	1873560	political discussion world about, you know, nine or 10 years ago. Yeah, then it just seems to
1873560	1877880	sort of disappear. And then yeah, it disappeared or evolved into the horrible thing it has become.
1877880	1886280	But I think so, so Christopher Hitchens, for instance, is a man who I have many disagreements
1886280	1892920	with. But there's no question that he's one of the great debaters of his time. He was really good
1893160	1898120	he had this, and really good in particular at debating religious people, religious people who
1898120	1902840	are supposed to be this kind of like paradigm case of people who like, they, why would, you know,
1902840	1907480	you can't persuade them, like, why would you, why would you have an argument, you can't talk some
1907480	1913720	out of their faith is the usual idea. But I think a lot of people were persuaded by watching Hitchens
1913720	1918840	debate. And some of this has to do with his arguments being good, I think, I think certainly,
1918920	1927960	but also, this big, booming, single barrel voice that he had. And also just the fact that like,
1929400	1935000	I don't mean in any way to impugn your intellect, but I think that people with English accents in
1935000	1942040	the United States get a bit of an easy pass. Like, I think you're a very smart person,
1942040	1945240	but I believe that you could convince half the state of Ohio that you were the intellect of
1945240	1950920	the century. You know, you're not the first blonde American academic to say that to me.
1950920	1957720	Yeah. And, and, and like, I think that, you know, I think Milo Yiannopoulos benefits from this
1957720	1963720	absurd foolishness of Americans. And that's strange. I mean, sometimes when we when we come
1963720	1967800	to America, we have to play the villains and it's only evil. And sometimes we can just say any old
1967800	1971560	Ross and people will be like, Hmm, yes, very good. Yeah, I think it's I think it's benefited
1971560	1977320	Milo Yiannopoulos, for instance. The problem simply is that Americans have not spent enough
1977320	1985400	time around dumb English people. Yes, yes. I think honestly, a week in London is a cure.
1985400	1989400	A week in London is a cure. A week in London may be a cure for many things and it's
1990680	1995640	many others. Yeah, I moved to London from the north nine months ago and I'm still getting used
1995640	2005160	to it really. It's a terrible place. But so to me, that is this idea, part of the idea
2005720	2014600	that we have online that debate is the like, ultimate. It's kind of is this, this,
2014600	2020120	this fetishistic thing that is the arbiter of truth. I think it comes from the effectiveness
2020120	2026840	of the sort of last movement of sort of intellectuals that were popular on the internet,
2026840	2031400	the fact that debate was used to create advantage by people like Dawkins and Hitchens.
2032520	2037400	Yeah, that's a good point. And maybe not just in the sort of argumentative sort of establishing
2037400	2041240	truth sense, but also in the rhetoric sense, because Hitchens, yeah, he could he could turn
2041240	2047720	a phrase. And so that's maybe that's interesting that it's that it's maybe come out of that to a
2047720	2053880	certain extent. Where do you think it'll go then? I don't know, but I think it looks bad.
2056040	2062280	We talked about like, it seems to be going in this Schmidian direction, right? Like, it seems that
2064680	2069080	that people alleging themselves to be rationalists have kind of, again, applied
2069080	2075640	what they think of as rationalism to white nationalist rhetoric in a naive way and have
2076600	2081000	come to be sort of sympathetic towards it. Whereas, you know, and I think this has to
2081000	2088040	do with the way that that, so this is the most generic imaginable leftist talking point that
2088040	2095720	I'm about to repeat, but like the way that state or systemic violence or pressure or coercion
2095720	2102200	tends to go unseen, whereas any rupture with that tends to look like chaos and violence.
2103160	2106760	So, I mean, you have things to be violent against the backdrop.
2106760	2109800	Again, you're mentioning the fact that in a clash with Antifa and the police, like,
2110760	2114840	nine out of 10 people are going to see horrible Antifa thugs against an agent of law and order.
2116120	2122600	And I think that the same is true. This is something I, this is something that I sort
2122600	2127480	of want to explore in a future video. But I think that oftentimes in debate, you know,
2127480	2133160	if you put a slick white nationalist with a, I don't know, a Jewish person or a black person
2133160	2143240	or gay person, and the white nationalist sits there talking about peaceful ethnic cleansing,
2143240	2147720	and like he simply wants a white homeland, just like everyone else is entitled to.
2147720	2154280	And like, do you go to Japan and insist that they, you know, allow 45 million immigrants?
2154280	2157880	Do you go to Africa and insist that only white people, that they have to allow all
2157880	2161160	these white people? No. So why do you insist that we, you know, so they're making these
2161160	2167320	kinds of like reasonable arguments. And then, if the Jewish person, the black person,
2167320	2172280	the socialist, whoever is the other interlocutor kind of freaks out or calls them a Nazi,
2173160	2177720	the rationals or the liberals will see this, and they'll see like a reasonable person trying
2177720	2180760	to make a point and this unfair person calling them a Nazi.
2181160	2184600	If people only have like four minutes to make their points, the person on the other side
2184600	2189240	doesn't have like time to sit down and go, look, here's like the history of the world.
2192200	2199320	Yeah. And it's the blindness to the violence and the inherent in the idea of white nationalists,
2199320	2204840	or the idea in which this is sort of fundamentally incompatible with meeting, two people meeting in
2204840	2209720	an honest discussion. The idea that this person wants to purge all people like that from society.
2209720	2216920	That's an idea that you can't really meet in a back and forth discussion on even footing.
2216920	2220440	It's not something that can really be up for debate.
2220440	2225320	It's a good question of values, really. Yeah, and very fundamental values. I mean,
2225320	2234600	if you think that the meaning of society is not, you know, that humanity is not what unites us in
2234680	2239800	society and we're not coming to meet each other on terms of humanity, but rather it's race,
2239800	2244440	then you've excluded all people who don't belong to the race from even the discussion,
2244440	2248920	from even participation in the society. And so that's it. The game is up for having discussion
2248920	2252920	between those people. And it's not because the person called them a Nazi or because they got
2252920	2259400	emotional. It's because the race or ethno-nationalist's ideas fundamentally
2259400	2261400	involve the exclusion of that person from politics.
2262760	2267080	Well then, all right. I like the way I just put that better than I ever
2267080	2271000	said it on the roaming millennial thing. I wish I'd copy that.
2272120	2277640	I guess to put it on its head then, because I can anticipate what some of my commenters might say.
2280600	2285240	Your great video, the debate between the hard land left and the bougie liberal,
2285240	2290520	was if we go into it thinking that there definitely has to be violence,
2290520	2296440	then it's a foregone conclusion. I suppose if we start saying things like,
2297000	2301720	this is going to sound really bad, but if we start saying things like there are certain people that
2301720	2306600	we can't debate with, again, I guess the question becomes is how do we know which ones they are?
2307480	2310840	I think that's the question that a lot of my commenters will ask. I think my answer to that
2310840	2318120	might be that, well, that forces us to engage with the idea that actually probably at a bottom
2318120	2323160	level all politics involves violence of some kinds, so it probably forces us to engage with,
2323160	2327400	okay, who are the targets of our violence and why? It forces us to see the end of our
2327400	2330520	own ideological noses, I suppose, whereas normally we don't look at them.
2331960	2335560	Yeah, because there's a sense that any kind of politics that we have will be
2335560	2341400	exclusionary in some way. That doesn't mean they're all equal.
2345880	2351800	But it has to do with who you're excluding. The norms of a liberal society or a society based on
2354040	2361800	free speech, free values, based on separation of church and state, based on all these things,
2361800	2366680	this involves exclusion. So, for instance, in the US the separation clause is supposed to exclude
2366680	2374360	religion from politics in such a way that anyone who wants to make an argument about policy based
2374360	2381560	on their religious convictions, that's excluded. That's off the table. I'm making this as a John
2381560	2389560	Rawls point. You're not in the realm of public reason anymore, I guess, if you want to argue
2389560	2392920	from religious faith. It's interesting because we don't have that in the UK.
2395160	2401720	I guess it's a specifically American idea. If that's only in this election that's going
2401720	2406040	on at the moment, the leader of the liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, was getting brought
2406040	2410360	up on the idea that he was saying gay sex is a sin and so on, and that gay people, he said on
2410360	2414840	Twitter once, that gay people could be cured and so on. He was saying that based on religious
2414840	2418920	arguments. Yeah, we don't have separation of church and state here. In fact, the head of
2418920	2423640	state is also the head of the church. Yes, so I guess I should also clarify that, of course,
2423640	2426920	in practice in American politics, there's religious appeals constantly.
2426920	2430280	Yeah, explicit and coded ones, I understand it.
2430280	2436440	Yeah, explicit ones. The philosophical idea, the John Rawls idea anyway, is that
2438440	2445240	that's sort of not allowed in some moral or philosophical sense that you can't expect
2445240	2448840	because it excludes anyone who doesn't share your faith. You're not making an appeal to the
2449720	2452680	base of precepts that are supposed to be the things that we all agree on.
2454600	2459000	I suppose it's an argument, interestingly, it's an argument based on a kind of personal revelation,
2459000	2465320	I guess. It's an argument based on a kind of personal experience. But then we ourselves
2465320	2471560	were saying only a few minutes ago that sometimes that some people base things on experience and
2471560	2475560	that is very useful. So I guess what I would say what the difference is between listening to a
2475560	2479720	feminist based on their personal experience and appearing at the appeal of a theist on the basis
2479720	2485080	of a revelation has to do with the fact that I think a feminist can reasonably expect other
2485080	2493000	people to give some credence to their personal experience. Whereas I think that a religious
2493000	2499240	person sort of can't really expect people who aren't part of that faith to accept this as a
2499240	2503560	valid reason. Yeah, and I guess also it's to do with the sort of ordinariness and commonality of
2503640	2508600	experience. If somebody makes a video about how they've been cackled, then half of the world's
2508600	2512440	population might be like, yeah, that's a thing that can reasonably happen. Whereas if somebody
2512440	2516680	makes a video about having seen a divine vision in the sky, it's like, well, this is slightly more
2516680	2524680	rare. Yeah, or at least the divine vision claim. Again, it depends on what kind of society you're
2524680	2530440	living in. I'm sure in medieval Christendom, arguments were surely made all the time on the
2530440	2538120	basis of divine revelation. Demons were driven from a pig today. This was considered a valid
2538120	2545000	form of evidence, but because of the sort of philosophical underpinnings of our public reason
2545000	2550040	and our discourse, our society, we don't accept that kind of stuff as valid reasoning. It's not
2550040	2554440	universal enough. Only people who are in this specific faith will accept it. So it's sort of
2554440	2560920	excluded from the discourse of democracy because it's simply too specific to a certain group of
2560920	2567400	people. I suppose that might be why it's... So I guess one thing that follows from this,
2567400	2570760	maybe as concerns a debate topic, is that if you're going to have public discussions,
2570760	2580680	if you're going to have public debates, there's sort of rules that regulate what's allowed in
2580680	2588200	debate. And one of those rules is that you have to sort of appeal to shared precepts in some ways,
2588200	2593720	otherwise there's nothing productive that can happen. If you appeal to a basic value that
2593720	2599800	someone doesn't share, that argument has no sway. Yeah, but also it's interesting sometimes that
2600680	2606440	important matters can rest on facts that aren't always shared very equally. So I mean,
2606440	2611640	maybe going back to that white nationalist versus someone on the left hypothetical thing we're
2611640	2615480	talking about, the kind of white nationalist is banking on the fact that, and maybe
2615480	2619160	reliant themselves on the fact that people generally are ignorant of a lot of
2619800	2627640	facts of history because they just simply aren't taught. Like, I remember once I went on a walking
2627640	2638600	tour of an Irish city, and we were taught all about the history of Ireland on this walking tour,
2639320	2645160	and me and my English friends were like, what? We were just never taught this. It's just not taught
2645160	2650360	in British schools, the extent of the horrors that we did in Ireland. And therefore,
2652440	2656280	certain very important things don't come up in public political debates because of that. So for
2656280	2659080	instance, when we had the Brexit referendum, people were saying, oh, yeah, we're going to
2659080	2665160	close the borders with the EU. And it was not really, I saw very publicly acknowledged that
2665160	2669080	to close the border with the EU would involve building a militarized border across the middle
2669080	2673800	of Ireland, which of course, you can walk down the road being the EU in part to Ireland. And
2673800	2677800	nobody kind of said, hang on a minute, haven't we built enough militarized checkpoints across
2677800	2684760	Ireland? And so that kind of, that lacuna ends up really affecting the debates that are even allowed
2684760	2690760	to occur, never mind that progress in certain directions. Yeah, so I think I guess I'm saying
2690760	2695240	something, I'm trying to say something different, because I think that when you are not appealing,
2695240	2700680	if there is factual information that you want to rely on, that's not widely known, you can always
2700680	2709400	bring up these facts. Because, so, you know, it was Dublin, not Ireland before I get.
2709800	2715560	Yeah. So for the, you know, an American equivalent of this would be, for instance,
2715560	2720760	like people now, Americans are so bewildered as to like, why do North Koreans like hate us so much?
2720760	2724440	Like, they're just crazy. But like, for some reason, they just hate America. And like,
2724440	2728040	everyone forgets, like, no one really seems to have any consciousness of the fact that like,
2728040	2731320	we went to war with them and just bombed the hell out of them. And like, hundreds of thousands or
2731320	2735240	maybe millions of people died. And like, Americans just have never been bombed. We just have no
2735240	2739560	conception of what that feels like. So we just assume, like, I don't know, Koreans are just
2739560	2745320	crazy. Like, they, for some reason, they hate us. I don't know why. Like, why is that? But like,
2746280	2751480	There are people in the UK, I mean, people in the UK say this about Islamic terrorism as well.
2751480	2754440	They're like, oh, why? They just got so angry. And we have MPs who are like, oh,
2754440	2758920	Islam is it? MPs at the MP level of the Conservative Party are like, or former MPs,
2758920	2764440	people like people like Lord Tebbit are like, oh, Islam is incompatible with British values.
2764440	2767160	And it's like, do you think it might have something to do with the Iraq war?
2769000	2772200	You know, when we interviewed captured ISIS soldiers, and they're like, yeah,
2772200	2774920	I'm doing this because of the Iraq war. Everyone's like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
2774920	2777640	it's because the values and freedom, they hate our freedoms. It's like,
2779000	2782520	revenge, revenge, renowned retaliation, you know, the three Rs. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
2784200	2789320	Well, it's very easy to forget a war when it was not waged in your country. And when your
2789320	2793400	people weren't drafted, and when, you know, so a lot of people made money off it as well.
2794120	2798920	So like, I think a lot of Americans are too, with the Iraq war, we're just like,
2798920	2802520	why is like, who still cares about that? Like, that was a long time ago.
2803800	2804520	They're still dead.
2806520	2812920	Just come back and respawn. Yeah, we're not, I can't speak for British curriculum as a whole,
2812920	2817800	but I wasn't really taught about slavery in Britain either. Not our history of slavery.
2817880	2823640	It was kind of, we had sort of 1066, Henry VIII, a little bit of Tudors, Elizabeth I,
2825080	2831320	World War One. It's like, sorry, what happened in between that? What? Oh, what? Nothing happened
2831320	2839880	then. We invaded the world and stole all their money. It's like, ah, there's that weird gap.
2841240	2844440	And for the same reason, we don't do the French Revolution, because that was all happening at the
2844440	2850040	same time. But I suppose with these kinds of things, you can at least bring them up,
2850040	2854840	like you can bring up the factual thing. So that's maybe not like, it's not an absolute
2854840	2859000	obstacle to discourse with someone because you can always bring this stuff up. I think where we have
2859000	2864200	a more difficult problem is when there's a kind of fundamental value that you don't share with
2864200	2870360	a person you're discussing. So I think one reason I find it difficult or impossible to have a real
2870360	2877880	conversation with a Nazi, for example, is that I share as a kind of basic presupposition of my
2877880	2884120	politics that human beings from different groups have equal moral worth as humans.
2891080	2893640	I guess I shouldn't say that because actually I know that they're getting smarter about this.
2893640	2896680	They say, well, we're not white supremacists. We don't think we're more important. We just
2896680	2901560	think that we deserve to have our own thing. So okay, fine. We'll pretend that we actually
2901560	2906360	believe they think that and go with their new thing, which is they think that society
2908040	2915240	should only include people from their race or from the race. And if I don't think that,
2915880	2920520	which I don't, there's almost nothing, like what can we say to each other to convince each other
2920520	2923640	that- There's a lot of point talking about the hows and the whys and the wherefores and the
2923720	2928920	economic this or that. Right. So we can sit around. What's going to happen if I debate
2928920	2934120	Richard Spencer? Suppose I actually am trying to have a conversation with him,
2934120	2937080	which I don't think I would ever try to do because I think that's a waste of time.
2937080	2943720	But let's try to imagine how it would go if I did do that. How am I going to persuade him?
2944520	2950440	We could start by talking about, I'm going to say, well, your plan to be peaceful and ethnic cleansing
2950440	2955240	will surely result in violence or something like that. But come on, the fundamental disagreement
2955240	2960920	is 25 steps before we get to that. But then you've granted him the idea that there's a peaceful,
2960920	2964680	there's even such a thing as peaceful- And I've granted him the idea that
2964680	2968600	peaceful ethnic cleansing would be something that would be okay to do even if we could do it.
2968600	2972200	And even you've granted him the idea that that's what he wants, what he really wants.
2972200	2979800	Yeah. So really the argument should start way before that, which is the idea that
2981080	2985400	so I mean, and they want to state it as an empirical question, right? Like, oh,
2985400	2990520	it's just a fact that diverse societies don't work or something. And they'll have evidence
2990520	2997960	that's supposed to show that. So I guess you sort of can try to use facts to argue values,
2997960	3008440	but often the facts are sort of off the main point. They don't think that they want an
3008600	3013240	ethno-state because diverse societies can't work. That's not really the chain of reasoning.
3013240	3014840	Yeah. I'm willing to put down a five.
3017960	3024680	Yeah. It comes down to the fact that they don't want to share their country with people not like
3024680	3032600	them in certain respects, right? And so they'll do what it takes. Every reason that goes to support
3032600	3037800	that is ultimately kind of post hoc rationalization. That's the right post hoc, that was it.
3037800	3044520	Yeah. And of course you can't prove the psychology of this, of course.
3044520	3050200	No. But again, it's raining. It's good it's raining morning. It's like, what?
3050200	3056920	Yeah. It becomes revealed to you in discussions. No matter how many times you argue that actually
3056920	3063800	unbalanced New York City functions fairly well, despite the fact that it has so much
3063800	3073960	ethnic diversity, they won't hear that. The subject, the conversation has changed.
3073960	3081560	It goes to crime. And then there's a wearing down as well. Nobody has the resource to fill
3081560	3086760	all these lacunas in history and facts and so on and to go through all the sources like someone
3086760	3092520	like Sean and Jen does and to go through every single marker on that map of crimes.
3093320	3097560	They did a great video a while ago where there was like a map of crimes committed by migrants
3097560	3101880	in Germany. And they went through every single one of them and was like, this is listed as arson.
3101880	3105160	There's a guy burning his toast. This is a different time. And they went through every
3105160	3110840	single one, but not everyone has the time to do that. Yes. And it's exhausting and difficult and
3110840	3114520	grueling to go through and debunk everything. And it's ultimately kind of pointless.
3114520	3118040	And it has absolutely no effect on the people who believe that.
3118040	3128200	Yeah. How do you see debate being sort of fetishized on YouTube? Because I see,
3128200	3133720	I get a lot of comments who are like, oh, you wouldn't reply to my comment. Why don't you
3133720	3138440	debate me? I'm like, yeah, that's not a debate. That's just a chat, you know?
3139480	3145320	Well, a lot of these demands that we get to debate are simply like people who,
3146280	3150440	you know, because I've often had people respond to my comment, respond to my comment, respond to
3150440	3158360	them. And if what I say is effective enough, they didn't delete all the comments. So it's bait. It's
3158360	3164120	what it is. It's bait to get you to engage. But I have had some very increasingly rare now.
3164120	3169000	But some of my favorite moments on YouTube is when I get comments of people who are like,
3169080	3175320	really angry. Like, oh, why did you say this? Like, fuck you. And then I go, that's interesting.
3175320	3178280	Tell me more about this. And then some of my favorite moments are when they then come back
3178280	3181880	and they go, I was angry when I said that. I'm sorry. I don't agree with you, but I see where
3181880	3185000	you're coming from. So I really like those engagements. But you're right. I mean, all
3185000	3191240	too often people just, they just want validation, not attention. But there's something like
3191240	3195480	that that they're after. Is it an attachment to our time?
3195480	3201000	Yes. Yeah. Oh, well, online is right. I got emails from like, just like egg accounts on
3201000	3204520	Twitter being like, debate me on my podcast. Like, will you come debate me on my podcast?
3204520	3209720	I'm like, what podcast? Who are you? Like, do you? Why? Like, why? Why would I do that?
3209720	3214280	You know what I mean? Like, it's weird entitlements demand that you
3214280	3218520	It's slightly, slightly cruel. But sometimes when when I get that, I just I just quote them
3218600	3220040	my sort of hourly tuition rates.
3222600	3230600	Yes. Also, I want to be cautious not to get too I mean, we get worn down and on the idea
3230600	3234920	of engagement and become very cynical about it, I think. But I want to be careful not to get too
3234920	3239160	down on the idea of engagement too. Because as you said, like you do have these interactions
3239160	3242440	where someone later comes to you and says like, Oh, I was angry when I said that. And it seems
3242440	3245640	that they actually have thought about what you said. They actually have thought about what they
3245640	3250040	said in the sort of like, this kind of reconsidering has happened. So I definitely
3250040	3255720	have moments like that. And although I think overwhelmingly, the response that I get to doing
3256280	3261000	debates or conversations is just utter uselessness. You know, like, I'm like, put, you know,
3261880	3267080	the, you know, look at look at the comments on, you know, my debates with Blair roaming millennial
3267080	3272280	and you it's a lot of like, why should I take this disgusting training seriously? It's a lot of,
3272280	3276440	you know, just this guy. It's like, wow, I'm really this is really productive here, isn't it?
3276440	3282120	But then you also get I also get an often in private for some reason, the nicer things are
3282120	3287320	said in private, ugly things are said in public. I don't know why this is, but it often is the case.
3287320	3290040	But I'll have private messages from people who say that actually, like,
3291400	3295000	they find the whole thing to be incredibly eye opening and like revelatory and like,
3295000	3298200	and so it's like, okay, well, if some people if some people are getting something like,
3299080	3303720	Hmm, and I suppose if the idea is that everyone should have their say, and that's coming from
3303720	3308520	a place of compassion, then that's good. Like long may we all nurture those compassionate
3308520	3312680	impulses, even if Yeah, even if it is the case that Nazis will try and take advantage of them.
3314280	3317800	Yeah, that's not it's not all become too worn down and cynical.
3318440	3323880	So I guess, yeah, I guess there can be there's really can be a positive effect of debate. I
3323880	3329560	think it's just a matter of being of choosing who you debate with intelligently. So I
3329560	3333480	Which is a question that, you know, that's, that's not exactly ready. That's a living the
3333480	3338440	questions kind of thing. Yes. And so how do you choose? I mean, so I feel like I'm already getting
3338440	3346680	smarter about this. I would never debate Blair White again. Because I think that she's, she
3346680	3350760	doesn't care about what I say, and she doesn't care about what's true. I think that too much
3350760	3355800	of what her focus on is, like I said, I mean, she's a bully, she recently tweeted,
3355800	3358760	I never claimed not to be a bully. So I take it that she won't object to my calling her
3358760	3363800	bullies. She's she's never claimed not to be one allegedly, we now hear but so okay,
3363800	3369000	she's a self professed self without bully. So why bother with that? Like, why? Why go subject
3369000	3374680	yourself to that. But I don't regret the discussion with roaming millennial, even though I think a lot
3374680	3381240	of her audience is horrible. I think that she conducts a discussion in a way where something
3381240	3386280	sort of I mean, even if there's not any movement from the two people involved, it's possible to
3386280	3390440	have a conversation with roaming millennial in a way that people in the audience learn something.
3391720	3397960	And that I think is valuable. That's cool. That's very cool. So it's a matter of Yeah,
3397960	3402280	it's a matter of like getting a feel for who's worth engaging and who isn't. Yeah, yeah.
3403000	3407560	Looking at questions. Absolutely. And that's what I was gonna say was there.
3408600	3413880	And yeah, I can't remember. Maybe they'll come back to me. Yeah.
3417960	3419160	Let's see. Um, so
3422120	3429880	I feel like we we wanted to say enough about the fetishization of debate. I feel like we
3430360	3432120	keep touching on this, but without
3433960	3437800	Well, I can't I can't speak for you. But I get a lot of commenters who are like,
3437800	3442040	yeah, use the word debate when it seems like well, that's not a debate. It's a chat.
3442040	3445800	Or you know what, it's not a debate. So is there a discussion? What's the
3445800	3448040	distinction, I guess, between a debate and a discussion?
3448600	3453560	Oh, well, to my mind debate conjures up because I guess the experience of formal debating conjures
3453560	3459000	up images of sort of time limits and opportunities for people to sort of have rebuttals and speeches
3459000	3462920	from the fore. And it conjures up that image of suits and gowns really, whereas discussion
3463880	3468040	just sounds like more like this, I guess. And yeah, more fun.
3468760	3475880	Informality, a willingness to not so I think in a debate, I guess I would think you kind of
3475880	3480280	your people who have opposed positions, one of you is committed to one side, one of you is
3480280	3485160	committed to the other side. And your job in a debate is to represent the case as good as
3485160	3485960	possible. Yeah.
3487640	3492120	You say, oh, yeah, that's a good point. Like, yeah, maybe you're right. That you've lost like
3492120	3495960	that's bad. Whereas in a discussion, that's great. Because that means it's like, yeah,
3495960	3499000	now we share some common ground. You know, let's have another one.
3499880	3505080	Yes. So I think right in discussion, the attempt is much more to kind of reach some mutual
3505080	3513880	understanding. I guess I think mutual fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I think that people are often
3513880	3520920	so as regards what the goal of the discussion is, I mean, I think only in the best case scenario is
3520920	3524360	any kind of mutual understanding reached that doesn't often happen, especially when you're
3524360	3530520	dealing with people who are ideologically very distant. But I do think that what sometimes
3530520	3535000	happens more often than someone being persuaded in the course of a discussion is I know this is
3535000	3539400	the case with me rarely in my mid discussion, am I going to change my view about something,
3539400	3544200	but often I'll kind of a day or two later, thinking back on it, or like looking into
3544200	3548920	something the other person said, think like, you know what, I am not exactly correct about that.
3549720	3555720	Yeah, yeah. And so maybe that guy I spoke to at that protest, who turned his nose up so much,
3555720	3558840	maybe he's now a month later, maybe he's a committed communist.
3560200	3564200	I think that, yeah, I think that's such an important thought to have. Not necessarily
3564200	3569560	he's a committed communist, but that some of the sense of futility that you have from
3569560	3575640	these discussions, it feels more futile than it is, I think, because maybe that someone
3575640	3580760	ends the debate by saying like, fuck you, Emily, that's the end of the discussion,
3580760	3586920	and they go off in a huff, or you go off in a huff. But later, you may not hear about it,
3586920	3590200	but it may kind of get into them and they might sort of refine their position.
3590760	3593880	Like locker rooms or books that are written in a foreign tongue, absolutely.
3593880	3595160	Yeah, exactly.
3595160	3599160	Live some distant days there and say, yeah, see, the more I experience, the more I think
3599160	3606200	there's wisdom in real life. Oh, that was what I was going to say earlier on. Do you see this kind
3606200	3611560	of, you said that you were kind of learning more better who to engage with and who not to. I
3611560	3619000	remember learning that relatively early on when I did my video on gender. There was a YouTuber who
3619000	3625480	will remain nameless, who made a reply video. I think you know who it is. They made a reply video
3625480	3631880	to my video on gender. And it was hilarious because they quite clearly hadn't watched the
3631880	3635960	whole thing because they started bringing up arguments saying, what about this? What about
3635960	3642360	this? That I myself had mentioned in the video after the six minute mark. And they even, they
3642360	3648040	did it as a collaboration with someone else. And they clearly hadn't watched the whole thing.
3648040	3652360	And they invented, they made all these points. And then I wrote underneath, I was like, but I
3652360	3656600	said that, like, you can't say that I missed this out when I explicitly said it. And then they were
3656600	3660520	like, inventing, like, what if a trans person heard what you were saying about gender? Like,
3660520	3664680	you don't need to invent a hypothetical trans person. I cited two in the video, like,
3665800	3670360	go read this stuff. Like, I think it's a trans person would critique Judith Butler on this. And
3670360	3677320	I'm like, I know, I said that, like, so after that, I don't, and to all those people out there
3677320	3681000	who I know some are planning to make reply videos to my work, and I know some of them make them
3681000	3688600	anyway. I don't really watch them anymore because I don't really find them that useful. Of all the
3688600	3695080	reply videos I've ever watched, about 20 seconds of one of them I found useful. And the guys,
3695080	3698840	I still don't agree with the guy. But that was kind of useful because I hadn't considered it.
3698840	3703960	But the rest, I'm like, I just, I'm not going to watch it because maybe I'm missing out a huge
3703960	3708040	amount. Perhaps my commenters will be able to find ones that are brilliant. But I don't find
3708040	3712680	them all that useful on YouTube, particularly on YouTube. And yeah, listen to commenters and so on.
3712680	3716760	But on YouTube, I think there's a lot of the performative aspects. They're kind of like,
3716760	3724040	oh, the pwnage in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, I agree that there's certain people who's
3724040	3728600	like, responses to me, I'll watch it two times the speed to see the first three minutes and be like,
3728600	3738280	okay, this is good. Yeah. Yeah. But I, yeah, so I think that, you know, you try to stay open,
3738280	3742360	but also if something is, I agree, it's a widespread problem of people just like,
3742360	3747800	grossly misunderstanding things that you say, ludicrous straw manning of your arguments, or
3747800	3753640	again, just giving evidence that they haven't even watched your video. All these are problems.
3753640	3759960	And then also, just the, this is, yeah, you mentioned the video about like, you know,
3759960	3766440	skeptic destroyed your butthole, or whatever the comment that I was getting on these kinds of
3766440	3772120	comments. And so I kind of, yeah, I kind of want to go back to that, that idea of that video where
3772120	3778520	I talked about like, what I think the point of having a response video is, is it to destroy your
3778520	3783320	opponent? Or is it to try? So I think there's people who it's worth responding to. And that's
3783640	3787480	part of what I mean when I talk about choosing debates, is that because a guy like armored
3787480	3794200	skeptic, I disagree with him a lot. But in interacting with him, I get the sense that he's
3794200	3800760	sincere, that he thinks what he says, and that he's somewhat open to like, reconsidering things.
3802440	3807560	So I think that's a person who's worth talking to. And I also think that in order to make the
3807560	3811720	conversation worthwhile, both people have to come to the conversation with the understanding that
3811720	3817880	the goal is a discussion where you're both somewhat curious to get a handle on what that
3817880	3824840	person says. Yeah, curiosity. And you're not decided from the beginning, time to wreck someone
3824840	3830600	like, yeah, like, one of the phrases that we are taught in the end drama school is full of wisdom.
3830600	3835800	One of the things we're taught is curiosity, not ambition. Yes, great phrase, which is a,
3835800	3840840	that's a lovely phrase that Yeah, yeah. So and there's ways that YouTubers can I mean,
3840840	3844760	so this is my suggestion to YouTubers who want to make response videos is there's ways to do
3844760	3849240	response that don't involve pwnage. So if you want to make it entertaining, and I do this, like,
3849240	3853880	think of it in different terms. So I've used like, framing devices for response videos,
3853880	3861640	like inviting the person to dinner, or, or like seducing them, which I think, like, sort of help
3861640	3866360	a little bit to subvert the idea that it's pwnage. Yeah, I see the rabbit mask in the background. I
3866360	3873800	remember that. Yeah. And so so, again, I think if people would look at these alternatives to
3873800	3878680	the wrecking way, there's a way of having these discussions that could go so much better than
3878680	3885480	they tend to go. Hmm. Yeah, because it could be fun. Well, again, yeah, pints, just go for pints.
3885480	3888920	Yes. But I see people like Blair, like, you know, she'll have she'll she'll say, like,
3888920	3892440	oh, let's just have those people discussion in order to snag someone like me or Laci Green to
3892440	3897560	get on the debate. But then she goes back to her videos where, like, is there really there's no
3897560	3903560	actual like, there's no I've watched so many Blair White videos. I'm I'm so sorry for myself. I but
3903560	3910040	she she she does these like thing. I mean, is there ever a moment when she makes a video response
3910040	3915320	to Milo Stewart or to Riley Dennis, where there's ever an attempt at a genuine like human connection
3915320	3920520	or a genuine discussion in any way with the person she's talking to? Like there just never is.
3921000	3924200	I remember hearing about Milo Stewart through your video on them. Actually,
3924200	3931160	do people still people still bully them? Um, yeah, it's not as bad as it used to be. But
3931160	3936120	yeah, they tend to stay away from a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's channels.
3938120	3942040	Not where you're not losing anything. You're not missing out. Yeah. If you're avoiding these
3942040	3947800	bullying channels. Yeah. Just for you and PBS ID channel and a few others. Sean and
3947800	3954200	Jennifer cooking. Yes. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of channels not worth watching. I mean,
3954200	3959240	bearing my god, like this. I don't know if you know who this guy is. He's unfortunately,
3959240	3964120	he's it's a kind of like bullying shitty response channel. Huge, like 300,000 subscribers.
3965560	3971080	But he, I mean, so he did a response to my debate with Roman millennial where he what he did was
3971800	3976280	show clips of me and he deleted every single thing I said, except every time I say the word I think
3976280	3983000	and to me, and then he calls me a cunt and then you know, so okay, wow, like, and so you know,
3983000	3987240	my advice to all feminists and social justice YouTubers in terms of dealing with bearing
3987240	3993560	is do not interact with him except as an actual brown bear, because this is the level that you're
3993560	3998520	dealing with. Like there's no point in engaging this. Like this is a bear in the woods to say,
3998520	4002120	you leave a comment saying hi bearing your big brown bear and then leave don't watch the video
4002520	4007640	because there's no point like that. If someone's if, like I said, discussion is a two way road.
4007640	4012520	And if one person is not making good faith effort to discuss, don't you don't you there's no reason
4012520	4018360	for you to open yourself up. That's a waste of your time. Yeah, yeah. That's a shame that people
4018360	4024520	do that. Yeah, it's well YouTube is. I guess it's it's rewarded. YouTube is a shame. Yes,
4024520	4028760	I think yes, that slogan actually, it's not a corporate slogan. YouTube a shameful place.
4028760	4031880	Yeah, I think that's the last time I went to YouTube Space London and that was on the side
4031880	4042760	of the building. Yeah. A shameful place. I quite like that on a t shirt. Yeah, but I guess I don't
4042760	4047400	know. Like I say, I think there really are a lot of people on YouTube worth engaging. So it's not
4047400	4050600	a matter of me being against debate. I'm not against debate. I'm not against engagement.
4050600	4055640	I simply think and this is what this is the advice people gave me. And I didn't listen to it. I had
4055640	4061240	to learn it. I'm still learning it. But I have to I just I'm just someone like, I'm not a smart
4061240	4064520	person in the sense that I just believe people when they tell me things like I have to make all
4064520	4071800	every mistake myself like to play. I just I guess maybe it's a kind of I'm so such a rational
4071800	4077880	skeptic. I don't believe personal testimony. Every single mistake I must make on my own in order to
4077880	4082200	believe anyone about anything. So again, I had to I have to see for myself the liberals turn fascist.
4082200	4088440	I had to see for myself who isn't who is and isn't worth engaging in. And yeah, I'm still in
4088440	4093000	the process of it. So like I said, I'll probably do more debates that are mistakes. And that's just
4093000	4097800	part of making those mistakes. It's just part of my learning how to do this. I think sometimes
4098360	4102440	with debates, there's a little bit of um, there's a little bit of a kick who goes madman about it.
4102440	4107560	And I think I remember thinking this, I remember we really, really interested when I discovered
4107560	4112680	this story. So for those who may be watching who don't know, there's this fantastic story about
4112680	4118440	a lunatic who escapes from from an asylum. And he realizes that if he goes into town and just says
4118440	4122120	mad shit, then they're going to realize he's mad and they're going to send him back. So he's like,
4122120	4127880	ah, right. I will only say things that are uncontroversially true. And then nobody could
4127880	4131720	nobody's gonna lock me up for that. Like so he says, right. All I'm ever gonna say to anybody
4131720	4135560	is the world is round. So he goes into town and to every single person he meets like the world is
4135560	4137960	round, the world is round, the world is round, the world is round. That's all he says. And he's
4137960	4142440	right. Because it is. And they like pretty much immediately realizes realize that he's a madman
4142440	4147720	and they lock him up. And Kierkegaard told this story. And the point was, you can have all the
4147720	4153320	facts and all the truths and so on. And you can be like, technically true and correct, but still
4153320	4159960	wrong. If you've got the context wrong of why it matters. Walking around pubs saying the world is
4159960	4163960	round, everyone's gonna be like, what's wrong with you? Because yeah, you're right. But why?
4163960	4167800	Like, what are you saying? What's the act that's being performed here?
4168440	4172440	This is one of the things that you get out of studying philosophy, I think that like,
4173400	4177320	I miss them. So in a lot of ways, I hate interacting with other philosophy people,
4177320	4182040	not you, you're awesome. But like, a lot of academic philosophy people who are like,
4182040	4187320	especially like people who are like in the PhD route, you know, they get so involved in the
4187320	4191400	language of philosophy that they sort of lose the ability to communicate with a normal person,
4191400	4195000	because they've got this, this whole little technical way of doing it, which has some
4195000	4198920	advantages. But then when I go outside, and I talk to people with normal people, God, I suddenly wish
4198920	4204200	they knew philosophy of language. Because now, now there's this like, lack of distinction between,
4204200	4210440	you know, no one, I think very few people have this idea that just saying a fact is not enough,
4210440	4215960	like a fact is always presented as part of a bigger chain of reasons, or there's different
4215960	4219480	ways of stating facts. And right, you can state the fact the world is round. And if it's out of
4219480	4226360	context, it could be wrong, or it could be crazy. Right? Like, like, like, two and two makes what
4226360	4231480	the world is round. It's Yeah, wrong, wrong answer, like correct, but wrong. Or like,
4231480	4235240	in my video on on white supremacist propaganda, like, I was so pleased when I thought of this
4235240	4240920	example, and example, I love you, which which can be said, like 100 million different ways and
4241640	4246120	always be true and always mean the same thing, but do something so different to the person
4246120	4250760	hearing it every time. And, or another thing, another thing you get me with maybe the white
4250760	4255480	nationalist thing is you'll have people point out, like, here's a list of all the Jews involved in
4255480	4259720	the media and all the Jews involved in politics. And it's like, okay, yes, all those people are of
4259720	4264440	Jewish ancestry, and all of them are what you say. But like, so it's not that it's not a factual
4264440	4269160	dispute. It's the way it's what they're saying with it. Like how, of course, when you when you
4269160	4274040	point that out, they go, but I'm just listing the facts. Like, you're the one who's thinking that
4274040	4278040	just because I made a list of all the people who live in the neighborhood of this ancestry,
4278040	4283320	you're the real racists. Yes, it's well done. We can all do the Russian reversal.
4284120	4288200	And oftentimes, when you try to make these kinds of arguments, and this is again, the danger of
4288200	4292040	doing this on a public platform is I end up seeming like some kind of like, it's like the
4292040	4297000	sophistry of some fancy talking elitist by like, trying to like add this additional light, you know
4297000	4301560	what I mean? It seems like I seem like a weasel, or something for trying to get out and take
4301560	4306920	people's words and know what I'm going to do. But now that there's the tip of the iceberg,
4306920	4308200	and then there's everything else, like,
4309240	4312600	so again, you can imagine you can imagine having like a very an argument, a very belligerent
4312600	4317160	creationist, and the creationist wins the argument, because they, if you allow them
4317160	4321800	to lock you down with, so like, here's how this might go. Like, they'll say, like, can or cannot
4321800	4328120	a monkey give birth to a man? And you say, well, no, but and they say, aha. And like, you know,
4328680	4332760	but actually, these things are a gradual process over time, talking over time,
4332760	4337000	and like small genetic mutations. It's only over the course of millions of years. And he's like,
4337000	4343960	this fancy talking liberal thinks you should believe. He won't give a straightforward
4343960	4353000	answer to the question. And like, so there's ways of arguing that make sophistication seem
4353080	4361480	like deception. Yeah, yeah. That makes sort of crude fallacies seem like common sense.
4362680	4367480	Yeah, I suppose. There's something interesting in there about, just a half-form thought,
4367480	4372680	something interesting in there about education, and academia in particular being kind of gated
4372680	4376520	off to particular class interests. Traditionally, maybe there's something interesting in there,
4376520	4381800	but maybe that's another topic for another time. I'm happy to crack on with this and continue.
4382760	4386360	Can we have a tea break? Can I make tea? Will that be terribly boring for everyone?
4390840	4393080	Or are we, or is there anything more?
4396200	4399720	Sorry, do you want to say you want to continue the stream but make tea or do you want to
4399720	4402840	just call it? I had this time with me. I mean, yeah, I'm happy to keep talking.
4402840	4405880	All right, sure. I'll just talk to the chat while you do that.
4405880	4409400	It's either this or, you know, write an essay on Brecht, but I'll be pottering around in
4409480	4413320	the background making tea. All right, sounds good. Tea break.
4414520	4417640	It's the law, I'm afraid, in England. I can't go 90 minutes without tea.
4417640	4421000	Yeah, he has no choice. It's the law of England. All right, I'm gonna look at the chat.
4421000	4421800	How's everyone doing?
4425080	4428520	While he's doing well, you know what, while he's making tea, I'm gonna do a shot because
4428520	4429320	this is America.
4432840	4438440	Shots! Oh, God, I'm almost out of booze. That's gonna be a problem because I'm supposed to go
4438440	4448440	talk to Destiny later about transracialism. I'm noticing all of you. All right, let's see.
4449880	4453880	Evan Williams. A good American whiskey. It's actually a bad American whiskey,
4453880	4456200	but it's drinkable. It'll do. It'll do its work.
4458680	4460440	It'll be like three in the afternoon for you.
4462360	4465800	Yeah, it's three. It's almost four in the afternoon, but it's Sunday.
4466760	4468360	Well, it's nighttime here, so.
4470040	4475160	All right, well, I'm trying to think of a good toast. Someone proposed toast.
4479080	4482680	I was thinking of doing an ironic hail victory, but I think I should not do that.
4485160	4487320	An ironic Richard Spencer hail victory.
4487320	4487820	Oh, dear.
4489560	4494840	If I want people to take my... Let's not do that. You know what? Nazis are literally
4494840	4502920	ruining me. I find myself... Their thoughts just infect my head. They're terrible, ironic
4503720	4508920	Nazism. It affects me. Not that I believe any of it, but it's just there. It's there in my head.
4508920	4515000	I'm there trying to make breakfast or try taking a shower. I just find myself thinking about cucks
4515000	4518600	and thinking about cucking. It's just like, God damn it. I didn't used to think about this.
4518600	4520520	The alt-right has done this to me. They've put...
4520520	4523960	Yeah, and I find even in acting there's not a lot of escape because the three
4524040	4528280	plays that might end up being our showcase at the end of the year are all about Nazis and fascists.
4529880	4530840	Well, down with fascists.
4531800	4533960	Yeah, yes, down with fascists. Absolutely.
4535400	4537160	I say that without any irony whatsoever.
4538600	4542360	My man, I've not had whiskey in ages. I've not had whiskey since I lived in Scotland, actually.
4543240	4544280	Well, it's a good place for it.
4545080	4545880	Yeah, absolutely.
4547880	4550120	Evan Williams is not the smoothest of all whiskeys, I must say.
4551320	4553160	Are you a single malt or a blended person?
4554040	4557160	I'm a blended person for purely financial reasons.
4563800	4567640	Next time I do a Let's Play livestream, I think I'm going to start a whiskey fund
4567640	4570040	to raise some money for some decent whiskey.
4570760	4571640	Fair enough.
4571640	4574760	I think I'm relying on people who like whiskey to be evangelists.
4574760	4577480	Enough about good whiskey that they'll pay me to drink it.
4578440	4585640	This is one of the great things about whiskey people is that they're not satisfied with being
4585640	4589720	a whiskey person by themselves. They want everyone else to join them.
4589720	4593400	And so you can exploit this urge as a means of getting free whiskey.
4593960	4598680	Yeah, my friend John, the liquid guy on Twitter is a good whiskey drinker, I think.
4601560	4602600	Now I'm all teed up.
4603400	4605160	How is the chat? How is everyone?
4605160	4606200	They're doing just fine.
4606520	4607720	There's not a whole lot of Nazis here.
4607720	4612600	I must say, despite the common claim made by YouTube rationals that everyone has Nazis
4612600	4615160	in their chat, I'm not seeing a whole lot of it in my chat.
4615160	4619640	I wonder what it is that I do to keep the Nazis away.
4619640	4621560	Maybe it's not constantly sympathized with them.
4623880	4630760	Is it Ollie or Ollie, says workers of O-L-L-Y, if you prefer.
4630760	4631320	That'd be nice.
4631320	4635000	I remember I used to go by Oliver, which is my real name, but my first ever girlfriend
4635000	4637560	told me that Ollie with a Y was cuter, and I've been Ollie ever since.
4638200	4642920	Although my professional name is Oliver on acting credits, so I don't mind really.
4643960	4645080	Oh yeah, Le Pen lost.
4645080	4647400	I really should have been toasting to pen losing.
4647400	4648440	Well, I guess I did.
4648440	4649640	Down with fascists, yeah.
4649640	4650280	Down with fascists.
4650280	4651480	Down with fascists.
4653560	4654680	Oh, that's relaxing, isn't it?
4655560	4656280	What, whiskey?
4656840	4657960	Oh no, Le Pen losing.
4657960	4658760	I mean, also whiskey, but...
4660040	4661240	Oh yeah, I guess, yeah.
4661240	4663080	I really don't know much about Macron, so...
4663880	4668920	Yeah, he's not like a super great politician, but like my bar has sunk very low.
4670040	4671800	Yeah, it could be worse.
4671800	4672920	It could be worse, I guess, yeah.
4672920	4678840	My French friend will be relieved, I'm sure, who makes fun of my terrible French.
4679880	4682440	I spoke French in a video a while ago, and a few of my commenters were like,
4682440	4683400	oh, that's really great.
4683400	4685000	And then my French friend was like,
4685640	4688840	you sound like an English soldier trying to chat up a French country maid.
4690680	4691880	It's like, wow, how very specific.
4692520	4695480	Yeah, that's an interesting thing for your mind to go to first.
4698360	4699880	People are super chatting me to do another shot.
4699880	4702840	I will do, because you did that, I will do one more shot before the chat is over,
4702840	4704120	but I'm going to keep my composure.
4706520	4708200	Oh man, I wish I could have some.
4708200	4708760	That'd be great.
4708760	4713080	Well, that technology is not yet upon us, but someday.
4713800	4714680	Someday.
4714680	4715480	I'll stick with the tea.
4716520	4718200	I don't even have any booze in my whole flat.
4718920	4719420	Wow.
4720300	4720700	That's all right.
4720700	4723500	I woke up with a stinking thing over this morning, so I can do.
4725260	4729500	I had to go to a sword fighting lesson today,
4729500	4731180	which is the kind of thing you've got to do when you're an actor.
4736220	4737900	It's like, oh, please slip and kill me.
4738700	4740460	Can you please upload sword fighting videos?
4741580	4742700	Oh, oh, maybe.
4743900	4746860	They'd be very dull, it's all very slow motion, yeah.
4746860	4747420	Oh, I don't know.
4747500	4751740	There's a lot of great European martial arts and
4751740	4754380	European historical sword fighting channels on YouTube.
4755980	4758460	Now, this is another topic that many of these channels
4758460	4762220	also have just the slightest tinge of neo-fascism about them.
4763740	4768540	Yeah, who was the guy you used to make videos about who kind of played Skyrim?
4769500	4770300	The Golden One.
4771420	4771920	Yeah.
4772460	4773740	What was that about?
4773740	4775820	Oh, Tom to the glory of Evan Williams, yes.
4775820	4776620	Yeah, The Golden One.
4776620	4778140	So he's a fascinating character.
4778140	4783740	He's a Swedish bodybuilder who kind of does this larping Skyrim thing,
4783740	4788300	where he uploads himself playing Skyrim with his commentary,
4788300	4789420	and his commentary is gold.
4789420	4793660	I mean, of all the fascists, The Golden One is my favorite.
4793660	4795020	I mean, he's actually entertaining.
4796460	4800780	I never thought I'd say this, but it makes me feel weird inside,
4800780	4804220	because I'm like, this man believes things that I think are monstrous,
4804220	4807020	and yet I'm having a great time watching his YouTube videos.
4808460	4811180	I feel like it makes me feel so conflicted and weird.
4811180	4815660	But he's also given me the idea to play my own cock version of Skyrim.
4817100	4820780	I guess it's a kind of penitence for enjoying his fascist videos.
4824140	4825260	Skyrim, that's great.
4825980	4826780	I love that idea.
4827340	4828140	Oh, what's that?
4828140	4828940	You've got one video.
4829500	4830540	I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
4831340	4831840	Hmm.
4832940	4835020	I remember right back when I started,
4835020	4839340	I did a Let's Play series of a philosophy game called Socrates Jones,
4839340	4840140	which was quite fun.
4840780	4841340	Oh my gosh.
4841340	4842540	I haven't done any Let's Plays since.
4843420	4845180	It seems like everyone does them, so.
4845180	4845680	Yeah.
4847020	4849500	I'm an absolute noob when it comes to Let's Plays,
4849500	4851740	but I'm streaming Pokemon on my live stream channel.
4851740	4853340	I made a separate channel, by the way, guys,
4853340	4855020	if you want to check it out for live streams.
4855740	4856860	This is on my main channel, of course,
4856860	4859980	because I think this is a stream,
4859980	4862220	which until recently had some serious intellectual merit.
4862220	4864620	But I think that my live stream channel,
4864620	4867900	I want to, I just want a channel that I can just post whatever frivolous,
4867900	4869820	horrible nonsense that comes to my head.
4869820	4871980	And so without offending my usual subscribers,
4871980	4872780	so that's the point of that.
4873340	4874380	Yeah, I should do that as well.
4874380	4877340	I think this is somewhere I might start a second channel for my acting.
4877340	4877980	It's a lot of fun.
4878700	4879200	Yeah.
4880060	4884540	I think when a YouTuber builds up a certain fan,
4884620	4886940	you know, a fan base of a certain size,
4886940	4890300	you sort of feel this like intense pressure before you upload anything,
4890300	4891980	because you're like, oh, I don't want to disappoint people.
4891980	4893740	This has to be up to my standards of quality.
4894380	4896620	And so it's a great liberation to just make a new channel and be like,
4896620	4897980	oh, I can do whatever I want.
4899500	4900780	Yeah, I don't experience that.
4900780	4902140	But then I'm quite shit, so.
4903500	4904540	Well, I don't think you're that shit.
4905260	4908460	I think your videos are actually pretty well produced and thought out.
4908460	4910460	And I think you have more subscribers than I do.
4910460	4911500	I mean, I think that.
4911500	4914860	Not for long.
4916380	4917020	Well, I don't know.
4917020	4917520	We'll see.
4920140	4924220	But yeah, it's psychologically good for me to have a channel where I'm like,
4924220	4926300	I don't care if I don't care what happened from this channel.
4927660	4928160	Yeah.
4929980	4933020	Yeah, I kind of have to fit it around drama school,
4933020	4935900	which is like half five in the morning till sort of six at night every day.
4935900	4938460	So this is like the school is like a full time thing for you now.
4938460	4938960	Yeah.
4939760	4940160	Yeah, yeah.
4940160	4943200	I graduate in September and then I'll be I'll be an actor living in London.
4943200	4943700	Wow.
4943700	4944720	Living the dream.
4944720	4946000	Amazing thing.
4946000	4948320	That's why I'm kind of learning to swing swords and
4948880	4954160	ride horses and all the rest of it, because which is a lot of investment and time.
4954160	4958400	But my casting is Shakespeare and period dramas.
4959280	4961280	And doing that on TV would be great.
4961280	4962960	But if I can't swing a sword and ride a horse,
4962960	4965840	then all I'm going to be doing is opening the door to the character and saying that.
4965840	4967200	And that'll be my only role.
4967200	4968720	Whereas if I can ride the horse and swing the sword,
4968720	4970240	then I can be Henry the fifth, you know?
4970240	4970740	Yes.
4971120	4972000	Well, I think you'd be great.
4972800	4973280	Oh, thank you.
4973280	4974080	It's not just the beard.
4975760	4976480	Thank you very much.
4977840	4980960	So you're interested in TV or stage or both?
4980960	4981360	Anything.
4981360	4983200	I'll do any of it because I love it all so much.
4984320	4987600	Yeah, I've acted since I was very little and I would do anything they would let me do.
4990080	4990580	Yeah.
4990580	4990880	What about you?
4990880	4992720	You're YouTube full time now, aren't you?
4992720	4994320	Yeah, this is this is it.
4994320	4996720	This is all I'm doing is YouTube every day, all day.
4997280	4999200	That's funny.
4999200	5000000	It's amazing.
5000800	5001280	I love it.
5001840	5004160	I wouldn't trade it for anything else.
5004160	5006000	It's a lot of Nazis though.
5006000	5007840	But it's a lot of Nazis, granted.
5007840	5009840	More Nazis than most jobs.
5009840	5013840	I mean, I'm working at least I'm working harder than I was when I was a PhD student.
5014640	5016240	But I'm more happy than I was.
5017440	5018000	That's great.
5019840	5023440	So I mean, what I would say to people who want to be full time YouTubers is
5024320	5028160	get ready to work like a corporate lawyer in terms of the hours you're putting in.
5028160	5030160	It's so much more fun than being a corporate lawyer.
5030160	5031600	So there's that advantage.
5031600	5034000	But also, like, anything that you do.
5034000	5038000	This is something I realized, like, I made some money, some actual money last weekend
5038000	5038880	streaming Pokemon.
5038880	5041760	And I was like, huh, maybe I could be one of these professional video game streamers.
5042400	5046640	But the thing is that, like, anything that's work becomes work.
5046640	5049680	Like, and those guys, I say guys, because they're just mostly guys.
5049680	5050960	They're women who do it, too.
5051360	5057360	But those guys who are professional streamers, they're doing like, 11 hours a day of this
5057360	5057680	stuff.
5057680	5061360	And I mean, you know, okay, so they're playing video games for a living.
5061360	5063280	I'm sure they love it and wouldn't trade it for anything.
5063280	5067280	But there's got to be days where they're like, I don't feel like playing Call of Duty today,
5067280	5069120	but I have to to pay the gas bill.
5069120	5071280	And I just play Scrabble once in a while.
5071280	5071920	Yeah.
5071920	5073440	Just long for reading.
5074160	5075840	Yes, yes, exactly.
5075840	5076800	I kind of long for reading.
5076800	5078560	I don't get to read that much anymore.
5078560	5083520	Because, yeah, I just don't have time.
5084720	5085120	Yeah.
5085120	5089440	I mean, I'm very lucky that the fans sometimes buy me books from my Amazon Wishlist.
5090000	5092080	I have a big pile of them stacked up at the moment.
5092080	5095840	I suppose I don't have much time to read because drama school is getting very intense in the
5095840	5096400	final term.
5096400	5101520	But yeah, I'm reading and you, in fact, you, the laptop are currently stacked on top of
5101520	5102320	a few books.
5102320	5106320	One of which is Marjorie Garber's, what is it?
5106320	5109360	Vested Interests, which is all right.
5109360	5110160	It's kind of slow going.
5110160	5115520	I'm reading that and I'm also reading, I got it for my birthday, Vladimir Nabokov's Arda,
5115520	5117200	which is good, but it's kind of long.
5119040	5121360	So it's slow going, but then I have a little long tube journey.
5122560	5123060	Yeah.
5124080	5128000	The year before I started doing this channel, I was trying to, my initial idea was I was
5128000	5128720	going to write fiction.
5128720	5130640	That was what I thought I wanted to do when I left grad school.
5130640	5131280	That's great.
5131280	5132320	And yeah, great.
5132320	5136160	But it's not like, man, if you want that as a career, like, God help you.
5136800	5139280	Yeah, it's very difficult.
5139280	5145440	I eventually gave up on it, but I was reading so much because I was just doing jobs to get
5145440	5145600	by.
5145600	5149760	So I was an Uber driver in Baltimore, also horrible, horrible job, never do it.
5151760	5153360	I was like a copy editor.
5154080	5159760	I taught a couple of classes, but I, you know, just worked enough to pay the rent and I had
5159760	5160800	a ton of time to read.
5160800	5162320	So I read all these classic novels.
5162320	5163120	I read Moby Dick.
5163120	5164000	I read Middlemarch.
5164000	5168320	I read just things that I will never, I'll probably never have a year of my life that
5168320	5172480	has so much ambitious reading in it starting now, which in some ways is too bad because
5172480	5176480	I feel like reading all this stuff, it does, like, it expands your mind.
5176480	5177600	It's actually good for you.
5179600	5180720	I missed reading fiction.
5180720	5184160	I don't get to read, I don't really love fiction, which is why this person got me harder and
5185200	5188160	why I'm working my way through 20,000 weeks under the sea as well.
5188800	5189300	Yeah.
5189680	5189840	Yeah.
5189840	5191120	I miss reading fiction.
5191280	5191780	Yeah.
5194080	5194720	I'd like to do it.
5194720	5198560	I just, I mean, I guess I could, I could make time if I really wanted to.
5198560	5199760	It would be less tweeting.
5199760	5201120	Tweeting is the thing that's got to go.
5201120	5202480	I spent so much time tweeting.
5202480	5202720	Yeah.
5202720	5204560	I deleted Twitter off my phone a while ago.
5204560	5205120	Yeah.
5205120	5206800	And it's the future.
5206800	5207760	It's amazing.
5207760	5208240	Yeah.
5208240	5210960	I've still got it on my laptop, so I can do all the kind of tweeting I need to do for
5210960	5211440	the channel.
5211440	5213680	But yeah, I got rid of it on my phone.
5213680	5217120	I'm like, oh, I can see birds.
5217120	5217680	It's amazing.
5218240	5218740	Yeah.
5219280	5219780	Yeah.
5219780	5225040	We had a thing on the course called living history where we go and we live in the 17th
5225040	5230960	century in character for a week, basically, but obviously no Twitter.
5230960	5234960	And everyone came back from that and was like, yeah, I'm deleting all this social media off
5234960	5235440	my phone.
5235440	5237360	And I was like, yeah, we're doing that too.
5237360	5237860	It was good.
5238480	5239520	Very good detox.
5240160	5243680	Someday I may well have to hit you up to do some Shakespearean stuff on my channel.
5244320	5245680	Oh, please, please do.
5245680	5246720	I would love to.
5246800	5249120	Yeah, I think that'd be a lot of fun.
5249120	5253440	I used to have a second channel called Shakespeare Vlogs where I would vlog in character of Shakespeare.
5253440	5254320	Oh my gosh.
5254320	5257520	And it would start off as Hamlet being like, oh, I'm really sad about my day and blah,
5257520	5257840	blah, blah.
5257840	5259440	But then it would go into reverse.
5260240	5261280	Why is this not in my life?
5262000	5266160	I'm probably going to bring it back once I stopped it just before I started my training
5266160	5268640	because I thought, okay, I'm getting better, but I might get into bad habits if I don't
5268640	5269360	have any guidance.
5269360	5272960	So I think over the summer, hopefully, hopefully, and now that I've said it on the live stream,
5272960	5273920	of course, people will hold me to it.
5273920	5277840	Hopefully, over the summer, I'd like to bring that back under some kind of guise because
5277840	5278560	that was a lot of fun.
5278560	5283360	And it's all practice towards the acting as well, which is good.
5283360	5284080	It's good stuff.
5284080	5284480	But yeah.
5285280	5286560	Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
5286560	5288960	I think that I can definitely imagine there being an audience for it.
5288960	5292720	One thing that's fascinating is even though people, I feel, don't read that much these
5292720	5296080	days, fiction is kind of pretty marginal as an art form.
5297040	5301120	You know, this is something I noticed when I was trying to write and read it is that
5301120	5306640	contemporary fiction is a very specialized area where I think most people are sort of
5306640	5307840	not plugged into it.
5307840	5310640	But people love Shakespeare still.
5311440	5312080	They just love it.
5312960	5314320	And I'm not sure why exactly.
5314320	5317280	I mean, obviously, it's great, but lots of things are great, and people don't love those
5317280	5317680	things.
5317680	5319360	You know, but people love Shakespeare.
5320400	5322320	Yeah, it's beautiful.
5325760	5326640	Milton is beautiful.
5326640	5327680	People don't love Milton.
5327680	5328560	That's true.
5328560	5329040	That's true.
5329920	5332000	I would love Shakespeare because I'm an actor.
5332000	5333840	I have so many brilliant roles in it.
5333840	5335760	And yeah, I could go on for hours.
5337200	5337680	But yeah.
5337680	5339840	No, I would like to do a Shakespearean channel.
5339840	5342880	And if you ever need any Shakespeare, let me know.
5342880	5344480	I almost definitely will need some Shakespeare.
5346320	5346960	Oh, I'd love to.
5349120	5350000	Super duper.
5350000	5350240	Right.
5350240	5353680	Well then, I suppose I really should write this essay on Brecht.
5353680	5354000	All right.
5354000	5354320	All right.
5354960	5356480	Well, you can go write the essay on Brecht.
5357360	5359600	Because someone superchatted me to do a shot.
5359600	5361040	I'll do one more shot.
5361040	5362960	Oh, I don't really have to.
5362960	5364240	I just wanted to get you drunk faster.
5365440	5366240	That's what it is.
5366240	5371200	And then check out my Twitter later if you want to see my thing on Destiny.
5371200	5374240	I'm going to go think about what I'm going to say to try to talk him out of this nonsense.
5375520	5376240	What is it?
5376240	5378000	Or maybe he'll, I don't know, maybe he'll talk me into it.
5378000	5378640	I don't know.
5378640	5380400	But so it's Destiny.
5380400	5382080	He's a professional streamer.
5382080	5387920	He's a really interesting streamer because he, I like Destiny because he's a guy who
5387920	5392080	he tells the story of having been quite a bit of a shitlord a few years ago.
5392720	5397360	And he's since sort of backed out of those positions.
5397360	5401120	And that's an intensely attractive thing to me because it makes me feel like I'm not wasting
5401120	5402080	my goddamn time.
5402080	5406880	And also, I feel like to some extent I've moved in the same direction over the last
5406880	5407520	several years.
5408960	5411120	So I tend to hit it off really well with him.
5411120	5417360	But he wants to make the philosophical case that there's a good analog between transracialism
5417360	5425120	and transgenderism, which is something that is extremely frowned upon in social justice
5425120	5425920	circles.
5425920	5431520	So I'm going to go and talk to him about it.
5435840	5437200	But anyway, thank you.
5437200	5439760	Oh, I guess I'll do my shot now.
5440400	5441120	Oh, yeah, go for it.
5441120	5442880	Yeah, down with fascism, down with a pen.
5443760	5444560	Down with fascism.
5447760	5448560	What a drink.
5451840	5455680	Well, on that note, thank you all for tuning in.
5456240	5458800	And Oli, thank you so much for...
5458800	5460800	God damn it, there's a kangaroo in this stream.
5460800	5462560	Thank you, Oli, so much.
5463280	5463840	My pleasure.
5463840	5464880	Thank you so much for having me.
5464880	5465760	It's been lovely.
5465760	5467200	Yes, we'll have to do this again sometime.
5467840	5469040	All right.
5469040	5470480	Thanks, everyone, for watching.
5470480	5471360	Bye, everyone.
5471360	5474160	Bye.
