00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello, and welcome to my first ever attempt at broadcasting a live debate. Fittingly,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,840
the topic is, is it worthwhile to broadcast live debates? And my guest is Ollie, one of

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,080
my favorite YouTubers who runs a channel called Philosophy Tube. Link is in the description,

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,880
please go check it out. And Ollie, you want to introduce yourself?

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,400
Well, yeah, thank you very much for having me on, Nick. As you say, I run a channel called

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Philosophy Tube. I do like a 10 minute or so video every week teaching philosophy. When

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,080
the British government tripled tuition fees, I decided I'd give away my degree for free

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,160
online. So that's what I do. And I'm a long time follower of your work as well, an admirer of it.

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,920
Thank you. Yeah, it's funny that you say give away your work for free, because in a sense,

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
that's also the way I think of what I do, is that I feel that I've been given this kind of

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,040
gift of an education from society. And I do feel some obligation to just like, give it out for

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,760
free. Because one of the frustrations I think of being in university is how elitist it is and how

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,040
much money you have to pay to get access to that information. But anyway, so we're talking about

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,440
whether debate is worthwhile. So I thought I'd start just by saying a little bit about why this

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:27,600
topic seems like it needs to be discussed. So I think debate is something that has kind of this

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,640
important role in our discourse. We think of it as this cornerstone of democracy. It's something

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,800
that we hold up as a way of finding out what is true. But I think in most of our personal

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,960
experiences, we know that that's not always the case. Debate seems to have this element of

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,280
performance. It seems to often rely on things like people's personal appearance and how likable a

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,220
person is, things that have nothing to do with what is true or who's correct. So the question

21
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:04,000
that's raised is debate as important as we say it is. And it's something that I've been asking

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,640
myself recently as I've been doing debates and discussions with conservatives or far-right people

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
on YouTube. And a lot of people on the left have kind of questioned whether I'm smart to do that.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,400
And the criticism ranges from minor criticism, like you're putting yourself through a lot of

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,960
emotional agony for the sake of little benefit, to outright you're doing the wrong thing. You're

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:32,120
giving a platform to people who shouldn't have a platform. Stop doing this. So I don't know. Do

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,240
you come to this with a position that you hold in general on the utility of debate?

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't know. I mean, I come to it with a little bit of personal experience. So I, at my uni,

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,880
we were talking about elite institutions, there was a fairly high-flying debate society that I

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,480
went along to occasionally, and didn't really find it a massively useful use of my Wednesday

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,800
nights. I did win a prize there once, because I deliberately gave a speech that contained an

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,160
argument that I knew didn't work. And then they gave me the prize for that speech. And I was like,

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,160
probably not going to come anymore, guys. So it was fun. But I don't know, it's interesting. I mean,

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,480
the kicker is, is it the way to truth? And I'm not sure it always is. It can be, certainly. But

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,680
yeah, I don't think it is always the way to truth for the reasons that you mentioned, because it is

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,640
kind of, it can become a grandstanding thing. People can sort of play to the audience a bit

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,000
too much. And it can be influenced by things that people have, sort of, that aren't really

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,480
relevant to the points, like dress and so on, and likeability and charisma. And so, yeah, I'd

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,600
certainly, I mean, if the question is, is it important? I'd say, yeah, yeah, it depends what

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,800
you mean by important. It's very important in some senses. But is it the way to truth always,

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:57,280
necessarily? I'm inclined to think maybe not. But I don't know. Maybe, yeah, I'm kind of,

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,480
because this is something I'm wondering about at the moment, rather than coming at it directly with

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,040
a point I want to argue. I'm living the question, as we say in acting. Because, yeah.

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,200
So hang on one second, I'm gonna respond to that. I feel that I may have somehow the

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,400
permalink to this debate may have gotten public because a couple people have suddenly added into

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,760
this Google Hangout. So I'm gonna make sure that I didn't tweet that link or something stupid like

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,480
that. Did I? Was that me? Oh, yeah, maybe it was you. Oops. You might want to delete that tweet.

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think, okay, hopefully we're good. Otherwise,

49
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,360
we're gonna be inviting random people. Well, which could also be interesting. We can debate

50
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,320
them. But anyway, yeah, so I think bringing up the formal debate society is like, that is kind

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,640
of an important point to raise. Because when you have formal debates, people are often assigned

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,040
which position of the debate to take. So I know when the high school debate teams and so on,

53
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,920
you win by being the most persuasive. But of course, people don't choose what they're arguing.

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,520
So there's a kind of culture that revolves around debate societies or around a professional debate

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,240
that involves simply having the greatest rhetoric, not being true. So, I mean,

56
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,760
Classes and so on will sort of have classes in providing sample arguments rather than saying,

57
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,320
you find out whether or not you're correct. It's kind of, the classes are given in light,

58
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,360
as you say, in the rhetoric. And that's kind of weird and interesting. And the fact that,

59
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
and how do you measure how persuasive someone is? How do you do that without,

60
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,040
I mean, you have to have like a control group, like a blank audience who know nothing about

61
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,520
anything. And then it's kind of sent in and it's like, who do you agree with? I don't know,

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,920
the guy in the red tie, I don't know. So how do you measure how persuasive someone is?

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,440
I've actually never been involved in a formal debate team, like in that kind of competitive

64
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,600
environment or competitive debate. What my understanding of the way that works is,

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,640
they have judges and judges evaluate arguments. I assume that those evaluations include things

66
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,880
like checking for logical fallacies and things like that, so that the guidelines would include

67
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,800
that the reasoning is sound. But if, I mean, this is not how, for instance, a presidential debate

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,480
in the US on CNN gets judged. In fact, in the last few presidential elections, they've,

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,040
I don't know if they do this in the UK too, but in the televised coverage of the debates,

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,040
they'll include this feature where it sort of shows the audience reaction, like in live time.

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,240
So you'll have like, it's like a line graph that's plotted by like how much people agree or

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,360
disagree with what the person is saying. Right, right. So if someone starts saying like,

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,080
like, hooray for the troops, like I support the troops, the line graph starts going up and up and

74
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,760
up. And if they start saying like, I don't know, no politician would say this, but if they say,

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,120
just because you give someone a gun doesn't make them a hero. The graph bottoms out,

76
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,040
everyone hates them. But this purely empirical way of evaluating debate, but both based on

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:15,240
public perception, that seems like a real problem. Because, I mean, the famous instance in the US is

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,320
this JFK-Nixon debate, or the first debate where Nixon was like sweaty and not very appealing to

79
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,480
the TV audience. And JFK obviously is this handsome presidential charismatic figure. And so

80
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,240
the perception is very much of the JFP is more presidential and more, you know, so it's

81
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,160
there's a performance art to it. And some of it does have to do with the way you look and so on.

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,920
But it's maybe a useful performance, right? I mean, it's in a way, any kind of rhetoric

83
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,600
sometimes can go beyond, rhetoric can be evaluated independently of how true the rhetoric,

84
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,240
independent of the truth of what's being said. So, but you wouldn't want to say that don't have

85
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,240
good rhetoric, because it doesn't have to do with truth. So debating still might be a skill worth

86
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,000
cultivating. Oh, absolutely. And certainly, I've found, like, in acting, this was like what I do,

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm an actor now. It's that the kind of experience I have of debating in formal debates was very

88
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,480
useful. And yeah, you're right, just because it's there's a sort of performance element to it

89
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,920
doesn't mean that it's not important. And that's kind of what I was into earlier on. And yeah,

90
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,080
it is interesting. I mean, one of the one of the things that's going on in the UK right now is that

91
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,600
we're about to have an election and then the current Prime Minister is not going to be

92
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,840
debating the leader of the main opposition party, Theresa May. She won't debate Jeremy Corbyn,

93
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,240
probably says what she says right now. And that, yeah, that's kind of very interesting.

94
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,440
I was like, why not? And everyone's wondering why she isn't. And some people are saying it's

95
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,440
because she's like, doesn't want to do like the Nixon thing of like, appearing to be a sort of

96
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,080
haunted mannequin. But you know, who knows? And yeah, it's very interesting.

97
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Yeah, so I say when there's there's also something special that happens when someone refuses to

98
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,960
debate or they don't debate, this is usually taken to be like a sign that you Oh, like you,

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,120
your ideas won't hold up. Yeah, I get Yeah, I imagine you get that a lot.

100
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,920
I mean, I get it. Maybe less than other people get it, because I have a couple of times

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,600
shown up to do these debates. But I also think that there are legitimate reasons to not want

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,920
to debate and there are people who shouldn't be debated. So I think there's something to be said

103
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,800
for not debating, for instance, Milo Yiannopoulos. And I know that this is something that I'm

104
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,320
thinking of an article, this well known article by the feminists, Penny read about not debating

105
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:56,280
Milo, because he is someone who I think most of us think he doesn't really care. He's not interested

106
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,320
in what's true. He's a kind of performance artist. And if you're debating someone like that,

107
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,480
there's part of you that thinks that you've lost if you even show up, because you can't.

108
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,280
This idea of good faith comes up a lot to me too. For instance, as a criticism of my debating Blair

109
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,960
White, that there's a notion that she's someone who's not really willing to kind of meet halfway.

110
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Or not necessarily meet halfway, but who's sort of not interested in

111
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,400
pursuing the truth in some sense. So there's some kind of performance art to it that goes beyond

112
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,560
that. So I think I retract saying meet halfway, because I think meet halfway is kind of a bullshit

113
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,240
thing to expect people to do, especially when you're debating people on the way far right.

114
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,920
You don't want to meet halfway on that. But I think that you use the term rap battle

115
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:57,000
to describe one way of thinking of debate as a kind of performance art. And this is something

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,720
I see on YouTube too, the idea of debate as this kind of like, pwnage contest.

117
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,880
Yeah, I mean, I remember that you had that video, you had a video, it was really good. I forget

118
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,720
which one it was actually, but like, we were like, oh, he came in and like tore you apart,

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,520
like went in Socrates and you have panties and so on. It's just like, what is that really?

120
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,240
Is that really the path to truth? Or is it? I've quite been, there's a channel I've been

121
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,360
watching recently, Sean and Jen. I've quite been enjoying Sean and Jen's videos recently. I put it

122
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,400
on while I'm cooking just because I really enjoy Sean's voice. It's a great channel.

123
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,280
Yeah, yeah. And I have to confess, I don't go and watch the videos that Sean's,

124
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,360
Sean admirably says go and watch the videos to make sure I'm not misrepresenting. I do actually

125
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,680
just listen to Sean and Jen because I like Sean's voice. And I put it on while I'm cooking. So I

126
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,280
guess there's even a performative aspect to somebody like that, sort of trying to engage

127
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,440
in this debate. And then maybe it's, I'm just kind of refusing to take it as what it's meant to be.

128
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,280
Yeah, that is kind of interesting. Yeah. So I think like a debate in particular,

129
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,480
so the goal, I guess, what is the goal of debate? I mean, it's not really to persuade the other

130
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,280
person. I don't think that this is a big mistake to think that that's the goal of a debate. So

131
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,760
sometimes people criticize me for doing debates by saying, oh, don't argue with this person. Like,

132
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,640
they'll never persuade them. Well, of course someone persuade them. It's for the sake of

133
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,400
the audience. And so I think that I heard someone's, I forget who, I think this was just

134
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,920
like a random YouTube comment or something I saw. They said that the only thing debate can

135
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,680
accomplish is to make sure that two people aren't straw manning each other. And I think there's some

136
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,320
truth to that. It's sort of what you're doing when you have a debate with someone some of the

137
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,640
time is you're saying, it sounds to me like you're saying this thing that I think is horrible. And

138
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,320
then they say either, yeah, that is what I'm saying, but that's not horrible. Or they say,

139
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,040
no, you've misunderstood me. So in a sense, one of the things debate accomplishes is it sort of,

140
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,720
it helps, it gives people a chance to say that a straw man version of their claim isn't what

141
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,640
their claim is. I suppose, yeah. That might be a good use of it. I quite like that.

142
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,080
I remember somebody said something very intelligent to me this morning when I was

143
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,960
telling them about what I was going to be doing this tonight. They said,

144
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,440
it's quite odd that people would, because I'm sure you get commenters as I do, like demanding

145
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,040
debate saying, oh, this must be debated. Or once you say, you've said this, other YouTubers said

146
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,520
this, you should debate them. And this person said to me this morning, those comments are very

147
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,960
interesting because an intelligent person could infer debate. Like if I'm claiming X and somebody

148
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,440
else is claiming Y, then it's like, well, as long as we understand both claims, then we understand

149
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,760
that there's a debate there. It doesn't need necessarily to be this performative clash,

150
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,320
like tonight at eight, that's a royal rumble between, yeah. It's just kind of not really

151
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,960
required. So, right. This is like definitely a kind of philosophy way of thinking about things

152
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,240
too, is that you should, if you're good, be able to build up an argument based on what you know

153
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,560
two people to say, and you should be able to build, you could sort of an imaginative argument

154
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,960
between two people. And I sort of try to do that in some of, I do some videos where I will do a

155
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,440
kind of dialogue, like I did this Nazi punching video, where I had two sides, each of which I

156
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,480
thought had something of value to say. And I kind of tried to, instead of having an actual debate

157
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,000
about it, just I made a fictional one, where I sort of tried to imagine what, how the two ideas

158
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,720
of a person will clash. And anyone should be able to do this, if you know enough about the side that

159
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,400
you're saying. And some ways that maybe, yeah. And some ways that maybe, go ahead, go ahead.

160
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,800
I said, I suppose the risk of doing yourself and playing both roles, although I kind of as an actor

161
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,800
really appreciate the kind of theatricality of that, I suppose the risk would be somebody saying,

162
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,560
ah, but if it's just one person behind it, then you kind of, you're avoiding the straw manning

163
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,680
thing. So you might still be straw manning them. And I love the video.

164
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,480
The risk with that is you're then speaking for someone else, and so you're definitely a risk

165
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,800
of straw manning. But what you also can do is you can avoid this kind of tonight at nine,

166
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,680
clash of personalities thing. And that is what, to me, one of the most discouraging things about

167
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,760
the way people respond to debates is that when I say, when I've posted that I'm going to have

168
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,440
a discussion with a roaming millennial or whoever I'm talking to on YouTube, a lot of people do

169
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,600
respond with popcorn eating gifts and like, you get the sense that like, oh, they just want to

170
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,400
see this like shit show, go down. Because to avoid the kind of tonight at nine,

171
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,960
clash thing, it's like, well, that's just pints. Like, just go for pints, like, or just do this,

172
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:40,760
just have this. Like, it's just a chat. It doesn't need to be sponsored by whoever.

173
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,400
Just go have pints. Like, it's fine. But then there are plenty of people I wouldn't want to

174
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,760
have pints with. And I've had plenty of pints with people where it's gotten pretty heated. So

175
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:56,280
yeah. So I think that I love the idea of it being pints. I mean, I think that's not,

176
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,600
I think that's actually sort of the difference between discussion and debate. And I think on

177
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,680
YouTube, although actually, the debate society at my uni were pretty heavy drinkers as well.

178
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,680
When I was at Georgetown, there was something called the Philodemic Society, which was like

179
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,080
a bunch of LARPing, bougie, pretentious people who wanted to roleplay that they were at Cambridge

180
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,840
in the 1950s. God, they sucked. But not all of them.

181
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,520
LARPing, bougie, Cambridge.

182
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,360
Yeah, it was awful. But yeah, there was also a lot of drinking.

183
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
A lot of people going, no!

184
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,880
A lot of people who just love just like wearing a suit and projecting their voice.

185
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh yeah, the debate society that was at my uni. It was suits and ties and gowns.

186
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,920
I used to go along, because they used to allow floor speeches at the end of the night.

187
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,440
So I was doing quite a lot of stand up comedy at the time. And I used to go along and just

188
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,760
do like five minutes of new material, just because I had a cast of audience who weren't allowed to,

189
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,640
like, they're not allowed to boo. They're only allowed to either say shame or resign.

190
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,760
And I'm like, that's inherently hilarious. So I used to go along and test out my material

191
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,480
and try and work it into the topic of it, just to mess with them. It's good fun.

192
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,560
Yeah, so but if a discussion is more worth having than debate, I think there's also,

193
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,880
maybe there's an issue that comes up a lot lately. Are there people not worth having

194
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,400
discussions with? I think the answer to this is clearly yes.

195
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,240
Especially in London, where it's five quid a pint. There are plenty of people.

196
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:40,760
Yeah, that's absolutely not worth it. But so I think that there has to, you know,

197
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,520
so to build a bridge, there has to be something to build a bridge to. There has to be

198
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,600
another person who's sort of genuinely interested in it. And they can't just be interested in

199
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,000
bullying you. They can't just be interested in making money. They can't just be a propagandist.

200
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,800
So for instance, I think there's no point having discussion with Richard Spencer,

201
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,680
as I've discussed at length with this point, because I think there's good,

202
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,720
very good reasons to say that nothing he says is genuine. And it's all kind of Trojan horse.

203
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,080
That's the thing, isn't it? Is that there are some, there are some, I mean, I did this in my

204
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,680
video on kind of white on white supremacist propaganda, which is greatly informed by your

205
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,720
video on your super video on white nationalism. Yeah, there are some points of view where it's

206
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,160
like if somebody says it's raining all the time, even when it's not raining,

207
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,320
it's like, oh, good. It's raining morning. It's like, what exactly does that mean in there?

208
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,720
And after a while, it kind of makes me start to wonder, well, what is this person really saying

209
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,200
here? If no amount of evidence can sort of convince hardcore Nazis that there really isn't

210
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,440
a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, then what are they really saying when they put forward that idea?

211
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,200
It's not really the idea that it's true. In which case, I'm kind of wasting my breath trying to

212
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,080
show them that it's not. Yeah. And unfortunately, I mean, I completely agree with what you said.

213
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,520
Unfortunately, the struggle I've had lately with the whole Nazi issue is that it's a great,

214
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,800
it's very difficult convincing many people of this because the rhetoric kind of works.

215
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Particularly, I think that someone like Richard Spencer is very good at persuading people. I mean,

216
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,880
this is exactly what his goal is. It's to persuade people that actually what he's saying is quite

217
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,920
reasonable and should at least be taken seriously. So you sort of get trapped into this position

218
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,840
where if you don't take it seriously, it seems like you're the one who hates free speech. You're

219
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,400
the real fascist. Well, Carl Schmitt saw this coming, didn't he? In the early 20th century,

220
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,360
he said liberalism would slide to the right. What's funny about this is that this notion

221
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,720
that liberalism slides to the right or that liberals will side with fascists is something

222
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,920
that I've heard this from leftists for years and have sort of vaguely sort of believed it,

223
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,360
but I didn't really feel it until recently. On YouTube recently, I honestly feel like

224
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,080
you know, Ionesco's play The Rhinoceros. I feel like I'm in The Rhinoceros. There's people turning

225
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,360
into rhinoceroses left and right and to see person after person who spent years calling people

226
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:07,320
femor-Nazis and black Hitler and then suddenly real ethno-nationalism comes along and they're

227
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,680
like, oh, well, these people are, I don't completely agree with them, but it's not called

228
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,640
them Nazis. They're ethno-nationalists. They believe in a peaceful redistribution of population

229
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:27,480
and you're just like, oh my God. It suddenly becomes horribly visible to me that if it comes

230
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,200
down to fascism versus anti-fascism, like I see what side these people are on and it's not

231
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,560
anti-fascism and it's a terrifying thing to watch happen. I was in a protest a while ago. I mean,

232
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,960
viewers in the UK might remember there was a bit of a thing going on in Trafalgar Square about a

233
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,800
month or a couple of weeks ago. It all got a bit heated. I was right there in the middle of that.

234
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,360
It was interesting because me and this one other guy who was just on his way at work or something,

235
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,160
he was in a suit and tie, reasonably elderly gent. We were pinned against the shop window

236
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,720
and I was there in my hoodie with my protest sign and he was there in a suit and his

237
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,400
very reasonable looking tie. The police were beating and arresting this Antifa guy in front

238
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,480
of us and the cry went up from the crowd, who defends the Nazis? Police defend the Nazis.

239
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,480
And this guy turned to me and said, it's a horrible thing to say. Why do they say that?

240
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,320
And I was like, look, they are. Like, that is what they're doing. And we had an interesting

241
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,520
discussion, actually me and him, about sort of people putting forward ideas that aren't really

242
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,200
supposed to be true. And so he's like, well, if you don't hear them out, aren't you kind of

243
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,840
censoring their viewpoint? And I was like, no, no, you haven't quite got it. Their viewpoint is not

244
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,040
like putting it forward as an idea to be true. That's them sort of broadcasting a secret message

245
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,200
like a value rather than a fact. So the idea that politics relies on facts,

246
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
always relies on facts. That's the dangerous thing because of course,

247
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,880
politics doesn't always rely on facts as well we know.

248
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Yeah. And I think this is the point I have the most difficult persuading people of,

249
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,600
that the usual kind of approach that you would take to a conversation or to a political

250
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,440
discussion is not the right approach when you're dealing with someone like Richard Spencer.

251
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,040
This was basically the whole point of the Roman millennial discussion. And the point that I just

252
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:27,560
was unable to persuade her of is the idea that you're making a fundamental error of some kind

253
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,400
if you take what's said as an indication of what's, as like a series of factual propositions

254
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,080
about what's true. That's not actually the way this language is functioning.

255
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,520
But of course then the question, yeah, not the way the language is functioning. That's a good

256
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,560
way of putting it. Then the question becomes, and this is a question I got from some of my

257
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,920
commenters when I did my video on white supremacist propaganda, is how do you tell?

258
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,520
How do you tell who's really putting forward the kind of, oh, this is true. I really do believe

259
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,000
in the world of Jewish conspiracy. And who's putting forward the covert message on the news?

260
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,240
How do you tell? Which I suppose, you know, we'd have to do case by case.

261
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,880
Yeah, I keep returning to this idea, because it's a big part of my acting training, of living the

262
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,920
questions, which is something that I floated in a video recently, which commenters didn't really

263
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,400
like very much. Can you say something about that idea?

264
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,680
It's really quite fascinating. So the poet, maybe I can find the quote from Rilke, because

265
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,400
I'll kind of explain why it's important to the acting training. So a lot of actors,

266
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,320
in particular actors in training, face questions like, oh, am I good enough? Or am I too anxious?

267
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Can I do this? Can I do that? And to try and sit down and answer that question and persuade

268
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,080
oneself of like, yes, I'm good enough to be an actor, is futile, because you can be able to maybe

269
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,680
spread yourself intellectually, but you'll still be nervous. So what we've been told is to really

270
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,160
take to heart this thing, this quote from Rilke, the poet, who said, be patient toward all that is

271
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,200
unsolved in your heart, questions like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a

272
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,760
very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you, because you would not

273
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,760
be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you

274
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,120
will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. And the

275
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,800
idea is that not every question can be sort of answered, cut and dry theoretically beforehand.

276
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,000
Some things have to be kind of felt out, which is a really interesting idea, because I came from

277
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,640
like a very academically theoretical background. And when I came across this idea and came across

278
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,880
people who sort of operate like that on the kind of living the questions route, rather than,

279
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,200
as I think out to many people who think about the questions and analyze them first,

280
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,520
that was very interesting to me. And I'm interested a lot at the moment in this

281
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,440
different approach to answering questions, which would seem to go against the kind of debate

282
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,240
theory, yes, let's sit down and talk about it, argue about it. Well, maybe let's just see how we go.

283
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,600
Yeah, that's interesting that you bring that up, because that also turns out to be a very important

284
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,680
point. And a lot of kind of social justice circles and feminism in particular, the idea that

285
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,200
there are some questions that you kind of need to rely on an experience to answer or to fully

286
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,840
comprehend that you can't just kind of like deduce the answer to these questions. And it's something

287
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:23,080
that—I mean, nothing could illustrate this more ridiculously than a recent incident on YouTube,

288
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,920
where a kind of pretty generic anti-SJW YouTuber named The Satiratician made a response to this

289
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,760
middle school girl teenager who had made this video. She made this video talking about her

290
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,400
experiences being catcalled as a 14, 15-year-old. And his response to this is, do you have any

291
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,160
evidence of being catcalled? How am I supposed to believe that you've been catcalled until

292
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,400
adequate evidence has been presented? And I'm just like, oh my god. Nothing exemplifies the worst of

293
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,400
what is meant by our ironic use of rationals than demanding that a teenage girl provide evidence of

294
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,920
having been catcalled. There's just no nuance in that. It's like, look, some conversations

295
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,680
acquire different standards of evidence. Like if you ask me for directions in the street and I go,

296
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,400
yeah, like, pub's down there. Are you not going to go, well, do you have a map or something?

297
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,440
Go and find out. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's enough to just go on.

298
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,760
Is there any evidence that the pub is in that direction?

299
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,640
Testimony is, I guess, a kind of evidence.

300
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,520
It's like the misapplication of a scientific standard of evidence to a situation where that

301
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,640
standard of evidence has no place. Right. It's like, yeah, epistemic injustice is—

302
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes. Epistemic injustice. So that's a phrase that's used in philosophy now.

303
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm explaining because I don't think this concept is very well known outside of

304
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,640
academic philosophy. But it's the notion that some people's—I guess it's a complicated

305
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,200
notion. I haven't thought about this a while. But one facet of it that I understand

306
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,480
is that some people's testimony is privilege above others, for instance.

307
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:12,840
Yeah. Well, yeah, I did a video on it a while ago and to sum it up, it's the idea that we can

308
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,240
sometimes do wrongs to people, specifically in their capacities as knowers of things.

309
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,160
So if, for instance, I mean, the example that Fricka uses is from To Kill a Mockingbird,

310
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,680
where the jury doesn't believe Tom Robinson's testimony because he's black, right? But she

311
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,400
says, look, he's trying to give you an item of knowledge there that he is innocent. And the

312
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,160
jury's saying, no, we don't accept that because he's black. She says that's a kind of epistemic

313
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,760
injustice. You're denying his ability to add to the collective pool of human knowledge on

314
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,680
prejudicial grounds. Yeah. And I guess the most very formal and explicit statement of that would

315
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,640
be in traditional Islamic law, I think it's like, what is it, like two women's testimony are needed

316
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,960
or something to match the testimony of one man or something along those lines. But I think

317
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,880
informally, we have the same thing where a teenage girl says that she's being cackled.

318
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,120
And I mean, for the record, anyone over the age of 10 who looks remotely like a woman has been

319
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:17,000
cackled. And so the idea that this, for something that doesn't, it's not an extraordinary claim. In

320
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,160
other words, it doesn't require much in the way of evidence. And there's a kind of basic trust that

321
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,880
you're supposed to bring to conversations where you believe that what someone says is their

322
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,960
everyday experience. I remember my Christian theology teacher telling me something similar

323
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,760
about the way the Christian communities view the testimony of women as well.

324
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,840
Actually, yeah, it's a topic that's really of interest to, I know, like philosophers of

325
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,440
religion and to theologians in general, because so much of faith relies on testimony and relies

326
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,120
on people's accounts of subjective experiences. And so this turns out to be the revelation.

327
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,320
Yeah, it's a hot topic in philosophy of religion, because it seems like these kind of claims,

328
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,240
of course, for people who are secularists or atheists, we reject that kind of testimony.

329
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,280
At least not as revealing what it claims to reveal.

330
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,120
But of course, religious people need to take it seriously to some extent.

331
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,040
Yeah, I guess so. I remember being very interested. I studied Christian theology for a

332
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,120
year at uni. And alongside philosophy, I remember being very interested in how Revelation was

333
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,840
supposed to work. And back then I was very, I was in a big sort of like rationalist phase.

334
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Yeah, I would stay with it.

335
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah, I think a lot of people do. Which is not, I know my commenters will jump down my throat and

336
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,840
say some people it's not a phase. It's Yes. Okay, fine. For me, it was. Yeah, it was really a lot

337
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,160
of Hitchens and Dawkins and so on. So I remember being very sort of critical in lectures. And

338
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,480
but then I suppose it's a it's a way of, of living the question. And I remember my,

339
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,320
one of my theology lectures, I suppose, I won't name his wife had died of cancer,

340
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,160
sort of 20 years prior to his coming to the uni. And he still, he'd kind of been with her this

341
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,720
whole time. And he's still very much believed in God. And I remember, I remember I didn't ask him

342
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,560
out loud, it would be quite rude. But I remember thinking, like, how do you kind of believe based

343
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,400
on that? And I suppose his answer would, having known him being something like lines, he just

344
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,440
comes does it one day at a time and sort of lives the question, I guess. And yeah, it's interesting.

345
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,720
How did we get on to that? I don't know. But I mean, let's see if I can circle it back around

346
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,040
to the debate thing. So sorry, I keep sort of no, no, no, all sorts of ridiculous. My inclination

347
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,320
is to go where, to go to whatever topic seems interesting. But, but, but so I think that,

348
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
so New Atheism, I think presents an interesting case for the argument about debate. Because I

349
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,280
think a lot of, so this is a theory that I'm constantly talking about online. A theory I have

350
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,680
is that current wave of like rationals is like the kind of direct, a lot of these people that

351
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,000
you run into online are in some ways the direct intellectual descendants of New Atheists. So this

352
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,120
was the, I mean, New Atheism was the hottest topic on the internet discussion, in the internet

353
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,560
political discussion world about, you know, nine or 10 years ago. Yeah, then it just seems to

354
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,880
sort of disappear. And then yeah, it disappeared or evolved into the horrible thing it has become.

355
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:26,280
But I think so, so Christopher Hitchens, for instance, is a man who I have many disagreements

356
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:32,920
with. But there's no question that he's one of the great debaters of his time. He was really good

357
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,120
he had this, and really good in particular at debating religious people, religious people who

358
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,840
are supposed to be this kind of like paradigm case of people who like, they, why would, you know,

359
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,480
you can't persuade them, like, why would you, why would you have an argument, you can't talk some

360
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,720
out of their faith is the usual idea. But I think a lot of people were persuaded by watching Hitchens

361
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,840
debate. And some of this has to do with his arguments being good, I think, I think certainly,

362
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:07,960
but also, this big, booming, single barrel voice that he had. And also just the fact that like,

363
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't mean in any way to impugn your intellect, but I think that people with English accents in

364
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,040
the United States get a bit of an easy pass. Like, I think you're a very smart person,

365
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,240
but I believe that you could convince half the state of Ohio that you were the intellect of

366
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,920
the century. You know, you're not the first blonde American academic to say that to me.

367
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:37,720
Yeah. And, and, and like, I think that, you know, I think Milo Yiannopoulos benefits from this

368
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,720
absurd foolishness of Americans. And that's strange. I mean, sometimes when we when we come

369
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,800
to America, we have to play the villains and it's only evil. And sometimes we can just say any old

370
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,560
Ross and people will be like, Hmm, yes, very good. Yeah, I think it's I think it's benefited

371
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:57,320
Milo Yiannopoulos, for instance. The problem simply is that Americans have not spent enough

372
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:05,400
time around dumb English people. Yes, yes. I think honestly, a week in London is a cure.

373
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
A week in London is a cure. A week in London may be a cure for many things and it's

374
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,640
many others. Yeah, I moved to London from the north nine months ago and I'm still getting used

375
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:25,160
to it really. It's a terrible place. But so to me, that is this idea, part of the idea

376
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:34,600
that we have online that debate is the like, ultimate. It's kind of is this, this,

377
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,120
this fetishistic thing that is the arbiter of truth. I think it comes from the effectiveness

378
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,840
of the sort of last movement of sort of intellectuals that were popular on the internet,

379
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,400
the fact that debate was used to create advantage by people like Dawkins and Hitchens.

380
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,400
Yeah, that's a good point. And maybe not just in the sort of argumentative sort of establishing

381
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,240
truth sense, but also in the rhetoric sense, because Hitchens, yeah, he could he could turn

382
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,720
a phrase. And so that's maybe that's interesting that it's that it's maybe come out of that to a

383
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,880
certain extent. Where do you think it'll go then? I don't know, but I think it looks bad.

384
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,280
We talked about like, it seems to be going in this Schmidian direction, right? Like, it seems that

385
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,080
that people alleging themselves to be rationalists have kind of, again, applied

386
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:35,640
what they think of as rationalism to white nationalist rhetoric in a naive way and have

387
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,000
come to be sort of sympathetic towards it. Whereas, you know, and I think this has to

388
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,040
do with the way that that, so this is the most generic imaginable leftist talking point that

389
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm about to repeat, but like the way that state or systemic violence or pressure or coercion

390
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,200
tends to go unseen, whereas any rupture with that tends to look like chaos and violence.

391
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,760
So, I mean, you have things to be violent against the backdrop.

392
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Again, you're mentioning the fact that in a clash with Antifa and the police, like,

393
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,840
nine out of 10 people are going to see horrible Antifa thugs against an agent of law and order.

394
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:22,600
And I think that the same is true. This is something I, this is something that I sort

395
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,480
of want to explore in a future video. But I think that oftentimes in debate, you know,

396
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,160
if you put a slick white nationalist with a, I don't know, a Jewish person or a black person

397
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:43,240
or gay person, and the white nationalist sits there talking about peaceful ethnic cleansing,

398
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,720
and like he simply wants a white homeland, just like everyone else is entitled to.

399
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:54,280
And like, do you go to Japan and insist that they, you know, allow 45 million immigrants?

400
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,880
Do you go to Africa and insist that only white people, that they have to allow all

401
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,160
these white people? No. So why do you insist that we, you know, so they're making these

402
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,320
kinds of like reasonable arguments. And then, if the Jewish person, the black person,

403
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,280
the socialist, whoever is the other interlocutor kind of freaks out or calls them a Nazi,

404
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,720
the rationals or the liberals will see this, and they'll see like a reasonable person trying

405
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,760
to make a point and this unfair person calling them a Nazi.

406
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,600
If people only have like four minutes to make their points, the person on the other side

407
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,240
doesn't have like time to sit down and go, look, here's like the history of the world.

408
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,320
Yeah. And it's the blindness to the violence and the inherent in the idea of white nationalists,

409
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,840
or the idea in which this is sort of fundamentally incompatible with meeting, two people meeting in

410
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,720
an honest discussion. The idea that this person wants to purge all people like that from society.

411
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,920
That's an idea that you can't really meet in a back and forth discussion on even footing.

412
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,440
It's not something that can really be up for debate.

413
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,320
It's a good question of values, really. Yeah, and very fundamental values. I mean,

414
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:14,600
if you think that the meaning of society is not, you know, that humanity is not what unites us in

415
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,800
society and we're not coming to meet each other on terms of humanity, but rather it's race,

416
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,440
then you've excluded all people who don't belong to the race from even the discussion,

417
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,920
from even participation in the society. And so that's it. The game is up for having discussion

418
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,920
between those people. And it's not because the person called them a Nazi or because they got

419
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,400
emotional. It's because the race or ethno-nationalist's ideas fundamentally

420
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
involve the exclusion of that person from politics.

421
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,080
Well then, all right. I like the way I just put that better than I ever

422
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,000
said it on the roaming millennial thing. I wish I'd copy that.

423
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,640
I guess to put it on its head then, because I can anticipate what some of my commenters might say.

424
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,240
Your great video, the debate between the hard land left and the bougie liberal,

425
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,520
was if we go into it thinking that there definitely has to be violence,

426
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,440
then it's a foregone conclusion. I suppose if we start saying things like,

427
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,720
this is going to sound really bad, but if we start saying things like there are certain people that

428
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,600
we can't debate with, again, I guess the question becomes is how do we know which ones they are?

429
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,840
I think that's the question that a lot of my commenters will ask. I think my answer to that

430
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:38,120
might be that, well, that forces us to engage with the idea that actually probably at a bottom

431
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,160
level all politics involves violence of some kinds, so it probably forces us to engage with,

432
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,400
okay, who are the targets of our violence and why? It forces us to see the end of our

433
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,520
own ideological noses, I suppose, whereas normally we don't look at them.

434
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,560
Yeah, because there's a sense that any kind of politics that we have will be

435
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,400
exclusionary in some way. That doesn't mean they're all equal.

436
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,800
But it has to do with who you're excluding. The norms of a liberal society or a society based on

437
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:21,800
free speech, free values, based on separation of church and state, based on all these things,

438
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,680
this involves exclusion. So, for instance, in the US the separation clause is supposed to exclude

439
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:34,360
religion from politics in such a way that anyone who wants to make an argument about policy based

440
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:41,560
on their religious convictions, that's excluded. That's off the table. I'm making this as a John

441
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Rawls point. You're not in the realm of public reason anymore, I guess, if you want to argue

442
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,920
from religious faith. It's interesting because we don't have that in the UK.

443
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,720
I guess it's a specifically American idea. If that's only in this election that's going

444
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,040
on at the moment, the leader of the liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, was getting brought

445
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,360
up on the idea that he was saying gay sex is a sin and so on, and that gay people, he said on

446
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,840
Twitter once, that gay people could be cured and so on. He was saying that based on religious

447
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,920
arguments. Yeah, we don't have separation of church and state here. In fact, the head of

448
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,640
state is also the head of the church. Yes, so I guess I should also clarify that, of course,

449
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,920
in practice in American politics, there's religious appeals constantly.

450
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah, explicit and coded ones, I understand it.

451
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,440
Yeah, explicit ones. The philosophical idea, the John Rawls idea anyway, is that

452
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,240
that's sort of not allowed in some moral or philosophical sense that you can't expect

453
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,840
because it excludes anyone who doesn't share your faith. You're not making an appeal to the

454
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,680
base of precepts that are supposed to be the things that we all agree on.

455
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,000
I suppose it's an argument, interestingly, it's an argument based on a kind of personal revelation,

456
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,320
I guess. It's an argument based on a kind of personal experience. But then we ourselves

457
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:11,560
were saying only a few minutes ago that sometimes that some people base things on experience and

458
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,560
that is very useful. So I guess what I would say what the difference is between listening to a

459
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,720
feminist based on their personal experience and appearing at the appeal of a theist on the basis

460
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,080
of a revelation has to do with the fact that I think a feminist can reasonably expect other

461
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:33,000
people to give some credence to their personal experience. Whereas I think that a religious

462
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,240
person sort of can't really expect people who aren't part of that faith to accept this as a

463
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,560
valid reason. Yeah, and I guess also it's to do with the sort of ordinariness and commonality of

464
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,600
experience. If somebody makes a video about how they've been cackled, then half of the world's

465
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,440
population might be like, yeah, that's a thing that can reasonably happen. Whereas if somebody

466
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,680
makes a video about having seen a divine vision in the sky, it's like, well, this is slightly more

467
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,680
rare. Yeah, or at least the divine vision claim. Again, it depends on what kind of society you're

468
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:10,440
living in. I'm sure in medieval Christendom, arguments were surely made all the time on the

469
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:18,120
basis of divine revelation. Demons were driven from a pig today. This was considered a valid

470
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:25,000
form of evidence, but because of the sort of philosophical underpinnings of our public reason

471
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,040
and our discourse, our society, we don't accept that kind of stuff as valid reasoning. It's not

472
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,440
universal enough. Only people who are in this specific faith will accept it. So it's sort of

473
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,920
excluded from the discourse of democracy because it's simply too specific to a certain group of

474
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,400
people. I suppose that might be why it's... So I guess one thing that follows from this,

475
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,760
maybe as concerns a debate topic, is that if you're going to have public discussions,

476
00:42:50,760 --> 00:43:00,680
if you're going to have public debates, there's sort of rules that regulate what's allowed in

477
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:08,200
debate. And one of those rules is that you have to sort of appeal to shared precepts in some ways,

478
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,720
otherwise there's nothing productive that can happen. If you appeal to a basic value that

479
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,800
someone doesn't share, that argument has no sway. Yeah, but also it's interesting sometimes that

480
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,440
important matters can rest on facts that aren't always shared very equally. So I mean,

481
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,640
maybe going back to that white nationalist versus someone on the left hypothetical thing we're

482
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,480
talking about, the kind of white nationalist is banking on the fact that, and maybe

483
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,160
reliant themselves on the fact that people generally are ignorant of a lot of

484
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:47,640
facts of history because they just simply aren't taught. Like, I remember once I went on a walking

485
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:58,600
tour of an Irish city, and we were taught all about the history of Ireland on this walking tour,

486
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,160
and me and my English friends were like, what? We were just never taught this. It's just not taught

487
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,360
in British schools, the extent of the horrors that we did in Ireland. And therefore,

488
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,280
certain very important things don't come up in public political debates because of that. So for

489
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,080
instance, when we had the Brexit referendum, people were saying, oh, yeah, we're going to

490
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:25,160
close the borders with the EU. And it was not really, I saw very publicly acknowledged that

491
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,080
to close the border with the EU would involve building a militarized border across the middle

492
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,800
of Ireland, which of course, you can walk down the road being the EU in part to Ireland. And

493
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,800
nobody kind of said, hang on a minute, haven't we built enough militarized checkpoints across

494
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,760
Ireland? And so that kind of, that lacuna ends up really affecting the debates that are even allowed

495
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,760
to occur, never mind that progress in certain directions. Yeah, so I think I guess I'm saying

496
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,240
something, I'm trying to say something different, because I think that when you are not appealing,

497
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,680
if there is factual information that you want to rely on, that's not widely known, you can always

498
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:09,400
bring up these facts. Because, so, you know, it was Dublin, not Ireland before I get.

499
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,560
Yeah. So for the, you know, an American equivalent of this would be, for instance,

500
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,760
like people now, Americans are so bewildered as to like, why do North Koreans like hate us so much?

501
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,440
Like, they're just crazy. But like, for some reason, they just hate America. And like,

502
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,040
everyone forgets, like, no one really seems to have any consciousness of the fact that like,

503
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,320
we went to war with them and just bombed the hell out of them. And like, hundreds of thousands or

504
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,240
maybe millions of people died. And like, Americans just have never been bombed. We just have no

505
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,560
conception of what that feels like. So we just assume, like, I don't know, Koreans are just

506
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,320
crazy. Like, they, for some reason, they hate us. I don't know why. Like, why is that? But like,

507
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,480
There are people in the UK, I mean, people in the UK say this about Islamic terrorism as well.

508
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,440
They're like, oh, why? They just got so angry. And we have MPs who are like, oh,

509
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,920
Islam is it? MPs at the MP level of the Conservative Party are like, or former MPs,

510
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,440
people like people like Lord Tebbit are like, oh, Islam is incompatible with British values.

511
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,160
And it's like, do you think it might have something to do with the Iraq war?

512
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,200
You know, when we interviewed captured ISIS soldiers, and they're like, yeah,

513
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,920
I'm doing this because of the Iraq war. Everyone's like, no, no, no, no, no, no,

514
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,640
it's because the values and freedom, they hate our freedoms. It's like,

515
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,520
revenge, revenge, renowned retaliation, you know, the three Rs. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

516
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,320
Well, it's very easy to forget a war when it was not waged in your country. And when your

517
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,400
people weren't drafted, and when, you know, so a lot of people made money off it as well.

518
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,920
So like, I think a lot of Americans are too, with the Iraq war, we're just like,

519
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,520
why is like, who still cares about that? Like, that was a long time ago.

520
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,520
They're still dead.

521
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,920
Just come back and respawn. Yeah, we're not, I can't speak for British curriculum as a whole,

522
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,800
but I wasn't really taught about slavery in Britain either. Not our history of slavery.

523
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,640
It was kind of, we had sort of 1066, Henry VIII, a little bit of Tudors, Elizabeth I,

524
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:11,320
World War One. It's like, sorry, what happened in between that? What? Oh, what? Nothing happened

525
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:19,880
then. We invaded the world and stole all their money. It's like, ah, there's that weird gap.

526
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,440
And for the same reason, we don't do the French Revolution, because that was all happening at the

527
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:30,040
same time. But I suppose with these kinds of things, you can at least bring them up,

528
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,840
like you can bring up the factual thing. So that's maybe not like, it's not an absolute

529
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,000
obstacle to discourse with someone because you can always bring this stuff up. I think where we have

530
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,200
a more difficult problem is when there's a kind of fundamental value that you don't share with

531
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,360
a person you're discussing. So I think one reason I find it difficult or impossible to have a real

532
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:57,880
conversation with a Nazi, for example, is that I share as a kind of basic presupposition of my

533
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:04,120
politics that human beings from different groups have equal moral worth as humans.

534
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,640
I guess I shouldn't say that because actually I know that they're getting smarter about this.

535
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,680
They say, well, we're not white supremacists. We don't think we're more important. We just

536
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,560
think that we deserve to have our own thing. So okay, fine. We'll pretend that we actually

537
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,360
believe they think that and go with their new thing, which is they think that society

538
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:35,240
should only include people from their race or from the race. And if I don't think that,

539
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,520
which I don't, there's almost nothing, like what can we say to each other to convince each other

540
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,640
that- There's a lot of point talking about the hows and the whys and the wherefores and the

541
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,920
economic this or that. Right. So we can sit around. What's going to happen if I debate

542
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,120
Richard Spencer? Suppose I actually am trying to have a conversation with him,

543
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,080
which I don't think I would ever try to do because I think that's a waste of time.

544
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:03,720
But let's try to imagine how it would go if I did do that. How am I going to persuade him?

545
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:10,440
We could start by talking about, I'm going to say, well, your plan to be peaceful and ethnic cleansing

546
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,240
will surely result in violence or something like that. But come on, the fundamental disagreement

547
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,920
is 25 steps before we get to that. But then you've granted him the idea that there's a peaceful,

548
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,680
there's even such a thing as peaceful- And I've granted him the idea that

549
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,600
peaceful ethnic cleansing would be something that would be okay to do even if we could do it.

550
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,200
And even you've granted him the idea that that's what he wants, what he really wants.

551
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:39,800
Yeah. So really the argument should start way before that, which is the idea that

552
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,400
so I mean, and they want to state it as an empirical question, right? Like, oh,

553
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,520
it's just a fact that diverse societies don't work or something. And they'll have evidence

554
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,960
that's supposed to show that. So I guess you sort of can try to use facts to argue values,

555
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:08,440
but often the facts are sort of off the main point. They don't think that they want an

556
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,240
ethno-state because diverse societies can't work. That's not really the chain of reasoning.

557
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,840
Yeah. I'm willing to put down a five.

558
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,680
Yeah. It comes down to the fact that they don't want to share their country with people not like

559
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:32,600
them in certain respects, right? And so they'll do what it takes. Every reason that goes to support

560
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,800
that is ultimately kind of post hoc rationalization. That's the right post hoc, that was it.

561
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:44,520
Yeah. And of course you can't prove the psychology of this, of course.

562
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:50,200
No. But again, it's raining. It's good it's raining morning. It's like, what?

563
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,920
Yeah. It becomes revealed to you in discussions. No matter how many times you argue that actually

564
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,800
unbalanced New York City functions fairly well, despite the fact that it has so much

565
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:13,960
ethnic diversity, they won't hear that. The subject, the conversation has changed.

566
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:21,560
It goes to crime. And then there's a wearing down as well. Nobody has the resource to fill

567
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,760
all these lacunas in history and facts and so on and to go through all the sources like someone

568
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,520
like Sean and Jen does and to go through every single marker on that map of crimes.

569
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,560
They did a great video a while ago where there was like a map of crimes committed by migrants

570
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,880
in Germany. And they went through every single one of them and was like, this is listed as arson.

571
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,160
There's a guy burning his toast. This is a different time. And they went through every

572
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,840
single one, but not everyone has the time to do that. Yes. And it's exhausting and difficult and

573
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,520
grueling to go through and debunk everything. And it's ultimately kind of pointless.

574
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,040
And it has absolutely no effect on the people who believe that.

575
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:08,200
Yeah. How do you see debate being sort of fetishized on YouTube? Because I see,

576
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,720
I get a lot of comments who are like, oh, you wouldn't reply to my comment. Why don't you

577
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,440
debate me? I'm like, yeah, that's not a debate. That's just a chat, you know?

578
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,320
Well, a lot of these demands that we get to debate are simply like people who,

579
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,440
you know, because I've often had people respond to my comment, respond to my comment, respond to

580
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:38,360
them. And if what I say is effective enough, they didn't delete all the comments. So it's bait. It's

581
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:44,120
what it is. It's bait to get you to engage. But I have had some very increasingly rare now.

582
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,000
But some of my favorite moments on YouTube is when I get comments of people who are like,

583
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:55,320
really angry. Like, oh, why did you say this? Like, fuck you. And then I go, that's interesting.

584
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,280
Tell me more about this. And then some of my favorite moments are when they then come back

585
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,880
and they go, I was angry when I said that. I'm sorry. I don't agree with you, but I see where

586
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,000
you're coming from. So I really like those engagements. But you're right. I mean, all

587
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,240
too often people just, they just want validation, not attention. But there's something like

588
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,480
that that they're after. Is it an attachment to our time?

589
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,000
Yes. Yeah. Oh, well, online is right. I got emails from like, just like egg accounts on

590
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,520
Twitter being like, debate me on my podcast. Like, will you come debate me on my podcast?

591
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,720
I'm like, what podcast? Who are you? Like, do you? Why? Like, why? Why would I do that?

592
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,280
You know what I mean? Like, it's weird entitlements demand that you

593
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,520
It's slightly, slightly cruel. But sometimes when when I get that, I just I just quote them

594
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,040
my sort of hourly tuition rates.

595
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Yes. Also, I want to be cautious not to get too I mean, we get worn down and on the idea

596
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,920
of engagement and become very cynical about it, I think. But I want to be careful not to get too

597
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,160
down on the idea of engagement too. Because as you said, like you do have these interactions

598
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,440
where someone later comes to you and says like, Oh, I was angry when I said that. And it seems

599
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,640
that they actually have thought about what you said. They actually have thought about what they

600
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,040
said in the sort of like, this kind of reconsidering has happened. So I definitely

601
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,720
have moments like that. And although I think overwhelmingly, the response that I get to doing

602
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,000
debates or conversations is just utter uselessness. You know, like, I'm like, put, you know,

603
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,080
the, you know, look at look at the comments on, you know, my debates with Blair roaming millennial

604
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,280
and you it's a lot of like, why should I take this disgusting training seriously? It's a lot of,

605
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,440
you know, just this guy. It's like, wow, I'm really this is really productive here, isn't it?

606
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,120
But then you also get I also get an often in private for some reason, the nicer things are

607
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,320
said in private, ugly things are said in public. I don't know why this is, but it often is the case.

608
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,040
But I'll have private messages from people who say that actually, like,

609
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,000
they find the whole thing to be incredibly eye opening and like revelatory and like,

610
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,200
and so it's like, okay, well, if some people if some people are getting something like,

611
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,720
Hmm, and I suppose if the idea is that everyone should have their say, and that's coming from

612
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,520
a place of compassion, then that's good. Like long may we all nurture those compassionate

613
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,680
impulses, even if Yeah, even if it is the case that Nazis will try and take advantage of them.

614
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,800
Yeah, that's not it's not all become too worn down and cynical.

615
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,880
So I guess, yeah, I guess there can be there's really can be a positive effect of debate. I

616
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:29,560
think it's just a matter of being of choosing who you debate with intelligently. So I

617
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,480
Which is a question that, you know, that's, that's not exactly ready. That's a living the

618
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,440
questions kind of thing. Yes. And so how do you choose? I mean, so I feel like I'm already getting

619
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:46,680
smarter about this. I would never debate Blair White again. Because I think that she's, she

620
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,760
doesn't care about what I say, and she doesn't care about what's true. I think that too much

621
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,800
of what her focus on is, like I said, I mean, she's a bully, she recently tweeted,

622
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,760
I never claimed not to be a bully. So I take it that she won't object to my calling her

623
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,800
bullies. She's she's never claimed not to be one allegedly, we now hear but so okay,

624
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,000
she's a self professed self without bully. So why bother with that? Like, why? Why go subject

625
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,680
yourself to that. But I don't regret the discussion with roaming millennial, even though I think a lot

626
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:21,240
of her audience is horrible. I think that she conducts a discussion in a way where something

627
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,280
sort of I mean, even if there's not any movement from the two people involved, it's possible to

628
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,440
have a conversation with roaming millennial in a way that people in the audience learn something.

629
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,960
And that I think is valuable. That's cool. That's very cool. So it's a matter of Yeah,

630
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,280
it's a matter of like getting a feel for who's worth engaging and who isn't. Yeah, yeah.

631
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,560
Looking at questions. Absolutely. And that's what I was gonna say was there.

632
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,880
And yeah, I can't remember. Maybe they'll come back to me. Yeah.

633
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,160
Let's see. Um, so

634
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:09,880
I feel like we we wanted to say enough about the fetishization of debate. I feel like we

635
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,120
keep touching on this, but without

636
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,800
Well, I can't I can't speak for you. But I get a lot of commenters who are like,

637
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,040
yeah, use the word debate when it seems like well, that's not a debate. It's a chat.

638
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,800
Or you know what, it's not a debate. So is there a discussion? What's the

639
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,040
distinction, I guess, between a debate and a discussion?

640
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:33,560
Oh, well, to my mind debate conjures up because I guess the experience of formal debating conjures

641
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:39,000
up images of sort of time limits and opportunities for people to sort of have rebuttals and speeches

642
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,920
from the fore. And it conjures up that image of suits and gowns really, whereas discussion

643
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,040
just sounds like more like this, I guess. And yeah, more fun.

644
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,880
Informality, a willingness to not so I think in a debate, I guess I would think you kind of

645
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,280
your people who have opposed positions, one of you is committed to one side, one of you is

646
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,160
committed to the other side. And your job in a debate is to represent the case as good as

647
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,960
possible. Yeah.

648
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,120
You say, oh, yeah, that's a good point. Like, yeah, maybe you're right. That you've lost like

649
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,960
that's bad. Whereas in a discussion, that's great. Because that means it's like, yeah,

650
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,000
now we share some common ground. You know, let's have another one.

651
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,080
Yes. So I think right in discussion, the attempt is much more to kind of reach some mutual

652
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:33,880
understanding. I guess I think mutual fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I think that people are often

653
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:40,920
so as regards what the goal of the discussion is, I mean, I think only in the best case scenario is

654
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,360
any kind of mutual understanding reached that doesn't often happen, especially when you're

655
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:50,520
dealing with people who are ideologically very distant. But I do think that what sometimes

656
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,000
happens more often than someone being persuaded in the course of a discussion is I know this is

657
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,400
the case with me rarely in my mid discussion, am I going to change my view about something,

658
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,200
but often I'll kind of a day or two later, thinking back on it, or like looking into

659
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,920
something the other person said, think like, you know what, I am not exactly correct about that.

660
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Yeah, yeah. And so maybe that guy I spoke to at that protest, who turned his nose up so much,

661
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,840
maybe he's now a month later, maybe he's a committed communist.

662
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,200
I think that, yeah, I think that's such an important thought to have. Not necessarily

663
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,560
he's a committed communist, but that some of the sense of futility that you have from

664
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,640
these discussions, it feels more futile than it is, I think, because maybe that someone

665
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,760
ends the debate by saying like, fuck you, Emily, that's the end of the discussion,

666
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:46,920
and they go off in a huff, or you go off in a huff. But later, you may not hear about it,

667
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,200
but it may kind of get into them and they might sort of refine their position.

668
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,880
Like locker rooms or books that are written in a foreign tongue, absolutely.

669
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,160
Yeah, exactly.

670
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Live some distant days there and say, yeah, see, the more I experience, the more I think

671
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:06,200
there's wisdom in real life. Oh, that was what I was going to say earlier on. Do you see this kind

672
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,560
of, you said that you were kind of learning more better who to engage with and who not to. I

673
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:19,000
remember learning that relatively early on when I did my video on gender. There was a YouTuber who

674
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,480
will remain nameless, who made a reply video. I think you know who it is. They made a reply video

675
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,880
to my video on gender. And it was hilarious because they quite clearly hadn't watched the

676
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,960
whole thing because they started bringing up arguments saying, what about this? What about

677
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:42,360
this? That I myself had mentioned in the video after the six minute mark. And they even, they

678
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:48,040
did it as a collaboration with someone else. And they clearly hadn't watched the whole thing.

679
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:52,360
And they invented, they made all these points. And then I wrote underneath, I was like, but I

680
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,600
said that, like, you can't say that I missed this out when I explicitly said it. And then they were

681
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,520
like, inventing, like, what if a trans person heard what you were saying about gender? Like,

682
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,680
you don't need to invent a hypothetical trans person. I cited two in the video, like,

683
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:10,360
go read this stuff. Like, I think it's a trans person would critique Judith Butler on this. And

684
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:17,320
I'm like, I know, I said that, like, so after that, I don't, and to all those people out there

685
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,000
who I know some are planning to make reply videos to my work, and I know some of them make them

686
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,600
anyway. I don't really watch them anymore because I don't really find them that useful. Of all the

687
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:35,080
reply videos I've ever watched, about 20 seconds of one of them I found useful. And the guys,

688
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,840
I still don't agree with the guy. But that was kind of useful because I hadn't considered it.

689
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,960
But the rest, I'm like, I just, I'm not going to watch it because maybe I'm missing out a huge

690
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,040
amount. Perhaps my commenters will be able to find ones that are brilliant. But I don't find

691
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,680
them all that useful on YouTube, particularly on YouTube. And yeah, listen to commenters and so on.

692
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,760
But on YouTube, I think there's a lot of the performative aspects. They're kind of like,

693
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:04,040
oh, the pwnage in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, I agree that there's certain people who's

694
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,600
like, responses to me, I'll watch it two times the speed to see the first three minutes and be like,

695
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:18,280
okay, this is good. Yeah. Yeah. But I, yeah, so I think that, you know, you try to stay open,

696
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,360
but also if something is, I agree, it's a widespread problem of people just like,

697
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:27,800
grossly misunderstanding things that you say, ludicrous straw manning of your arguments, or

698
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,640
again, just giving evidence that they haven't even watched your video. All these are problems.

699
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:39,960
And then also, just the, this is, yeah, you mentioned the video about like, you know,

700
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:46,440
skeptic destroyed your butthole, or whatever the comment that I was getting on these kinds of

701
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,120
comments. And so I kind of, yeah, I kind of want to go back to that, that idea of that video where

702
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:58,520
I talked about like, what I think the point of having a response video is, is it to destroy your

703
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,320
opponent? Or is it to try? So I think there's people who it's worth responding to. And that's

704
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,480
part of what I mean when I talk about choosing debates, is that because a guy like armored

705
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:14,200
skeptic, I disagree with him a lot. But in interacting with him, I get the sense that he's

706
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:20,760
sincere, that he thinks what he says, and that he's somewhat open to like, reconsidering things.

707
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,560
So I think that's a person who's worth talking to. And I also think that in order to make the

708
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,720
conversation worthwhile, both people have to come to the conversation with the understanding that

709
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:37,880
the goal is a discussion where you're both somewhat curious to get a handle on what that

710
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:44,840
person says. Yeah, curiosity. And you're not decided from the beginning, time to wreck someone

711
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,600
like, yeah, like, one of the phrases that we are taught in the end drama school is full of wisdom.

712
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,800
One of the things we're taught is curiosity, not ambition. Yes, great phrase, which is a,

713
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,840
that's a lovely phrase that Yeah, yeah. So and there's ways that YouTubers can I mean,

714
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,760
so this is my suggestion to YouTubers who want to make response videos is there's ways to do

715
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,240
response that don't involve pwnage. So if you want to make it entertaining, and I do this, like,

716
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,880
think of it in different terms. So I've used like, framing devices for response videos,

717
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:21,640
like inviting the person to dinner, or, or like seducing them, which I think, like, sort of help

718
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,360
a little bit to subvert the idea that it's pwnage. Yeah, I see the rabbit mask in the background. I

719
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:33,800
remember that. Yeah. And so so, again, I think if people would look at these alternatives to

720
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:38,680
the wrecking way, there's a way of having these discussions that could go so much better than

721
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:45,480
they tend to go. Hmm. Yeah, because it could be fun. Well, again, yeah, pints, just go for pints.

722
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,920
Yes. But I see people like Blair, like, you know, she'll have she'll she'll say, like,

723
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,440
oh, let's just have those people discussion in order to snag someone like me or Laci Green to

724
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,560
get on the debate. But then she goes back to her videos where, like, is there really there's no

725
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:03,560
actual like, there's no I've watched so many Blair White videos. I'm I'm so sorry for myself. I but

726
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:10,040
she she she does these like thing. I mean, is there ever a moment when she makes a video response

727
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:15,320
to Milo Stewart or to Riley Dennis, where there's ever an attempt at a genuine like human connection

728
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,520
or a genuine discussion in any way with the person she's talking to? Like there just never is.

729
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,200
I remember hearing about Milo Stewart through your video on them. Actually,

730
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:31,160
do people still people still bully them? Um, yeah, it's not as bad as it used to be. But

731
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:36,120
yeah, they tend to stay away from a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's channels.

732
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,040
Not where you're not losing anything. You're not missing out. Yeah. If you're avoiding these

733
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:47,800
bullying channels. Yeah. Just for you and PBS ID channel and a few others. Sean and

734
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:54,200
Jennifer cooking. Yes. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of channels not worth watching. I mean,

735
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,240
bearing my god, like this. I don't know if you know who this guy is. He's unfortunately,

736
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,120
he's it's a kind of like bullying shitty response channel. Huge, like 300,000 subscribers.

737
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:11,080
But he, I mean, so he did a response to my debate with Roman millennial where he what he did was

738
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,280
show clips of me and he deleted every single thing I said, except every time I say the word I think

739
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:23,000
and to me, and then he calls me a cunt and then you know, so okay, wow, like, and so you know,

740
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,240
my advice to all feminists and social justice YouTubers in terms of dealing with bearing

741
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:33,560
is do not interact with him except as an actual brown bear, because this is the level that you're

742
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,520
dealing with. Like there's no point in engaging this. Like this is a bear in the woods to say,

743
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,120
you leave a comment saying hi bearing your big brown bear and then leave don't watch the video

744
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,640
because there's no point like that. If someone's if, like I said, discussion is a two way road.

745
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:52,520
And if one person is not making good faith effort to discuss, don't you don't you there's no reason

746
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:58,360
for you to open yourself up. That's a waste of your time. Yeah, yeah. That's a shame that people

747
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:04,520
do that. Yeah, it's well YouTube is. I guess it's it's rewarded. YouTube is a shame. Yes,

748
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,760
I think yes, that slogan actually, it's not a corporate slogan. YouTube a shameful place.

749
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,880
Yeah, I think that's the last time I went to YouTube Space London and that was on the side

750
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:22,760
of the building. Yeah. A shameful place. I quite like that on a t shirt. Yeah, but I guess I don't

751
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,400
know. Like I say, I think there really are a lot of people on YouTube worth engaging. So it's not

752
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,600
a matter of me being against debate. I'm not against debate. I'm not against engagement.

753
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,640
I simply think and this is what this is the advice people gave me. And I didn't listen to it. I had

754
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:41,240
to learn it. I'm still learning it. But I have to I just I'm just someone like, I'm not a smart

755
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,520
person in the sense that I just believe people when they tell me things like I have to make all

756
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:51,800
every mistake myself like to play. I just I guess maybe it's a kind of I'm so such a rational

757
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:57,880
skeptic. I don't believe personal testimony. Every single mistake I must make on my own in order to

758
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,200
believe anyone about anything. So again, I had to I have to see for myself the liberals turn fascist.

759
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,440
I had to see for myself who isn't who is and isn't worth engaging in. And yeah, I'm still in

760
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,000
the process of it. So like I said, I'll probably do more debates that are mistakes. And that's just

761
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,800
part of making those mistakes. It's just part of my learning how to do this. I think sometimes

762
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,440
with debates, there's a little bit of um, there's a little bit of a kick who goes madman about it.

763
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,560
And I think I remember thinking this, I remember we really, really interested when I discovered

764
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,680
this story. So for those who may be watching who don't know, there's this fantastic story about

765
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:38,440
a lunatic who escapes from from an asylum. And he realizes that if he goes into town and just says

766
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,120
mad shit, then they're going to realize he's mad and they're going to send him back. So he's like,

767
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:47,880
ah, right. I will only say things that are uncontroversially true. And then nobody could

768
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,720
nobody's gonna lock me up for that. Like so he says, right. All I'm ever gonna say to anybody

769
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,560
is the world is round. So he goes into town and to every single person he meets like the world is

770
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,960
round, the world is round, the world is round, the world is round. That's all he says. And he's

771
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,440
right. Because it is. And they like pretty much immediately realizes realize that he's a madman

772
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,720
and they lock him up. And Kierkegaard told this story. And the point was, you can have all the

773
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,320
facts and all the truths and so on. And you can be like, technically true and correct, but still

774
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:19,960
wrong. If you've got the context wrong of why it matters. Walking around pubs saying the world is

775
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,960
round, everyone's gonna be like, what's wrong with you? Because yeah, you're right. But why?

776
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,800
Like, what are you saying? What's the act that's being performed here?

777
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,440
This is one of the things that you get out of studying philosophy, I think that like,

778
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,320
I miss them. So in a lot of ways, I hate interacting with other philosophy people,

779
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,040
not you, you're awesome. But like, a lot of academic philosophy people who are like,

780
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:47,320
especially like people who are like in the PhD route, you know, they get so involved in the

781
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,400
language of philosophy that they sort of lose the ability to communicate with a normal person,

782
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,000
because they've got this, this whole little technical way of doing it, which has some

783
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,920
advantages. But then when I go outside, and I talk to people with normal people, God, I suddenly wish

784
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:04,200
they knew philosophy of language. Because now, now there's this like, lack of distinction between,

785
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:10,440
you know, no one, I think very few people have this idea that just saying a fact is not enough,

786
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,960
like a fact is always presented as part of a bigger chain of reasons, or there's different

787
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,480
ways of stating facts. And right, you can state the fact the world is round. And if it's out of

788
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:26,360
context, it could be wrong, or it could be crazy. Right? Like, like, like, two and two makes what

789
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,480
the world is round. It's Yeah, wrong, wrong answer, like correct, but wrong. Or like,

790
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,240
in my video on on white supremacist propaganda, like, I was so pleased when I thought of this

791
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,920
example, and example, I love you, which which can be said, like 100 million different ways and

792
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,120
always be true and always mean the same thing, but do something so different to the person

793
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,760
hearing it every time. And, or another thing, another thing you get me with maybe the white

794
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,480
nationalist thing is you'll have people point out, like, here's a list of all the Jews involved in

795
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,720
the media and all the Jews involved in politics. And it's like, okay, yes, all those people are of

796
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,440
Jewish ancestry, and all of them are what you say. But like, so it's not that it's not a factual

797
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,160
dispute. It's the way it's what they're saying with it. Like how, of course, when you when you

798
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,040
point that out, they go, but I'm just listing the facts. Like, you're the one who's thinking that

799
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,040
just because I made a list of all the people who live in the neighborhood of this ancestry,

800
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:23,320
you're the real racists. Yes, it's well done. We can all do the Russian reversal.

801
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,200
And oftentimes, when you try to make these kinds of arguments, and this is again, the danger of

802
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,040
doing this on a public platform is I end up seeming like some kind of like, it's like the

803
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:37,000
sophistry of some fancy talking elitist by like, trying to like add this additional light, you know

804
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,560
what I mean? It seems like I seem like a weasel, or something for trying to get out and take

805
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,920
people's words and know what I'm going to do. But now that there's the tip of the iceberg,

806
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,200
and then there's everything else, like,

807
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,600
so again, you can imagine you can imagine having like a very an argument, a very belligerent

808
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,160
creationist, and the creationist wins the argument, because they, if you allow them

809
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,800
to lock you down with, so like, here's how this might go. Like, they'll say, like, can or cannot

810
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:08,120
a monkey give birth to a man? And you say, well, no, but and they say, aha. And like, you know,

811
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,760
but actually, these things are a gradual process over time, talking over time,

812
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,000
and like small genetic mutations. It's only over the course of millions of years. And he's like,

813
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,960
this fancy talking liberal thinks you should believe. He won't give a straightforward

814
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:33,000
answer to the question. And like, so there's ways of arguing that make sophistication seem

815
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:41,480
like deception. Yeah, yeah. That makes sort of crude fallacies seem like common sense.

816
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:47,480
Yeah, I suppose. There's something interesting in there about, just a half-form thought,

817
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:52,680
something interesting in there about education, and academia in particular being kind of gated

818
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,520
off to particular class interests. Traditionally, maybe there's something interesting in there,

819
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,800
but maybe that's another topic for another time. I'm happy to crack on with this and continue.

820
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,360
Can we have a tea break? Can I make tea? Will that be terribly boring for everyone?

821
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,080
Or are we, or is there anything more?

822
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,720
Sorry, do you want to say you want to continue the stream but make tea or do you want to

823
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,840
just call it? I had this time with me. I mean, yeah, I'm happy to keep talking.

824
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,880
All right, sure. I'll just talk to the chat while you do that.

825
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,400
It's either this or, you know, write an essay on Brecht, but I'll be pottering around in

826
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:33,320
the background making tea. All right, sounds good. Tea break.

827
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,640
It's the law, I'm afraid, in England. I can't go 90 minutes without tea.

828
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, he has no choice. It's the law of England. All right, I'm gonna look at the chat.

829
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,800
How's everyone doing?

830
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,520
While he's doing well, you know what, while he's making tea, I'm gonna do a shot because

831
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,320
this is America.

832
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,440
Shots! Oh, God, I'm almost out of booze. That's gonna be a problem because I'm supposed to go

833
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:08,440
talk to Destiny later about transracialism. I'm noticing all of you. All right, let's see.

834
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,880
Evan Williams. A good American whiskey. It's actually a bad American whiskey,

835
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,200
but it's drinkable. It'll do. It'll do its work.

836
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,440
It'll be like three in the afternoon for you.

837
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,800
Yeah, it's three. It's almost four in the afternoon, but it's Sunday.

838
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,360
Well, it's nighttime here, so.

839
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,160
All right, well, I'm trying to think of a good toast. Someone proposed toast.

840
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,680
I was thinking of doing an ironic hail victory, but I think I should not do that.

841
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,320
An ironic Richard Spencer hail victory.

842
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:47,820
Oh, dear.

843
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,840
If I want people to take my... Let's not do that. You know what? Nazis are literally

844
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:02,920
ruining me. I find myself... Their thoughts just infect my head. They're terrible, ironic

845
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,920
Nazism. It affects me. Not that I believe any of it, but it's just there. It's there in my head.

846
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm there trying to make breakfast or try taking a shower. I just find myself thinking about cucks

847
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,600
and thinking about cucking. It's just like, God damn it. I didn't used to think about this.

848
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,520
The alt-right has done this to me. They've put...

849
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,960
Yeah, and I find even in acting there's not a lot of escape because the three

850
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:28,280
plays that might end up being our showcase at the end of the year are all about Nazis and fascists.

851
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,840
Well, down with fascists.

852
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,960
Yeah, yes, down with fascists. Absolutely.

853
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,160
I say that without any irony whatsoever.

854
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,360
My man, I've not had whiskey in ages. I've not had whiskey since I lived in Scotland, actually.

855
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,280
Well, it's a good place for it.

856
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:45,880
Yeah, absolutely.

857
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,120
Evan Williams is not the smoothest of all whiskeys, I must say.

858
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,160
Are you a single malt or a blended person?

859
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,160
I'm a blended person for purely financial reasons.

860
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,640
Next time I do a Let's Play livestream, I think I'm going to start a whiskey fund

861
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,040
to raise some money for some decent whiskey.

862
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,640
Fair enough.

863
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,760
I think I'm relying on people who like whiskey to be evangelists.

864
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,480
Enough about good whiskey that they'll pay me to drink it.

865
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:25,640
This is one of the great things about whiskey people is that they're not satisfied with being

866
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,720
a whiskey person by themselves. They want everyone else to join them.

867
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,400
And so you can exploit this urge as a means of getting free whiskey.

868
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,680
Yeah, my friend John, the liquid guy on Twitter is a good whiskey drinker, I think.

869
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,600
Now I'm all teed up.

870
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,160
How is the chat? How is everyone?

871
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,200
They're doing just fine.

872
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,720
There's not a whole lot of Nazis here.

873
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,600
I must say, despite the common claim made by YouTube rationals that everyone has Nazis

874
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,160
in their chat, I'm not seeing a whole lot of it in my chat.

875
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,640
I wonder what it is that I do to keep the Nazis away.

876
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,560
Maybe it's not constantly sympathized with them.

877
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:10,760
Is it Ollie or Ollie, says workers of O-L-L-Y, if you prefer.

878
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,320
That'd be nice.

879
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:15,000
I remember I used to go by Oliver, which is my real name, but my first ever girlfriend

880
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,560
told me that Ollie with a Y was cuter, and I've been Ollie ever since.

881
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,920
Although my professional name is Oliver on acting credits, so I don't mind really.

882
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,080
Oh yeah, Le Pen lost.

883
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,400
I really should have been toasting to pen losing.

884
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,440
Well, I guess I did.

885
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,640
Down with fascists, yeah.

886
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,280
Down with fascists.

887
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,480
Down with fascists.

888
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,680
Oh, that's relaxing, isn't it?

889
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,280
What, whiskey?

890
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,960
Oh no, Le Pen losing.

891
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:38,760
I mean, also whiskey, but...

892
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,240
Oh yeah, I guess, yeah.

893
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,080
I really don't know much about Macron, so...

894
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,920
Yeah, he's not like a super great politician, but like my bar has sunk very low.

895
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,800
Yeah, it could be worse.

896
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,920
It could be worse, I guess, yeah.

897
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:58,840
My French friend will be relieved, I'm sure, who makes fun of my terrible French.

898
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,440
I spoke French in a video a while ago, and a few of my commenters were like,

899
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,400
oh, that's really great.

900
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,000
And then my French friend was like,

901
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,840
you sound like an English soldier trying to chat up a French country maid.

902
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,880
It's like, wow, how very specific.

903
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,480
Yeah, that's an interesting thing for your mind to go to first.

904
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,880
People are super chatting me to do another shot.

905
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,840
I will do, because you did that, I will do one more shot before the chat is over,

906
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,120
but I'm going to keep my composure.

907
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,200
Oh man, I wish I could have some.

908
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:28,760
That'd be great.

909
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,080
Well, that technology is not yet upon us, but someday.

910
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,680
Someday.

911
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,480
I'll stick with the tea.

912
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,200
I don't even have any booze in my whole flat.

913
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,420
Wow.

914
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:40,700
That's all right.

915
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,500
I woke up with a stinking thing over this morning, so I can do.

916
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,500
I had to go to a sword fighting lesson today,

917
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,180
which is the kind of thing you've got to do when you're an actor.

918
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,900
It's like, oh, please slip and kill me.

919
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,460
Can you please upload sword fighting videos?

920
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,700
Oh, oh, maybe.

921
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,860
They'd be very dull, it's all very slow motion, yeah.

922
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:07,420
Oh, I don't know.

923
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,740
There's a lot of great European martial arts and

924
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:14,380
European historical sword fighting channels on YouTube.

925
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,460
Now, this is another topic that many of these channels

926
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:22,220
also have just the slightest tinge of neo-fascism about them.

927
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:28,540
Yeah, who was the guy you used to make videos about who kind of played Skyrim?

928
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,300
The Golden One.

929
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:31,920
Yeah.

930
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,740
What was that about?

931
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,820
Oh, Tom to the glory of Evan Williams, yes.

932
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:36,620
Yeah, The Golden One.

933
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,140
So he's a fascinating character.

934
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:43,740
He's a Swedish bodybuilder who kind of does this larping Skyrim thing,

935
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:48,300
where he uploads himself playing Skyrim with his commentary,

936
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,420
and his commentary is gold.

937
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:53,660
I mean, of all the fascists, The Golden One is my favorite.

938
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,020
I mean, he's actually entertaining.

939
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,780
I never thought I'd say this, but it makes me feel weird inside,

940
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:04,220
because I'm like, this man believes things that I think are monstrous,

941
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,020
and yet I'm having a great time watching his YouTube videos.

942
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,180
I feel like it makes me feel so conflicted and weird.

943
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:15,660
But he's also given me the idea to play my own cock version of Skyrim.

944
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,780
I guess it's a kind of penitence for enjoying his fascist videos.

945
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:25,260
Skyrim, that's great.

946
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:26,780
I love that idea.

947
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,140
Oh, what's that?

948
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:28,940
You've got one video.

949
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,540
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.

950
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:31,840
Hmm.

951
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,020
I remember right back when I started,

952
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:39,340
I did a Let's Play series of a philosophy game called Socrates Jones,

953
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,140
which was quite fun.

954
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:41,340
Oh my gosh.

955
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,540
I haven't done any Let's Plays since.

956
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,180
It seems like everyone does them, so.

957
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:45,680
Yeah.

958
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:49,500
I'm an absolute noob when it comes to Let's Plays,

959
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,740
but I'm streaming Pokemon on my live stream channel.

960
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,340
I made a separate channel, by the way, guys,

961
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,020
if you want to check it out for live streams.

962
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,860
This is on my main channel, of course,

963
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,980
because I think this is a stream,

964
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,220
which until recently had some serious intellectual merit.

965
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,620
But I think that my live stream channel,

966
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,900
I want to, I just want a channel that I can just post whatever frivolous,

967
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,820
horrible nonsense that comes to my head.

968
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,980
And so without offending my usual subscribers,

969
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,780
so that's the point of that.

970
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,380
Yeah, I should do that as well.

971
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,340
I think this is somewhere I might start a second channel for my acting.

972
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:17,980
It's a lot of fun.

973
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,200
Yeah.

974
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:24,540
I think when a YouTuber builds up a certain fan,

975
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,940
you know, a fan base of a certain size,

976
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,300
you sort of feel this like intense pressure before you upload anything,

977
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,980
because you're like, oh, I don't want to disappoint people.

978
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,740
This has to be up to my standards of quality.

979
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,620
And so it's a great liberation to just make a new channel and be like,

980
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,980
oh, I can do whatever I want.

981
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,780
Yeah, I don't experience that.

982
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,140
But then I'm quite shit, so.

983
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,540
Well, I don't think you're that shit.

984
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:48,460
I think your videos are actually pretty well produced and thought out.

985
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,460
And I think you have more subscribers than I do.

986
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,500
I mean, I think that.

987
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,860
Not for long.

988
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,020
Well, I don't know.

989
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:57,520
We'll see.

990
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:04,220
But yeah, it's psychologically good for me to have a channel where I'm like,

991
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,300
I don't care if I don't care what happened from this channel.

992
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,160
Yeah.

993
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:13,020
Yeah, I kind of have to fit it around drama school,

994
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,900
which is like half five in the morning till sort of six at night every day.

995
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,460
So this is like the school is like a full time thing for you now.

996
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:18,960
Yeah.

997
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

998
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,200
I graduate in September and then I'll be I'll be an actor living in London.

999
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:23,700
Wow.

1000
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,720
Living the dream.

1001
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,000
Amazing thing.

1002
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,320
That's why I'm kind of learning to swing swords and

1003
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,160
ride horses and all the rest of it, because which is a lot of investment and time.

1004
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,400
But my casting is Shakespeare and period dramas.

1005
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,280
And doing that on TV would be great.

1006
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,960
But if I can't swing a sword and ride a horse,

1007
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,840
then all I'm going to be doing is opening the door to the character and saying that.

1008
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,200
And that'll be my only role.

1009
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,720
Whereas if I can ride the horse and swing the sword,

1010
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,240
then I can be Henry the fifth, you know?

1011
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,740
Yes.

1012
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,000
Well, I think you'd be great.

1013
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,280
Oh, thank you.

1014
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,080
It's not just the beard.

1015
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,480
Thank you very much.

1016
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,960
So you're interested in TV or stage or both?

1017
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,360
Anything.

1018
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,200
I'll do any of it because I love it all so much.

1019
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,600
Yeah, I've acted since I was very little and I would do anything they would let me do.

1020
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,580
Yeah.

1021
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:10,880
What about you?

1022
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,720
You're YouTube full time now, aren't you?

1023
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,320
Yeah, this is this is it.

1024
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,720
This is all I'm doing is YouTube every day, all day.

1025
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,200
That's funny.

1026
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,000
It's amazing.

1027
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,280
I love it.

1028
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,160
I wouldn't trade it for anything else.

1029
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,000
It's a lot of Nazis though.

1030
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,840
But it's a lot of Nazis, granted.

1031
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
More Nazis than most jobs.

1032
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,840
I mean, I'm working at least I'm working harder than I was when I was a PhD student.

1033
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,240
But I'm more happy than I was.

1034
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,000
That's great.

1035
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,440
So I mean, what I would say to people who want to be full time YouTubers is

1036
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,160
get ready to work like a corporate lawyer in terms of the hours you're putting in.

1037
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,160
It's so much more fun than being a corporate lawyer.

1038
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,600
So there's that advantage.

1039
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,000
But also, like, anything that you do.

1040
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
This is something I realized, like, I made some money, some actual money last weekend

1041
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,880
streaming Pokemon.

1042
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,760
And I was like, huh, maybe I could be one of these professional video game streamers.

1043
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,640
But the thing is that, like, anything that's work becomes work.

1044
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,680
Like, and those guys, I say guys, because they're just mostly guys.

1045
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,960
They're women who do it, too.

1046
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:17,360
But those guys who are professional streamers, they're doing like, 11 hours a day of this

1047
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:17,680
stuff.

1048
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,360
And I mean, you know, okay, so they're playing video games for a living.

1049
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,280
I'm sure they love it and wouldn't trade it for anything.

1050
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,280
But there's got to be days where they're like, I don't feel like playing Call of Duty today,

1051
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,120
but I have to to pay the gas bill.

1052
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,280
And I just play Scrabble once in a while.

1053
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:31,920
Yeah.

1054
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,440
Just long for reading.

1055
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,840
Yes, yes, exactly.

1056
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,800
I kind of long for reading.

1057
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,560
I don't get to read that much anymore.

1058
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:43,520
Because, yeah, I just don't have time.

1059
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,120
Yeah.

1060
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,440
I mean, I'm very lucky that the fans sometimes buy me books from my Amazon Wishlist.

1061
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,080
I have a big pile of them stacked up at the moment.

1062
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,840
I suppose I don't have much time to read because drama school is getting very intense in the

1063
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,400
final term.

1064
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,520
But yeah, I'm reading and you, in fact, you, the laptop are currently stacked on top of

1065
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,320
a few books.

1066
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,320
One of which is Marjorie Garber's, what is it?

1067
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,360
Vested Interests, which is all right.

1068
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,160
It's kind of slow going.

1069
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:15,520
I'm reading that and I'm also reading, I got it for my birthday, Vladimir Nabokov's Arda,

1070
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,200
which is good, but it's kind of long.

1071
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,360
So it's slow going, but then I have a little long tube journey.

1072
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,060
Yeah.

1073
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,000
The year before I started doing this channel, I was trying to, my initial idea was I was

1074
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,720
going to write fiction.

1075
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,640
That was what I thought I wanted to do when I left grad school.

1076
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,280
That's great.

1077
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,320
And yeah, great.

1078
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,160
But it's not like, man, if you want that as a career, like, God help you.

1079
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,280
Yeah, it's very difficult.

1080
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:45,440
I eventually gave up on it, but I was reading so much because I was just doing jobs to get

1081
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:45,600
by.

1082
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,760
So I was an Uber driver in Baltimore, also horrible, horrible job, never do it.

1083
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,360
I was like a copy editor.

1084
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:59,760
I taught a couple of classes, but I, you know, just worked enough to pay the rent and I had

1085
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,800
a ton of time to read.

1086
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,320
So I read all these classic novels.

1087
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,120
I read Moby Dick.

1088
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,000
I read Middlemarch.

1089
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,320
I read just things that I will never, I'll probably never have a year of my life that

1090
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,480
has so much ambitious reading in it starting now, which in some ways is too bad because

1091
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,480
I feel like reading all this stuff, it does, like, it expands your mind.

1092
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,600
It's actually good for you.

1093
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,720
I missed reading fiction.

1094
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,160
I don't get to read, I don't really love fiction, which is why this person got me harder and

1095
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,160
why I'm working my way through 20,000 weeks under the sea as well.

1096
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,300
Yeah.

1097
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:29,840
Yeah.

1098
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,120
I miss reading fiction.

1099
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:31,780
Yeah.

1100
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:34,720
I'd like to do it.

1101
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:38,560
I just, I mean, I guess I could, I could make time if I really wanted to.

1102
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,760
It would be less tweeting.

1103
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,120
Tweeting is the thing that's got to go.

1104
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,480
I spent so much time tweeting.

1105
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:42,720
Yeah.

1106
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,560
I deleted Twitter off my phone a while ago.

1107
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,120
Yeah.

1108
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,800
And it's the future.

1109
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,760
It's amazing.

1110
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,240
Yeah.

1111
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,960
I've still got it on my laptop, so I can do all the kind of tweeting I need to do for

1112
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,440
the channel.

1113
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,680
But yeah, I got rid of it on my phone.

1114
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,120
I'm like, oh, I can see birds.

1115
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:57,680
It's amazing.

1116
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:58,740
Yeah.

1117
01:26:59,280 --> 01:26:59,780
Yeah.

1118
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:05,040
We had a thing on the course called living history where we go and we live in the 17th

1119
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:10,960
century in character for a week, basically, but obviously no Twitter.

1120
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,960
And everyone came back from that and was like, yeah, I'm deleting all this social media off

1121
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,440
my phone.

1122
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,360
And I was like, yeah, we're doing that too.

1123
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:17,860
It was good.

1124
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,520
Very good detox.

1125
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,680
Someday I may well have to hit you up to do some Shakespearean stuff on my channel.

1126
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,680
Oh, please, please do.

1127
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,720
I would love to.

1128
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,120
Yeah, I think that'd be a lot of fun.

1129
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,440
I used to have a second channel called Shakespeare Vlogs where I would vlog in character of Shakespeare.

1130
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,320
Oh my gosh.

1131
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,520
And it would start off as Hamlet being like, oh, I'm really sad about my day and blah,

1132
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:37,840
blah, blah.

1133
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,440
But then it would go into reverse.

1134
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,280
Why is this not in my life?

1135
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,160
I'm probably going to bring it back once I stopped it just before I started my training

1136
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,640
because I thought, okay, I'm getting better, but I might get into bad habits if I don't

1137
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,360
have any guidance.

1138
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,960
So I think over the summer, hopefully, hopefully, and now that I've said it on the live stream,

1139
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:53,920
of course, people will hold me to it.

1140
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,840
Hopefully, over the summer, I'd like to bring that back under some kind of guise because

1141
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,560
that was a lot of fun.

1142
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,360
And it's all practice towards the acting as well, which is good.

1143
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,080
It's good stuff.

1144
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:04,480
But yeah.

1145
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,560
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

1146
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,960
I think that I can definitely imagine there being an audience for it.

1147
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,720
One thing that's fascinating is even though people, I feel, don't read that much these

1148
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,080
days, fiction is kind of pretty marginal as an art form.

1149
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,120
You know, this is something I noticed when I was trying to write and read it is that

1150
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:26,640
contemporary fiction is a very specialized area where I think most people are sort of

1151
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,840
not plugged into it.

1152
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,640
But people love Shakespeare still.

1153
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,080
They just love it.

1154
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,320
And I'm not sure why exactly.

1155
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,280
I mean, obviously, it's great, but lots of things are great, and people don't love those

1156
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:37,680
things.

1157
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,360
You know, but people love Shakespeare.

1158
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,320
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1159
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,640
Milton is beautiful.

1160
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,680
People don't love Milton.

1161
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,560
That's true.

1162
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,040
That's true.

1163
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,000
I would love Shakespeare because I'm an actor.

1164
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,840
I have so many brilliant roles in it.

1165
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,760
And yeah, I could go on for hours.

1166
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,680
But yeah.

1167
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,840
No, I would like to do a Shakespearean channel.

1168
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,880
And if you ever need any Shakespeare, let me know.

1169
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,480
I almost definitely will need some Shakespeare.

1170
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:06,960
Oh, I'd love to.

1171
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,000
Super duper.

1172
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,240
Right.

1173
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,680
Well then, I suppose I really should write this essay on Brecht.

1174
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,000
All right.

1175
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,320
All right.

1176
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,480
Well, you can go write the essay on Brecht.

1177
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,600
Because someone superchatted me to do a shot.

1178
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,040
I'll do one more shot.

1179
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,960
Oh, I don't really have to.

1180
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,240
I just wanted to get you drunk faster.

1181
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,240
That's what it is.

1182
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:31,200
And then check out my Twitter later if you want to see my thing on Destiny.

1183
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,240
I'm going to go think about what I'm going to say to try to talk him out of this nonsense.

1184
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,240
What is it?

1185
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,000
Or maybe he'll, I don't know, maybe he'll talk me into it.

1186
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,640
I don't know.

1187
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,400
But so it's Destiny.

1188
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,080
He's a professional streamer.

1189
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,920
He's a really interesting streamer because he, I like Destiny because he's a guy who

1190
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,080
he tells the story of having been quite a bit of a shitlord a few years ago.

1191
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:57,360
And he's since sort of backed out of those positions.

1192
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:01,120
And that's an intensely attractive thing to me because it makes me feel like I'm not wasting

1193
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,080
my goddamn time.

1194
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,880
And also, I feel like to some extent I've moved in the same direction over the last

1195
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,520
several years.

1196
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,120
So I tend to hit it off really well with him.

1197
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:17,360
But he wants to make the philosophical case that there's a good analog between transracialism

1198
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:25,120
and transgenderism, which is something that is extremely frowned upon in social justice

1199
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:25,920
circles.

1200
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:31,520
So I'm going to go and talk to him about it.

1201
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,200
But anyway, thank you.

1202
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,760
Oh, I guess I'll do my shot now.

1203
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,120
Oh, yeah, go for it.

1204
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,880
Yeah, down with fascism, down with a pen.

1205
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,560
Down with fascism.

1206
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,560
What a drink.

1207
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,680
Well, on that note, thank you all for tuning in.

1208
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,800
And Oli, thank you so much for...

1209
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
God damn it, there's a kangaroo in this stream.

1210
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,560
Thank you, Oli, so much.

1211
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:03,840
My pleasure.

1212
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,880
Thank you so much for having me.

1213
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,760
It's been lovely.

1214
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,200
Yes, we'll have to do this again sometime.

1215
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,040
All right.

1216
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,480
Thanks, everyone, for watching.

1217
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,360
Bye, everyone.

1218
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,160
Bye.
