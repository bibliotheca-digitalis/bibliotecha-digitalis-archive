00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
Hello, and welcome to my first ever attempt at broadcasting a live debate. Fittingly,

00:09.160 --> 00:15.840
the topic is, is it worthwhile to broadcast live debates? And my guest is Ollie, one of

00:15.840 --> 00:21.080
my favorite YouTubers who runs a channel called Philosophy Tube. Link is in the description,

00:21.080 --> 00:24.880
please go check it out. And Ollie, you want to introduce yourself?

00:25.840 --> 00:31.400
Well, yeah, thank you very much for having me on, Nick. As you say, I run a channel called

00:31.400 --> 00:37.400
Philosophy Tube. I do like a 10 minute or so video every week teaching philosophy. When

00:37.400 --> 00:41.080
the British government tripled tuition fees, I decided I'd give away my degree for free

00:41.080 --> 00:45.160
online. So that's what I do. And I'm a long time follower of your work as well, an admirer of it.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.920
Thank you. Yeah, it's funny that you say give away your work for free, because in a sense,

00:49.920 --> 00:54.960
that's also the way I think of what I do, is that I feel that I've been given this kind of

00:54.960 --> 01:01.040
gift of an education from society. And I do feel some obligation to just like, give it out for

01:01.040 --> 01:06.760
free. Because one of the frustrations I think of being in university is how elitist it is and how

01:06.760 --> 01:13.040
much money you have to pay to get access to that information. But anyway, so we're talking about

01:13.040 --> 01:19.440
whether debate is worthwhile. So I thought I'd start just by saying a little bit about why this

01:19.480 --> 01:27.600
topic seems like it needs to be discussed. So I think debate is something that has kind of this

01:27.600 --> 01:33.640
important role in our discourse. We think of it as this cornerstone of democracy. It's something

01:33.640 --> 01:39.800
that we hold up as a way of finding out what is true. But I think in most of our personal

01:39.800 --> 01:44.960
experiences, we know that that's not always the case. Debate seems to have this element of

01:44.960 --> 01:52.280
performance. It seems to often rely on things like people's personal appearance and how likable a

01:52.280 --> 01:57.220
person is, things that have nothing to do with what is true or who's correct. So the question

01:57.220 --> 02:04.000
that's raised is debate as important as we say it is. And it's something that I've been asking

02:04.000 --> 02:10.640
myself recently as I've been doing debates and discussions with conservatives or far-right people

02:10.640 --> 02:15.280
on YouTube. And a lot of people on the left have kind of questioned whether I'm smart to do that.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.400
And the criticism ranges from minor criticism, like you're putting yourself through a lot of

02:19.400 --> 02:23.960
emotional agony for the sake of little benefit, to outright you're doing the wrong thing. You're

02:23.960 --> 02:32.120
giving a platform to people who shouldn't have a platform. Stop doing this. So I don't know. Do

02:32.120 --> 02:38.240
you come to this with a position that you hold in general on the utility of debate?

02:38.240 --> 02:45.800
I don't know. I mean, I come to it with a little bit of personal experience. So I, at my uni,

02:45.800 --> 02:49.880
we were talking about elite institutions, there was a fairly high-flying debate society that I

02:49.880 --> 02:54.480
went along to occasionally, and didn't really find it a massively useful use of my Wednesday

02:54.480 --> 03:00.800
nights. I did win a prize there once, because I deliberately gave a speech that contained an

03:00.800 --> 03:06.160
argument that I knew didn't work. And then they gave me the prize for that speech. And I was like,

03:07.040 --> 03:12.160
probably not going to come anymore, guys. So it was fun. But I don't know, it's interesting. I mean,

03:12.160 --> 03:19.480
the kicker is, is it the way to truth? And I'm not sure it always is. It can be, certainly. But

03:19.480 --> 03:26.680
yeah, I don't think it is always the way to truth for the reasons that you mentioned, because it is

03:26.680 --> 03:31.640
kind of, it can become a grandstanding thing. People can sort of play to the audience a bit

03:31.640 --> 03:35.000
too much. And it can be influenced by things that people have, sort of, that aren't really

03:35.000 --> 03:40.480
relevant to the points, like dress and so on, and likeability and charisma. And so, yeah, I'd

03:40.480 --> 03:44.600
certainly, I mean, if the question is, is it important? I'd say, yeah, yeah, it depends what

03:44.600 --> 03:49.800
you mean by important. It's very important in some senses. But is it the way to truth always,

03:49.800 --> 03:57.280
necessarily? I'm inclined to think maybe not. But I don't know. Maybe, yeah, I'm kind of,

03:57.280 --> 04:01.480
because this is something I'm wondering about at the moment, rather than coming at it directly with

04:01.480 --> 04:07.040
a point I want to argue. I'm living the question, as we say in acting. Because, yeah.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.200
So hang on one second, I'm gonna respond to that. I feel that I may have somehow the

04:12.200 --> 04:16.400
permalink to this debate may have gotten public because a couple people have suddenly added into

04:16.400 --> 04:20.760
this Google Hangout. So I'm gonna make sure that I didn't tweet that link or something stupid like

04:20.760 --> 04:28.480
that. Did I? Was that me? Oh, yeah, maybe it was you. Oops. You might want to delete that tweet.

04:28.960 --> 04:36.560
Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think, okay, hopefully we're good. Otherwise,

04:36.560 --> 04:40.360
we're gonna be inviting random people. Well, which could also be interesting. We can debate

04:40.360 --> 04:47.320
them. But anyway, yeah, so I think bringing up the formal debate society is like, that is kind

04:47.320 --> 04:55.640
of an important point to raise. Because when you have formal debates, people are often assigned

04:55.920 --> 05:02.040
which position of the debate to take. So I know when the high school debate teams and so on,

05:02.040 --> 05:06.920
you win by being the most persuasive. But of course, people don't choose what they're arguing.

05:06.920 --> 05:11.520
So there's a kind of culture that revolves around debate societies or around a professional debate

05:11.520 --> 05:19.240
that involves simply having the greatest rhetoric, not being true. So, I mean,

05:19.240 --> 05:24.760
Classes and so on will sort of have classes in providing sample arguments rather than saying,

05:24.760 --> 05:30.320
you find out whether or not you're correct. It's kind of, the classes are given in light,

05:30.320 --> 05:35.360
as you say, in the rhetoric. And that's kind of weird and interesting. And the fact that,

05:35.360 --> 05:39.280
and how do you measure how persuasive someone is? How do you do that without,

05:39.280 --> 05:43.040
I mean, you have to have like a control group, like a blank audience who know nothing about

05:43.040 --> 05:47.520
anything. And then it's kind of sent in and it's like, who do you agree with? I don't know,

05:47.520 --> 05:52.920
the guy in the red tie, I don't know. So how do you measure how persuasive someone is?

05:53.720 --> 05:58.440
I've actually never been involved in a formal debate team, like in that kind of competitive

05:58.440 --> 06:01.600
environment or competitive debate. What my understanding of the way that works is,

06:01.600 --> 06:07.640
they have judges and judges evaluate arguments. I assume that those evaluations include things

06:07.640 --> 06:12.880
like checking for logical fallacies and things like that, so that the guidelines would include

06:12.880 --> 06:19.800
that the reasoning is sound. But if, I mean, this is not how, for instance, a presidential debate

06:19.800 --> 06:24.480
in the US on CNN gets judged. In fact, in the last few presidential elections, they've,

06:24.480 --> 06:28.040
I don't know if they do this in the UK too, but in the televised coverage of the debates,

06:28.040 --> 06:34.040
they'll include this feature where it sort of shows the audience reaction, like in live time.

06:34.040 --> 06:39.240
So you'll have like, it's like a line graph that's plotted by like how much people agree or

06:39.240 --> 06:44.360
disagree with what the person is saying. Right, right. So if someone starts saying like,

06:45.000 --> 06:51.080
like, hooray for the troops, like I support the troops, the line graph starts going up and up and

06:51.080 --> 06:56.760
up. And if they start saying like, I don't know, no politician would say this, but if they say,

06:58.200 --> 07:02.120
just because you give someone a gun doesn't make them a hero. The graph bottoms out,

07:02.120 --> 07:08.040
everyone hates them. But this purely empirical way of evaluating debate, but both based on

07:08.040 --> 07:15.240
public perception, that seems like a real problem. Because, I mean, the famous instance in the US is

07:15.240 --> 07:23.320
this JFK-Nixon debate, or the first debate where Nixon was like sweaty and not very appealing to

07:23.320 --> 07:29.480
the TV audience. And JFK obviously is this handsome presidential charismatic figure. And so

07:30.760 --> 07:37.240
the perception is very much of the JFP is more presidential and more, you know, so it's

07:38.680 --> 07:43.160
there's a performance art to it. And some of it does have to do with the way you look and so on.

07:45.080 --> 07:52.920
But it's maybe a useful performance, right? I mean, it's in a way, any kind of rhetoric

07:53.560 --> 07:58.600
sometimes can go beyond, rhetoric can be evaluated independently of how true the rhetoric,

07:58.600 --> 08:03.240
independent of the truth of what's being said. So, but you wouldn't want to say that don't have

08:03.240 --> 08:07.240
good rhetoric, because it doesn't have to do with truth. So debating still might be a skill worth

08:07.800 --> 08:15.000
cultivating. Oh, absolutely. And certainly, I've found, like, in acting, this was like what I do,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.520
I'm an actor now. It's that the kind of experience I have of debating in formal debates was very

08:20.520 --> 08:25.480
useful. And yeah, you're right, just because it's there's a sort of performance element to it

08:25.480 --> 08:30.920
doesn't mean that it's not important. And that's kind of what I was into earlier on. And yeah,

08:30.920 --> 08:35.080
it is interesting. I mean, one of the one of the things that's going on in the UK right now is that

08:35.080 --> 08:40.600
we're about to have an election and then the current Prime Minister is not going to be

08:40.600 --> 08:46.840
debating the leader of the main opposition party, Theresa May. She won't debate Jeremy Corbyn,

08:46.840 --> 08:51.240
probably says what she says right now. And that, yeah, that's kind of very interesting.

08:51.240 --> 08:56.440
I was like, why not? And everyone's wondering why she isn't. And some people are saying it's

08:56.440 --> 09:00.440
because she's like, doesn't want to do like the Nixon thing of like, appearing to be a sort of

09:01.400 --> 09:07.080
haunted mannequin. But you know, who knows? And yeah, it's very interesting.

09:08.120 --> 09:12.120
Yeah, so I say when there's there's also something special that happens when someone refuses to

09:12.120 --> 09:17.960
debate or they don't debate, this is usually taken to be like a sign that you Oh, like you,

09:17.960 --> 09:22.120
your ideas won't hold up. Yeah, I get Yeah, I imagine you get that a lot.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.920
I mean, I get it. Maybe less than other people get it, because I have a couple of times

09:26.920 --> 09:32.600
shown up to do these debates. But I also think that there are legitimate reasons to not want

09:32.600 --> 09:36.920
to debate and there are people who shouldn't be debated. So I think there's something to be said

09:36.920 --> 09:41.800
for not debating, for instance, Milo Yiannopoulos. And I know that this is something that I'm

09:41.800 --> 09:49.320
thinking of an article, this well known article by the feminists, Penny read about not debating

09:49.320 --> 09:56.280
Milo, because he is someone who I think most of us think he doesn't really care. He's not interested

09:56.280 --> 10:01.320
in what's true. He's a kind of performance artist. And if you're debating someone like that,

10:01.320 --> 10:05.480
there's part of you that thinks that you've lost if you even show up, because you can't.

10:07.880 --> 10:12.280
This idea of good faith comes up a lot to me too. For instance, as a criticism of my debating Blair

10:12.280 --> 10:17.960
White, that there's a notion that she's someone who's not really willing to kind of meet halfway.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.680
Or not necessarily meet halfway, but who's sort of not interested in

10:25.480 --> 10:29.400
pursuing the truth in some sense. So there's some kind of performance art to it that goes beyond

10:29.400 --> 10:35.560
that. So I think I retract saying meet halfway, because I think meet halfway is kind of a bullshit

10:35.560 --> 10:39.240
thing to expect people to do, especially when you're debating people on the way far right.

10:39.240 --> 10:46.920
You don't want to meet halfway on that. But I think that you use the term rap battle

10:47.720 --> 10:57.000
to describe one way of thinking of debate as a kind of performance art. And this is something

10:57.000 --> 11:01.720
I see on YouTube too, the idea of debate as this kind of like, pwnage contest.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.880
Yeah, I mean, I remember that you had that video, you had a video, it was really good. I forget

11:05.880 --> 11:09.720
which one it was actually, but like, we were like, oh, he came in and like tore you apart,

11:09.720 --> 11:16.520
like went in Socrates and you have panties and so on. It's just like, what is that really?

11:16.520 --> 11:21.240
Is that really the path to truth? Or is it? I've quite been, there's a channel I've been

11:21.240 --> 11:26.360
watching recently, Sean and Jen. I've quite been enjoying Sean and Jen's videos recently. I put it

11:26.360 --> 11:29.400
on while I'm cooking just because I really enjoy Sean's voice. It's a great channel.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.280
Yeah, yeah. And I have to confess, I don't go and watch the videos that Sean's,

11:34.280 --> 11:38.360
Sean admirably says go and watch the videos to make sure I'm not misrepresenting. I do actually

11:38.360 --> 11:44.680
just listen to Sean and Jen because I like Sean's voice. And I put it on while I'm cooking. So I

11:44.680 --> 11:48.280
guess there's even a performative aspect to somebody like that, sort of trying to engage

11:48.280 --> 11:52.440
in this debate. And then maybe it's, I'm just kind of refusing to take it as what it's meant to be.

11:55.080 --> 12:00.280
Yeah, that is kind of interesting. Yeah. So I think like a debate in particular,

12:00.280 --> 12:05.480
so the goal, I guess, what is the goal of debate? I mean, it's not really to persuade the other

12:05.480 --> 12:10.280
person. I don't think that this is a big mistake to think that that's the goal of a debate. So

12:10.280 --> 12:14.760
sometimes people criticize me for doing debates by saying, oh, don't argue with this person. Like,

12:14.760 --> 12:19.640
they'll never persuade them. Well, of course someone persuade them. It's for the sake of

12:19.640 --> 12:25.400
the audience. And so I think that I heard someone's, I forget who, I think this was just

12:25.400 --> 12:30.920
like a random YouTube comment or something I saw. They said that the only thing debate can

12:30.920 --> 12:36.680
accomplish is to make sure that two people aren't straw manning each other. And I think there's some

12:36.680 --> 12:41.320
truth to that. It's sort of what you're doing when you have a debate with someone some of the

12:41.320 --> 12:45.640
time is you're saying, it sounds to me like you're saying this thing that I think is horrible. And

12:45.640 --> 12:49.320
then they say either, yeah, that is what I'm saying, but that's not horrible. Or they say,

12:49.320 --> 12:54.040
no, you've misunderstood me. So in a sense, one of the things debate accomplishes is it sort of,

12:55.640 --> 12:59.720
it helps, it gives people a chance to say that a straw man version of their claim isn't what

12:59.720 --> 13:05.640
their claim is. I suppose, yeah. That might be a good use of it. I quite like that.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.080
I remember somebody said something very intelligent to me this morning when I was

13:11.080 --> 13:13.960
telling them about what I was going to be doing this tonight. They said,

13:15.720 --> 13:20.440
it's quite odd that people would, because I'm sure you get commenters as I do, like demanding

13:20.440 --> 13:26.040
debate saying, oh, this must be debated. Or once you say, you've said this, other YouTubers said

13:26.040 --> 13:30.520
this, you should debate them. And this person said to me this morning, those comments are very

13:30.520 --> 13:35.960
interesting because an intelligent person could infer debate. Like if I'm claiming X and somebody

13:35.960 --> 13:40.440
else is claiming Y, then it's like, well, as long as we understand both claims, then we understand

13:40.440 --> 13:44.760
that there's a debate there. It doesn't need necessarily to be this performative clash,

13:44.760 --> 13:49.320
like tonight at eight, that's a royal rumble between, yeah. It's just kind of not really

13:49.320 --> 13:55.960
required. So, right. This is like definitely a kind of philosophy way of thinking about things

13:55.960 --> 14:01.240
too, is that you should, if you're good, be able to build up an argument based on what you know

14:01.240 --> 14:05.560
two people to say, and you should be able to build, you could sort of an imaginative argument

14:05.560 --> 14:09.960
between two people. And I sort of try to do that in some of, I do some videos where I will do a

14:09.960 --> 14:14.440
kind of dialogue, like I did this Nazi punching video, where I had two sides, each of which I

14:14.440 --> 14:19.480
thought had something of value to say. And I kind of tried to, instead of having an actual debate

14:19.480 --> 14:25.000
about it, just I made a fictional one, where I sort of tried to imagine what, how the two ideas

14:25.000 --> 14:29.720
of a person will clash. And anyone should be able to do this, if you know enough about the side that

14:29.720 --> 14:35.400
you're saying. And some ways that maybe, yeah. And some ways that maybe, go ahead, go ahead.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.800
I said, I suppose the risk of doing yourself and playing both roles, although I kind of as an actor

14:39.800 --> 14:43.800
really appreciate the kind of theatricality of that, I suppose the risk would be somebody saying,

14:43.800 --> 14:47.560
ah, but if it's just one person behind it, then you kind of, you're avoiding the straw manning

14:47.560 --> 14:50.680
thing. So you might still be straw manning them. And I love the video.

14:50.680 --> 14:55.480
The risk with that is you're then speaking for someone else, and so you're definitely a risk

14:55.560 --> 15:01.800
of straw manning. But what you also can do is you can avoid this kind of tonight at nine,

15:01.800 --> 15:08.680
clash of personalities thing. And that is what, to me, one of the most discouraging things about

15:08.680 --> 15:12.760
the way people respond to debates is that when I say, when I've posted that I'm going to have

15:12.760 --> 15:16.440
a discussion with a roaming millennial or whoever I'm talking to on YouTube, a lot of people do

15:16.440 --> 15:20.600
respond with popcorn eating gifts and like, you get the sense that like, oh, they just want to

15:20.600 --> 15:27.400
see this like shit show, go down. Because to avoid the kind of tonight at nine,

15:27.400 --> 15:31.960
clash thing, it's like, well, that's just pints. Like, just go for pints, like, or just do this,

15:31.960 --> 15:40.760
just have this. Like, it's just a chat. It doesn't need to be sponsored by whoever.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.400
Just go have pints. Like, it's fine. But then there are plenty of people I wouldn't want to

15:45.400 --> 15:48.760
have pints with. And I've had plenty of pints with people where it's gotten pretty heated. So

15:49.320 --> 15:56.280
yeah. So I think that I love the idea of it being pints. I mean, I think that's not,

15:56.280 --> 16:00.600
I think that's actually sort of the difference between discussion and debate. And I think on

16:00.600 --> 16:06.680
YouTube, although actually, the debate society at my uni were pretty heavy drinkers as well.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.680
When I was at Georgetown, there was something called the Philodemic Society, which was like

16:14.680 --> 16:21.080
a bunch of LARPing, bougie, pretentious people who wanted to roleplay that they were at Cambridge

16:21.080 --> 16:26.840
in the 1950s. God, they sucked. But not all of them.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.520
LARPing, bougie, Cambridge.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.360
Yeah, it was awful. But yeah, there was also a lot of drinking.

16:34.040 --> 16:34.920
A lot of people going, no!

16:35.720 --> 16:39.880
A lot of people who just love just like wearing a suit and projecting their voice.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.760
Oh yeah, the debate society that was at my uni. It was suits and ties and gowns.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.920
I used to go along, because they used to allow floor speeches at the end of the night.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.440
So I was doing quite a lot of stand up comedy at the time. And I used to go along and just

16:54.440 --> 16:58.760
do like five minutes of new material, just because I had a cast of audience who weren't allowed to,

16:58.760 --> 17:03.640
like, they're not allowed to boo. They're only allowed to either say shame or resign.

17:03.640 --> 17:08.760
And I'm like, that's inherently hilarious. So I used to go along and test out my material

17:08.760 --> 17:13.480
and try and work it into the topic of it, just to mess with them. It's good fun.

17:13.480 --> 17:17.560
Yeah, so but if a discussion is more worth having than debate, I think there's also,

17:19.480 --> 17:23.880
maybe there's an issue that comes up a lot lately. Are there people not worth having

17:23.880 --> 17:27.400
discussions with? I think the answer to this is clearly yes.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.240
Especially in London, where it's five quid a pint. There are plenty of people.

17:32.200 --> 17:40.760
Yeah, that's absolutely not worth it. But so I think that there has to, you know,

17:40.760 --> 17:46.520
so to build a bridge, there has to be something to build a bridge to. There has to be

17:49.080 --> 17:52.600
another person who's sort of genuinely interested in it. And they can't just be interested in

17:52.600 --> 17:59.000
bullying you. They can't just be interested in making money. They can't just be a propagandist.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.800
So for instance, I think there's no point having discussion with Richard Spencer,

18:01.800 --> 18:04.680
as I've discussed at length with this point, because I think there's good,

18:04.680 --> 18:09.720
very good reasons to say that nothing he says is genuine. And it's all kind of Trojan horse.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.080
That's the thing, isn't it? Is that there are some, there are some, I mean, I did this in my

18:15.080 --> 18:20.680
video on kind of white on white supremacist propaganda, which is greatly informed by your

18:20.680 --> 18:25.720
video on your super video on white nationalism. Yeah, there are some points of view where it's

18:25.720 --> 18:29.160
like if somebody says it's raining all the time, even when it's not raining,

18:29.160 --> 18:33.320
it's like, oh, good. It's raining morning. It's like, what exactly does that mean in there?

18:33.320 --> 18:37.720
And after a while, it kind of makes me start to wonder, well, what is this person really saying

18:37.720 --> 18:42.200
here? If no amount of evidence can sort of convince hardcore Nazis that there really isn't

18:42.200 --> 18:46.440
a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, then what are they really saying when they put forward that idea?

18:46.440 --> 18:50.200
It's not really the idea that it's true. In which case, I'm kind of wasting my breath trying to

18:50.200 --> 18:55.080
show them that it's not. Yeah. And unfortunately, I mean, I completely agree with what you said.

18:55.080 --> 19:00.520
Unfortunately, the struggle I've had lately with the whole Nazi issue is that it's a great,

19:00.520 --> 19:05.800
it's very difficult convincing many people of this because the rhetoric kind of works.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.440
Particularly, I think that someone like Richard Spencer is very good at persuading people. I mean,

19:10.440 --> 19:13.880
this is exactly what his goal is. It's to persuade people that actually what he's saying is quite

19:13.880 --> 19:18.920
reasonable and should at least be taken seriously. So you sort of get trapped into this position

19:18.920 --> 19:22.840
where if you don't take it seriously, it seems like you're the one who hates free speech. You're

19:22.840 --> 19:29.400
the real fascist. Well, Carl Schmitt saw this coming, didn't he? In the early 20th century,

19:29.400 --> 19:34.360
he said liberalism would slide to the right. What's funny about this is that this notion

19:34.360 --> 19:37.720
that liberalism slides to the right or that liberals will side with fascists is something

19:37.720 --> 19:42.920
that I've heard this from leftists for years and have sort of vaguely sort of believed it,

19:42.920 --> 19:48.360
but I didn't really feel it until recently. On YouTube recently, I honestly feel like

19:49.320 --> 19:55.080
you know, Ionesco's play The Rhinoceros. I feel like I'm in The Rhinoceros. There's people turning

19:55.080 --> 20:00.360
into rhinoceroses left and right and to see person after person who spent years calling people

20:00.360 --> 20:07.320
femor-Nazis and black Hitler and then suddenly real ethno-nationalism comes along and they're

20:07.320 --> 20:12.680
like, oh, well, these people are, I don't completely agree with them, but it's not called

20:12.680 --> 20:17.640
them Nazis. They're ethno-nationalists. They believe in a peaceful redistribution of population

20:17.640 --> 20:27.480
and you're just like, oh my God. It suddenly becomes horribly visible to me that if it comes

20:27.480 --> 20:32.200
down to fascism versus anti-fascism, like I see what side these people are on and it's not

20:32.200 --> 20:37.560
anti-fascism and it's a terrifying thing to watch happen. I was in a protest a while ago. I mean,

20:37.560 --> 20:41.960
viewers in the UK might remember there was a bit of a thing going on in Trafalgar Square about a

20:41.960 --> 20:45.800
month or a couple of weeks ago. It all got a bit heated. I was right there in the middle of that.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.360
It was interesting because me and this one other guy who was just on his way at work or something,

20:50.360 --> 20:55.160
he was in a suit and tie, reasonably elderly gent. We were pinned against the shop window

20:55.160 --> 20:59.720
and I was there in my hoodie with my protest sign and he was there in a suit and his

21:00.280 --> 21:07.400
very reasonable looking tie. The police were beating and arresting this Antifa guy in front

21:07.400 --> 21:13.480
of us and the cry went up from the crowd, who defends the Nazis? Police defend the Nazis.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.480
And this guy turned to me and said, it's a horrible thing to say. Why do they say that?

21:17.480 --> 21:23.320
And I was like, look, they are. Like, that is what they're doing. And we had an interesting

21:23.320 --> 21:28.520
discussion, actually me and him, about sort of people putting forward ideas that aren't really

21:28.520 --> 21:34.200
supposed to be true. And so he's like, well, if you don't hear them out, aren't you kind of

21:34.200 --> 21:38.840
censoring their viewpoint? And I was like, no, no, you haven't quite got it. Their viewpoint is not

21:39.800 --> 21:44.040
like putting it forward as an idea to be true. That's them sort of broadcasting a secret message

21:46.120 --> 21:50.200
like a value rather than a fact. So the idea that politics relies on facts,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.800
always relies on facts. That's the dangerous thing because of course,

21:54.920 --> 21:57.880
politics doesn't always rely on facts as well we know.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.840
Yeah. And I think this is the point I have the most difficult persuading people of,

22:02.840 --> 22:08.600
that the usual kind of approach that you would take to a conversation or to a political

22:08.600 --> 22:12.440
discussion is not the right approach when you're dealing with someone like Richard Spencer.

22:14.840 --> 22:20.040
This was basically the whole point of the Roman millennial discussion. And the point that I just

22:20.040 --> 22:27.560
was unable to persuade her of is the idea that you're making a fundamental error of some kind

22:27.560 --> 22:33.400
if you take what's said as an indication of what's, as like a series of factual propositions

22:33.400 --> 22:37.080
about what's true. That's not actually the way this language is functioning.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.520
But of course then the question, yeah, not the way the language is functioning. That's a good

22:40.520 --> 22:43.560
way of putting it. Then the question becomes, and this is a question I got from some of my

22:43.560 --> 22:46.920
commenters when I did my video on white supremacist propaganda, is how do you tell?

22:46.920 --> 22:50.520
How do you tell who's really putting forward the kind of, oh, this is true. I really do believe

22:50.520 --> 22:55.000
in the world of Jewish conspiracy. And who's putting forward the covert message on the news?

22:55.000 --> 22:59.240
How do you tell? Which I suppose, you know, we'd have to do case by case.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.880
Yeah, I keep returning to this idea, because it's a big part of my acting training, of living the

23:05.880 --> 23:10.920
questions, which is something that I floated in a video recently, which commenters didn't really

23:10.920 --> 23:15.400
like very much. Can you say something about that idea?

23:15.400 --> 23:22.680
It's really quite fascinating. So the poet, maybe I can find the quote from Rilke, because

23:22.920 --> 23:27.400
I'll kind of explain why it's important to the acting training. So a lot of actors,

23:27.400 --> 23:31.320
in particular actors in training, face questions like, oh, am I good enough? Or am I too anxious?

23:31.320 --> 23:35.320
Can I do this? Can I do that? And to try and sit down and answer that question and persuade

23:35.320 --> 23:41.080
oneself of like, yes, I'm good enough to be an actor, is futile, because you can be able to maybe

23:41.080 --> 23:44.680
spread yourself intellectually, but you'll still be nervous. So what we've been told is to really

23:44.680 --> 23:49.160
take to heart this thing, this quote from Rilke, the poet, who said, be patient toward all that is

23:50.120 --> 23:56.200
unsolved in your heart, questions like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a

23:56.200 --> 24:00.760
very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you, because you would not

24:00.760 --> 24:06.760
be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you

24:06.760 --> 24:12.120
will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. And the

24:12.120 --> 24:17.800
idea is that not every question can be sort of answered, cut and dry theoretically beforehand.

24:17.800 --> 24:23.000
Some things have to be kind of felt out, which is a really interesting idea, because I came from

24:23.000 --> 24:27.640
like a very academically theoretical background. And when I came across this idea and came across

24:27.640 --> 24:31.880
people who sort of operate like that on the kind of living the questions route, rather than,

24:31.880 --> 24:36.200
as I think out to many people who think about the questions and analyze them first,

24:36.840 --> 24:40.520
that was very interesting to me. And I'm interested a lot at the moment in this

24:41.480 --> 24:46.440
different approach to answering questions, which would seem to go against the kind of debate

24:46.440 --> 24:51.240
theory, yes, let's sit down and talk about it, argue about it. Well, maybe let's just see how we go.

24:53.080 --> 24:56.600
Yeah, that's interesting that you bring that up, because that also turns out to be a very important

24:56.600 --> 25:02.680
point. And a lot of kind of social justice circles and feminism in particular, the idea that

25:02.680 --> 25:08.200
there are some questions that you kind of need to rely on an experience to answer or to fully

25:08.200 --> 25:14.840
comprehend that you can't just kind of like deduce the answer to these questions. And it's something

25:14.840 --> 25:23.080
that—I mean, nothing could illustrate this more ridiculously than a recent incident on YouTube,

25:23.080 --> 25:30.920
where a kind of pretty generic anti-SJW YouTuber named The Satiratician made a response to this

25:30.920 --> 25:36.760
middle school girl teenager who had made this video. She made this video talking about her

25:36.760 --> 25:43.400
experiences being catcalled as a 14, 15-year-old. And his response to this is, do you have any

25:43.400 --> 25:49.160
evidence of being catcalled? How am I supposed to believe that you've been catcalled until

25:49.160 --> 25:55.400
adequate evidence has been presented? And I'm just like, oh my god. Nothing exemplifies the worst of

25:55.400 --> 26:01.400
what is meant by our ironic use of rationals than demanding that a teenage girl provide evidence of

26:01.400 --> 26:06.920
having been catcalled. There's just no nuance in that. It's like, look, some conversations

26:06.920 --> 26:10.680
acquire different standards of evidence. Like if you ask me for directions in the street and I go,

26:10.920 --> 26:15.400
yeah, like, pub's down there. Are you not going to go, well, do you have a map or something?

26:16.280 --> 26:20.440
Go and find out. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's enough to just go on.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.760
Is there any evidence that the pub is in that direction?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.640
Testimony is, I guess, a kind of evidence.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.520
It's like the misapplication of a scientific standard of evidence to a situation where that

26:32.520 --> 26:37.640
standard of evidence has no place. Right. It's like, yeah, epistemic injustice is—

26:37.800 --> 26:43.800
Yes. Epistemic injustice. So that's a phrase that's used in philosophy now.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.760
I'm explaining because I don't think this concept is very well known outside of

26:49.480 --> 26:55.640
academic philosophy. But it's the notion that some people's—I guess it's a complicated

26:55.640 --> 26:58.200
notion. I haven't thought about this a while. But one facet of it that I understand

26:59.400 --> 27:03.480
is that some people's testimony is privilege above others, for instance.

27:03.960 --> 27:12.840
Yeah. Well, yeah, I did a video on it a while ago and to sum it up, it's the idea that we can

27:12.840 --> 27:19.240
sometimes do wrongs to people, specifically in their capacities as knowers of things.

27:19.800 --> 27:25.160
So if, for instance, I mean, the example that Fricka uses is from To Kill a Mockingbird,

27:25.160 --> 27:28.680
where the jury doesn't believe Tom Robinson's testimony because he's black, right? But she

27:28.680 --> 27:33.400
says, look, he's trying to give you an item of knowledge there that he is innocent. And the

27:33.400 --> 27:39.160
jury's saying, no, we don't accept that because he's black. She says that's a kind of epistemic

27:39.160 --> 27:44.760
injustice. You're denying his ability to add to the collective pool of human knowledge on

27:44.760 --> 27:50.680
prejudicial grounds. Yeah. And I guess the most very formal and explicit statement of that would

27:50.680 --> 27:55.640
be in traditional Islamic law, I think it's like, what is it, like two women's testimony are needed

27:55.720 --> 27:59.960
or something to match the testimony of one man or something along those lines. But I think

28:01.560 --> 28:05.880
informally, we have the same thing where a teenage girl says that she's being cackled.

28:05.880 --> 28:10.120
And I mean, for the record, anyone over the age of 10 who looks remotely like a woman has been

28:10.120 --> 28:17.000
cackled. And so the idea that this, for something that doesn't, it's not an extraordinary claim. In

28:17.000 --> 28:21.160
other words, it doesn't require much in the way of evidence. And there's a kind of basic trust that

28:21.160 --> 28:25.880
you're supposed to bring to conversations where you believe that what someone says is their

28:27.080 --> 28:31.960
everyday experience. I remember my Christian theology teacher telling me something similar

28:31.960 --> 28:34.760
about the way the Christian communities view the testimony of women as well.

28:35.640 --> 28:40.840
Actually, yeah, it's a topic that's really of interest to, I know, like philosophers of

28:40.840 --> 28:48.440
religion and to theologians in general, because so much of faith relies on testimony and relies

28:48.440 --> 28:54.120
on people's accounts of subjective experiences. And so this turns out to be the revelation.

28:54.120 --> 28:59.320
Yeah, it's a hot topic in philosophy of religion, because it seems like these kind of claims,

29:00.760 --> 29:05.240
of course, for people who are secularists or atheists, we reject that kind of testimony.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.280
At least not as revealing what it claims to reveal.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.120
But of course, religious people need to take it seriously to some extent.

29:16.760 --> 29:22.040
Yeah, I guess so. I remember being very interested. I studied Christian theology for a

29:22.040 --> 29:26.120
year at uni. And alongside philosophy, I remember being very interested in how Revelation was

29:26.120 --> 29:32.840
supposed to work. And back then I was very, I was in a big sort of like rationalist phase.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.840
Yeah, I would stay with it.

29:34.840 --> 29:39.640
Yeah, I think a lot of people do. Which is not, I know my commenters will jump down my throat and

29:39.640 --> 29:44.840
say some people it's not a phase. It's Yes. Okay, fine. For me, it was. Yeah, it was really a lot

29:44.840 --> 29:49.160
of Hitchens and Dawkins and so on. So I remember being very sort of critical in lectures. And

29:49.160 --> 29:53.480
but then I suppose it's a it's a way of, of living the question. And I remember my,

29:54.600 --> 30:01.320
one of my theology lectures, I suppose, I won't name his wife had died of cancer,

30:01.320 --> 30:07.160
sort of 20 years prior to his coming to the uni. And he still, he'd kind of been with her this

30:07.160 --> 30:11.720
whole time. And he's still very much believed in God. And I remember, I remember I didn't ask him

30:11.720 --> 30:17.560
out loud, it would be quite rude. But I remember thinking, like, how do you kind of believe based

30:17.560 --> 30:21.400
on that? And I suppose his answer would, having known him being something like lines, he just

30:21.400 --> 30:26.440
comes does it one day at a time and sort of lives the question, I guess. And yeah, it's interesting.

30:26.440 --> 30:31.720
How did we get on to that? I don't know. But I mean, let's see if I can circle it back around

30:31.720 --> 30:38.040
to the debate thing. So sorry, I keep sort of no, no, no, all sorts of ridiculous. My inclination

30:38.040 --> 30:43.320
is to go where, to go to whatever topic seems interesting. But, but, but so I think that,

30:44.200 --> 30:48.200
so New Atheism, I think presents an interesting case for the argument about debate. Because I

30:48.200 --> 30:52.280
think a lot of, so this is a theory that I'm constantly talking about online. A theory I have

30:52.280 --> 30:56.680
is that current wave of like rationals is like the kind of direct, a lot of these people that

30:56.680 --> 31:03.000
you run into online are in some ways the direct intellectual descendants of New Atheists. So this

31:03.000 --> 31:08.120
was the, I mean, New Atheism was the hottest topic on the internet discussion, in the internet

31:08.120 --> 31:13.560
political discussion world about, you know, nine or 10 years ago. Yeah, then it just seems to

31:13.560 --> 31:17.880
sort of disappear. And then yeah, it disappeared or evolved into the horrible thing it has become.

31:17.880 --> 31:26.280
But I think so, so Christopher Hitchens, for instance, is a man who I have many disagreements

31:26.280 --> 31:32.920
with. But there's no question that he's one of the great debaters of his time. He was really good

31:33.160 --> 31:38.120
he had this, and really good in particular at debating religious people, religious people who

31:38.120 --> 31:42.840
are supposed to be this kind of like paradigm case of people who like, they, why would, you know,

31:42.840 --> 31:47.480
you can't persuade them, like, why would you, why would you have an argument, you can't talk some

31:47.480 --> 31:53.720
out of their faith is the usual idea. But I think a lot of people were persuaded by watching Hitchens

31:53.720 --> 31:58.840
debate. And some of this has to do with his arguments being good, I think, I think certainly,

31:58.920 --> 32:07.960
but also, this big, booming, single barrel voice that he had. And also just the fact that like,

32:09.400 --> 32:15.000
I don't mean in any way to impugn your intellect, but I think that people with English accents in

32:15.000 --> 32:22.040
the United States get a bit of an easy pass. Like, I think you're a very smart person,

32:22.040 --> 32:25.240
but I believe that you could convince half the state of Ohio that you were the intellect of

32:25.240 --> 32:30.920
the century. You know, you're not the first blonde American academic to say that to me.

32:30.920 --> 32:37.720
Yeah. And, and, and like, I think that, you know, I think Milo Yiannopoulos benefits from this

32:37.720 --> 32:43.720
absurd foolishness of Americans. And that's strange. I mean, sometimes when we when we come

32:43.720 --> 32:47.800
to America, we have to play the villains and it's only evil. And sometimes we can just say any old

32:47.800 --> 32:51.560
Ross and people will be like, Hmm, yes, very good. Yeah, I think it's I think it's benefited

32:51.560 --> 32:57.320
Milo Yiannopoulos, for instance. The problem simply is that Americans have not spent enough

32:57.320 --> 33:05.400
time around dumb English people. Yes, yes. I think honestly, a week in London is a cure.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.400
A week in London is a cure. A week in London may be a cure for many things and it's

33:10.680 --> 33:15.640
many others. Yeah, I moved to London from the north nine months ago and I'm still getting used

33:15.640 --> 33:25.160
to it really. It's a terrible place. But so to me, that is this idea, part of the idea

33:25.720 --> 33:34.600
that we have online that debate is the like, ultimate. It's kind of is this, this,

33:34.600 --> 33:40.120
this fetishistic thing that is the arbiter of truth. I think it comes from the effectiveness

33:40.120 --> 33:46.840
of the sort of last movement of sort of intellectuals that were popular on the internet,

33:46.840 --> 33:51.400
the fact that debate was used to create advantage by people like Dawkins and Hitchens.

33:52.520 --> 33:57.400
Yeah, that's a good point. And maybe not just in the sort of argumentative sort of establishing

33:57.400 --> 34:01.240
truth sense, but also in the rhetoric sense, because Hitchens, yeah, he could he could turn

34:01.240 --> 34:07.720
a phrase. And so that's maybe that's interesting that it's that it's maybe come out of that to a

34:07.720 --> 34:13.880
certain extent. Where do you think it'll go then? I don't know, but I think it looks bad.

34:16.040 --> 34:22.280
We talked about like, it seems to be going in this Schmidian direction, right? Like, it seems that

34:24.680 --> 34:29.080
that people alleging themselves to be rationalists have kind of, again, applied

34:29.080 --> 34:35.640
what they think of as rationalism to white nationalist rhetoric in a naive way and have

34:36.600 --> 34:41.000
come to be sort of sympathetic towards it. Whereas, you know, and I think this has to

34:41.000 --> 34:48.040
do with the way that that, so this is the most generic imaginable leftist talking point that

34:48.040 --> 34:55.720
I'm about to repeat, but like the way that state or systemic violence or pressure or coercion

34:55.720 --> 35:02.200
tends to go unseen, whereas any rupture with that tends to look like chaos and violence.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.760
So, I mean, you have things to be violent against the backdrop.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.800
Again, you're mentioning the fact that in a clash with Antifa and the police, like,

35:10.760 --> 35:14.840
nine out of 10 people are going to see horrible Antifa thugs against an agent of law and order.

35:16.120 --> 35:22.600
And I think that the same is true. This is something I, this is something that I sort

35:22.600 --> 35:27.480
of want to explore in a future video. But I think that oftentimes in debate, you know,

35:27.480 --> 35:33.160
if you put a slick white nationalist with a, I don't know, a Jewish person or a black person

35:33.160 --> 35:43.240
or gay person, and the white nationalist sits there talking about peaceful ethnic cleansing,

35:43.240 --> 35:47.720
and like he simply wants a white homeland, just like everyone else is entitled to.

35:47.720 --> 35:54.280
And like, do you go to Japan and insist that they, you know, allow 45 million immigrants?

35:54.280 --> 35:57.880
Do you go to Africa and insist that only white people, that they have to allow all

35:57.880 --> 36:01.160
these white people? No. So why do you insist that we, you know, so they're making these

36:01.160 --> 36:07.320
kinds of like reasonable arguments. And then, if the Jewish person, the black person,

36:07.320 --> 36:12.280
the socialist, whoever is the other interlocutor kind of freaks out or calls them a Nazi,

36:13.160 --> 36:17.720
the rationals or the liberals will see this, and they'll see like a reasonable person trying

36:17.720 --> 36:20.760
to make a point and this unfair person calling them a Nazi.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.600
If people only have like four minutes to make their points, the person on the other side

36:24.600 --> 36:29.240
doesn't have like time to sit down and go, look, here's like the history of the world.

36:32.200 --> 36:39.320
Yeah. And it's the blindness to the violence and the inherent in the idea of white nationalists,

36:39.320 --> 36:44.840
or the idea in which this is sort of fundamentally incompatible with meeting, two people meeting in

36:44.840 --> 36:49.720
an honest discussion. The idea that this person wants to purge all people like that from society.

36:49.720 --> 36:56.920
That's an idea that you can't really meet in a back and forth discussion on even footing.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.440
It's not something that can really be up for debate.

37:00.440 --> 37:05.320
It's a good question of values, really. Yeah, and very fundamental values. I mean,

37:05.320 --> 37:14.600
if you think that the meaning of society is not, you know, that humanity is not what unites us in

37:14.680 --> 37:19.800
society and we're not coming to meet each other on terms of humanity, but rather it's race,

37:19.800 --> 37:24.440
then you've excluded all people who don't belong to the race from even the discussion,

37:24.440 --> 37:28.920
from even participation in the society. And so that's it. The game is up for having discussion

37:28.920 --> 37:32.920
between those people. And it's not because the person called them a Nazi or because they got

37:32.920 --> 37:39.400
emotional. It's because the race or ethno-nationalist's ideas fundamentally

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
involve the exclusion of that person from politics.

37:42.760 --> 37:47.080
Well then, all right. I like the way I just put that better than I ever

37:47.080 --> 37:51.000
said it on the roaming millennial thing. I wish I'd copy that.

37:52.120 --> 37:57.640
I guess to put it on its head then, because I can anticipate what some of my commenters might say.

38:00.600 --> 38:05.240
Your great video, the debate between the hard land left and the bougie liberal,

38:05.240 --> 38:10.520
was if we go into it thinking that there definitely has to be violence,

38:10.520 --> 38:16.440
then it's a foregone conclusion. I suppose if we start saying things like,

38:17.000 --> 38:21.720
this is going to sound really bad, but if we start saying things like there are certain people that

38:21.720 --> 38:26.600
we can't debate with, again, I guess the question becomes is how do we know which ones they are?

38:27.480 --> 38:30.840
I think that's the question that a lot of my commenters will ask. I think my answer to that

38:30.840 --> 38:38.120
might be that, well, that forces us to engage with the idea that actually probably at a bottom

38:38.120 --> 38:43.160
level all politics involves violence of some kinds, so it probably forces us to engage with,

38:43.160 --> 38:47.400
okay, who are the targets of our violence and why? It forces us to see the end of our

38:47.400 --> 38:50.520
own ideological noses, I suppose, whereas normally we don't look at them.

38:51.960 --> 38:55.560
Yeah, because there's a sense that any kind of politics that we have will be

38:55.560 --> 39:01.400
exclusionary in some way. That doesn't mean they're all equal.

39:05.880 --> 39:11.800
But it has to do with who you're excluding. The norms of a liberal society or a society based on

39:14.040 --> 39:21.800
free speech, free values, based on separation of church and state, based on all these things,

39:21.800 --> 39:26.680
this involves exclusion. So, for instance, in the US the separation clause is supposed to exclude

39:26.680 --> 39:34.360
religion from politics in such a way that anyone who wants to make an argument about policy based

39:34.360 --> 39:41.560
on their religious convictions, that's excluded. That's off the table. I'm making this as a John

39:41.560 --> 39:49.560
Rawls point. You're not in the realm of public reason anymore, I guess, if you want to argue

39:49.560 --> 39:52.920
from religious faith. It's interesting because we don't have that in the UK.

39:55.160 --> 40:01.720
I guess it's a specifically American idea. If that's only in this election that's going

40:01.720 --> 40:06.040
on at the moment, the leader of the liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, was getting brought

40:06.040 --> 40:10.360
up on the idea that he was saying gay sex is a sin and so on, and that gay people, he said on

40:10.360 --> 40:14.840
Twitter once, that gay people could be cured and so on. He was saying that based on religious

40:14.840 --> 40:18.920
arguments. Yeah, we don't have separation of church and state here. In fact, the head of

40:18.920 --> 40:23.640
state is also the head of the church. Yes, so I guess I should also clarify that, of course,

40:23.640 --> 40:26.920
in practice in American politics, there's religious appeals constantly.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.280
Yeah, explicit and coded ones, I understand it.

40:30.280 --> 40:36.440
Yeah, explicit ones. The philosophical idea, the John Rawls idea anyway, is that

40:38.440 --> 40:45.240
that's sort of not allowed in some moral or philosophical sense that you can't expect

40:45.240 --> 40:48.840
because it excludes anyone who doesn't share your faith. You're not making an appeal to the

40:49.720 --> 40:52.680
base of precepts that are supposed to be the things that we all agree on.

40:54.600 --> 40:59.000
I suppose it's an argument, interestingly, it's an argument based on a kind of personal revelation,

40:59.000 --> 41:05.320
I guess. It's an argument based on a kind of personal experience. But then we ourselves

41:05.320 --> 41:11.560
were saying only a few minutes ago that sometimes that some people base things on experience and

41:11.560 --> 41:15.560
that is very useful. So I guess what I would say what the difference is between listening to a

41:15.560 --> 41:19.720
feminist based on their personal experience and appearing at the appeal of a theist on the basis

41:19.720 --> 41:25.080
of a revelation has to do with the fact that I think a feminist can reasonably expect other

41:25.080 --> 41:33.000
people to give some credence to their personal experience. Whereas I think that a religious

41:33.000 --> 41:39.240
person sort of can't really expect people who aren't part of that faith to accept this as a

41:39.240 --> 41:43.560
valid reason. Yeah, and I guess also it's to do with the sort of ordinariness and commonality of

41:43.640 --> 41:48.600
experience. If somebody makes a video about how they've been cackled, then half of the world's

41:48.600 --> 41:52.440
population might be like, yeah, that's a thing that can reasonably happen. Whereas if somebody

41:52.440 --> 41:56.680
makes a video about having seen a divine vision in the sky, it's like, well, this is slightly more

41:56.680 --> 42:04.680
rare. Yeah, or at least the divine vision claim. Again, it depends on what kind of society you're

42:04.680 --> 42:10.440
living in. I'm sure in medieval Christendom, arguments were surely made all the time on the

42:10.440 --> 42:18.120
basis of divine revelation. Demons were driven from a pig today. This was considered a valid

42:18.120 --> 42:25.000
form of evidence, but because of the sort of philosophical underpinnings of our public reason

42:25.000 --> 42:30.040
and our discourse, our society, we don't accept that kind of stuff as valid reasoning. It's not

42:30.040 --> 42:34.440
universal enough. Only people who are in this specific faith will accept it. So it's sort of

42:34.440 --> 42:40.920
excluded from the discourse of democracy because it's simply too specific to a certain group of

42:40.920 --> 42:47.400
people. I suppose that might be why it's... So I guess one thing that follows from this,

42:47.400 --> 42:50.760
maybe as concerns a debate topic, is that if you're going to have public discussions,

42:50.760 --> 43:00.680
if you're going to have public debates, there's sort of rules that regulate what's allowed in

43:00.680 --> 43:08.200
debate. And one of those rules is that you have to sort of appeal to shared precepts in some ways,

43:08.200 --> 43:13.720
otherwise there's nothing productive that can happen. If you appeal to a basic value that

43:13.720 --> 43:19.800
someone doesn't share, that argument has no sway. Yeah, but also it's interesting sometimes that

43:20.680 --> 43:26.440
important matters can rest on facts that aren't always shared very equally. So I mean,

43:26.440 --> 43:31.640
maybe going back to that white nationalist versus someone on the left hypothetical thing we're

43:31.640 --> 43:35.480
talking about, the kind of white nationalist is banking on the fact that, and maybe

43:35.480 --> 43:39.160
reliant themselves on the fact that people generally are ignorant of a lot of

43:39.800 --> 43:47.640
facts of history because they just simply aren't taught. Like, I remember once I went on a walking

43:47.640 --> 43:58.600
tour of an Irish city, and we were taught all about the history of Ireland on this walking tour,

43:59.320 --> 44:05.160
and me and my English friends were like, what? We were just never taught this. It's just not taught

44:05.160 --> 44:10.360
in British schools, the extent of the horrors that we did in Ireland. And therefore,

44:12.440 --> 44:16.280
certain very important things don't come up in public political debates because of that. So for

44:16.280 --> 44:19.080
instance, when we had the Brexit referendum, people were saying, oh, yeah, we're going to

44:19.080 --> 44:25.160
close the borders with the EU. And it was not really, I saw very publicly acknowledged that

44:25.160 --> 44:29.080
to close the border with the EU would involve building a militarized border across the middle

44:29.080 --> 44:33.800
of Ireland, which of course, you can walk down the road being the EU in part to Ireland. And

44:33.800 --> 44:37.800
nobody kind of said, hang on a minute, haven't we built enough militarized checkpoints across

44:37.800 --> 44:44.760
Ireland? And so that kind of, that lacuna ends up really affecting the debates that are even allowed

44:44.760 --> 44:50.760
to occur, never mind that progress in certain directions. Yeah, so I think I guess I'm saying

44:50.760 --> 44:55.240
something, I'm trying to say something different, because I think that when you are not appealing,

44:55.240 --> 45:00.680
if there is factual information that you want to rely on, that's not widely known, you can always

45:00.680 --> 45:09.400
bring up these facts. Because, so, you know, it was Dublin, not Ireland before I get.

45:09.800 --> 45:15.560
Yeah. So for the, you know, an American equivalent of this would be, for instance,

45:15.560 --> 45:20.760
like people now, Americans are so bewildered as to like, why do North Koreans like hate us so much?

45:20.760 --> 45:24.440
Like, they're just crazy. But like, for some reason, they just hate America. And like,

45:24.440 --> 45:28.040
everyone forgets, like, no one really seems to have any consciousness of the fact that like,

45:28.040 --> 45:31.320
we went to war with them and just bombed the hell out of them. And like, hundreds of thousands or

45:31.320 --> 45:35.240
maybe millions of people died. And like, Americans just have never been bombed. We just have no

45:35.240 --> 45:39.560
conception of what that feels like. So we just assume, like, I don't know, Koreans are just

45:39.560 --> 45:45.320
crazy. Like, they, for some reason, they hate us. I don't know why. Like, why is that? But like,

45:46.280 --> 45:51.480
There are people in the UK, I mean, people in the UK say this about Islamic terrorism as well.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.440
They're like, oh, why? They just got so angry. And we have MPs who are like, oh,

45:54.440 --> 45:58.920
Islam is it? MPs at the MP level of the Conservative Party are like, or former MPs,

45:58.920 --> 46:04.440
people like people like Lord Tebbit are like, oh, Islam is incompatible with British values.

46:04.440 --> 46:07.160
And it's like, do you think it might have something to do with the Iraq war?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.200
You know, when we interviewed captured ISIS soldiers, and they're like, yeah,

46:12.200 --> 46:14.920
I'm doing this because of the Iraq war. Everyone's like, no, no, no, no, no, no,

46:14.920 --> 46:17.640
it's because the values and freedom, they hate our freedoms. It's like,

46:19.000 --> 46:22.520
revenge, revenge, renowned retaliation, you know, the three Rs. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

46:24.200 --> 46:29.320
Well, it's very easy to forget a war when it was not waged in your country. And when your

46:29.320 --> 46:33.400
people weren't drafted, and when, you know, so a lot of people made money off it as well.

46:34.120 --> 46:38.920
So like, I think a lot of Americans are too, with the Iraq war, we're just like,

46:38.920 --> 46:42.520
why is like, who still cares about that? Like, that was a long time ago.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.520
They're still dead.

46:46.520 --> 46:52.920
Just come back and respawn. Yeah, we're not, I can't speak for British curriculum as a whole,

46:52.920 --> 46:57.800
but I wasn't really taught about slavery in Britain either. Not our history of slavery.

46:57.880 --> 47:03.640
It was kind of, we had sort of 1066, Henry VIII, a little bit of Tudors, Elizabeth I,

47:05.080 --> 47:11.320
World War One. It's like, sorry, what happened in between that? What? Oh, what? Nothing happened

47:11.320 --> 47:19.880
then. We invaded the world and stole all their money. It's like, ah, there's that weird gap.

47:21.240 --> 47:24.440
And for the same reason, we don't do the French Revolution, because that was all happening at the

47:24.440 --> 47:30.040
same time. But I suppose with these kinds of things, you can at least bring them up,

47:30.040 --> 47:34.840
like you can bring up the factual thing. So that's maybe not like, it's not an absolute

47:34.840 --> 47:39.000
obstacle to discourse with someone because you can always bring this stuff up. I think where we have

47:39.000 --> 47:44.200
a more difficult problem is when there's a kind of fundamental value that you don't share with

47:44.200 --> 47:50.360
a person you're discussing. So I think one reason I find it difficult or impossible to have a real

47:50.360 --> 47:57.880
conversation with a Nazi, for example, is that I share as a kind of basic presupposition of my

47:57.880 --> 48:04.120
politics that human beings from different groups have equal moral worth as humans.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.640
I guess I shouldn't say that because actually I know that they're getting smarter about this.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.680
They say, well, we're not white supremacists. We don't think we're more important. We just

48:16.680 --> 48:21.560
think that we deserve to have our own thing. So okay, fine. We'll pretend that we actually

48:21.560 --> 48:26.360
believe they think that and go with their new thing, which is they think that society

48:28.040 --> 48:35.240
should only include people from their race or from the race. And if I don't think that,

48:35.880 --> 48:40.520
which I don't, there's almost nothing, like what can we say to each other to convince each other

48:40.520 --> 48:43.640
that- There's a lot of point talking about the hows and the whys and the wherefores and the

48:43.720 --> 48:48.920
economic this or that. Right. So we can sit around. What's going to happen if I debate

48:48.920 --> 48:54.120
Richard Spencer? Suppose I actually am trying to have a conversation with him,

48:54.120 --> 48:57.080
which I don't think I would ever try to do because I think that's a waste of time.

48:57.080 --> 49:03.720
But let's try to imagine how it would go if I did do that. How am I going to persuade him?

49:04.520 --> 49:10.440
We could start by talking about, I'm going to say, well, your plan to be peaceful and ethnic cleansing

49:10.440 --> 49:15.240
will surely result in violence or something like that. But come on, the fundamental disagreement

49:15.240 --> 49:20.920
is 25 steps before we get to that. But then you've granted him the idea that there's a peaceful,

49:20.920 --> 49:24.680
there's even such a thing as peaceful- And I've granted him the idea that

49:24.680 --> 49:28.600
peaceful ethnic cleansing would be something that would be okay to do even if we could do it.

49:28.600 --> 49:32.200
And even you've granted him the idea that that's what he wants, what he really wants.

49:32.200 --> 49:39.800
Yeah. So really the argument should start way before that, which is the idea that

49:41.080 --> 49:45.400
so I mean, and they want to state it as an empirical question, right? Like, oh,

49:45.400 --> 49:50.520
it's just a fact that diverse societies don't work or something. And they'll have evidence

49:50.520 --> 49:57.960
that's supposed to show that. So I guess you sort of can try to use facts to argue values,

49:57.960 --> 50:08.440
but often the facts are sort of off the main point. They don't think that they want an

50:08.600 --> 50:13.240
ethno-state because diverse societies can't work. That's not really the chain of reasoning.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.840
Yeah. I'm willing to put down a five.

50:17.960 --> 50:24.680
Yeah. It comes down to the fact that they don't want to share their country with people not like

50:24.680 --> 50:32.600
them in certain respects, right? And so they'll do what it takes. Every reason that goes to support

50:32.600 --> 50:37.800
that is ultimately kind of post hoc rationalization. That's the right post hoc, that was it.

50:37.800 --> 50:44.520
Yeah. And of course you can't prove the psychology of this, of course.

50:44.520 --> 50:50.200
No. But again, it's raining. It's good it's raining morning. It's like, what?

50:50.200 --> 50:56.920
Yeah. It becomes revealed to you in discussions. No matter how many times you argue that actually

50:56.920 --> 51:03.800
unbalanced New York City functions fairly well, despite the fact that it has so much

51:03.800 --> 51:13.960
ethnic diversity, they won't hear that. The subject, the conversation has changed.

51:13.960 --> 51:21.560
It goes to crime. And then there's a wearing down as well. Nobody has the resource to fill

51:21.560 --> 51:26.760
all these lacunas in history and facts and so on and to go through all the sources like someone

51:26.760 --> 51:32.520
like Sean and Jen does and to go through every single marker on that map of crimes.

51:33.320 --> 51:37.560
They did a great video a while ago where there was like a map of crimes committed by migrants

51:37.560 --> 51:41.880
in Germany. And they went through every single one of them and was like, this is listed as arson.

51:41.880 --> 51:45.160
There's a guy burning his toast. This is a different time. And they went through every

51:45.160 --> 51:50.840
single one, but not everyone has the time to do that. Yes. And it's exhausting and difficult and

51:50.840 --> 51:54.520
grueling to go through and debunk everything. And it's ultimately kind of pointless.

51:54.520 --> 51:58.040
And it has absolutely no effect on the people who believe that.

51:58.040 --> 52:08.200
Yeah. How do you see debate being sort of fetishized on YouTube? Because I see,

52:08.200 --> 52:13.720
I get a lot of comments who are like, oh, you wouldn't reply to my comment. Why don't you

52:13.720 --> 52:18.440
debate me? I'm like, yeah, that's not a debate. That's just a chat, you know?

52:19.480 --> 52:25.320
Well, a lot of these demands that we get to debate are simply like people who,

52:26.280 --> 52:30.440
you know, because I've often had people respond to my comment, respond to my comment, respond to

52:30.440 --> 52:38.360
them. And if what I say is effective enough, they didn't delete all the comments. So it's bait. It's

52:38.360 --> 52:44.120
what it is. It's bait to get you to engage. But I have had some very increasingly rare now.

52:44.120 --> 52:49.000
But some of my favorite moments on YouTube is when I get comments of people who are like,

52:49.080 --> 52:55.320
really angry. Like, oh, why did you say this? Like, fuck you. And then I go, that's interesting.

52:55.320 --> 52:58.280
Tell me more about this. And then some of my favorite moments are when they then come back

52:58.280 --> 53:01.880
and they go, I was angry when I said that. I'm sorry. I don't agree with you, but I see where

53:01.880 --> 53:05.000
you're coming from. So I really like those engagements. But you're right. I mean, all

53:05.000 --> 53:11.240
too often people just, they just want validation, not attention. But there's something like

53:11.240 --> 53:15.480
that that they're after. Is it an attachment to our time?

53:15.480 --> 53:21.000
Yes. Yeah. Oh, well, online is right. I got emails from like, just like egg accounts on

53:21.000 --> 53:24.520
Twitter being like, debate me on my podcast. Like, will you come debate me on my podcast?

53:24.520 --> 53:29.720
I'm like, what podcast? Who are you? Like, do you? Why? Like, why? Why would I do that?

53:29.720 --> 53:34.280
You know what I mean? Like, it's weird entitlements demand that you

53:34.280 --> 53:38.520
It's slightly, slightly cruel. But sometimes when when I get that, I just I just quote them

53:38.600 --> 53:40.040
my sort of hourly tuition rates.

53:42.600 --> 53:50.600
Yes. Also, I want to be cautious not to get too I mean, we get worn down and on the idea

53:50.600 --> 53:54.920
of engagement and become very cynical about it, I think. But I want to be careful not to get too

53:54.920 --> 53:59.160
down on the idea of engagement too. Because as you said, like you do have these interactions

53:59.160 --> 54:02.440
where someone later comes to you and says like, Oh, I was angry when I said that. And it seems

54:02.440 --> 54:05.640
that they actually have thought about what you said. They actually have thought about what they

54:05.640 --> 54:10.040
said in the sort of like, this kind of reconsidering has happened. So I definitely

54:10.040 --> 54:15.720
have moments like that. And although I think overwhelmingly, the response that I get to doing

54:16.280 --> 54:21.000
debates or conversations is just utter uselessness. You know, like, I'm like, put, you know,

54:21.880 --> 54:27.080
the, you know, look at look at the comments on, you know, my debates with Blair roaming millennial

54:27.080 --> 54:32.280
and you it's a lot of like, why should I take this disgusting training seriously? It's a lot of,

54:32.280 --> 54:36.440
you know, just this guy. It's like, wow, I'm really this is really productive here, isn't it?

54:36.440 --> 54:42.120
But then you also get I also get an often in private for some reason, the nicer things are

54:42.120 --> 54:47.320
said in private, ugly things are said in public. I don't know why this is, but it often is the case.

54:47.320 --> 54:50.040
But I'll have private messages from people who say that actually, like,

54:51.400 --> 54:55.000
they find the whole thing to be incredibly eye opening and like revelatory and like,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.200
and so it's like, okay, well, if some people if some people are getting something like,

54:59.080 --> 55:03.720
Hmm, and I suppose if the idea is that everyone should have their say, and that's coming from

55:03.720 --> 55:08.520
a place of compassion, then that's good. Like long may we all nurture those compassionate

55:08.520 --> 55:12.680
impulses, even if Yeah, even if it is the case that Nazis will try and take advantage of them.

55:14.280 --> 55:17.800
Yeah, that's not it's not all become too worn down and cynical.

55:18.440 --> 55:23.880
So I guess, yeah, I guess there can be there's really can be a positive effect of debate. I

55:23.880 --> 55:29.560
think it's just a matter of being of choosing who you debate with intelligently. So I

55:29.560 --> 55:33.480
Which is a question that, you know, that's, that's not exactly ready. That's a living the

55:33.480 --> 55:38.440
questions kind of thing. Yes. And so how do you choose? I mean, so I feel like I'm already getting

55:38.440 --> 55:46.680
smarter about this. I would never debate Blair White again. Because I think that she's, she

55:46.680 --> 55:50.760
doesn't care about what I say, and she doesn't care about what's true. I think that too much

55:50.760 --> 55:55.800
of what her focus on is, like I said, I mean, she's a bully, she recently tweeted,

55:55.800 --> 55:58.760
I never claimed not to be a bully. So I take it that she won't object to my calling her

55:58.760 --> 56:03.800
bullies. She's she's never claimed not to be one allegedly, we now hear but so okay,

56:03.800 --> 56:09.000
she's a self professed self without bully. So why bother with that? Like, why? Why go subject

56:09.000 --> 56:14.680
yourself to that. But I don't regret the discussion with roaming millennial, even though I think a lot

56:14.680 --> 56:21.240
of her audience is horrible. I think that she conducts a discussion in a way where something

56:21.240 --> 56:26.280
sort of I mean, even if there's not any movement from the two people involved, it's possible to

56:26.280 --> 56:30.440
have a conversation with roaming millennial in a way that people in the audience learn something.

56:31.720 --> 56:37.960
And that I think is valuable. That's cool. That's very cool. So it's a matter of Yeah,

56:37.960 --> 56:42.280
it's a matter of like getting a feel for who's worth engaging and who isn't. Yeah, yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.560
Looking at questions. Absolutely. And that's what I was gonna say was there.

56:48.600 --> 56:53.880
And yeah, I can't remember. Maybe they'll come back to me. Yeah.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.160
Let's see. Um, so

57:02.120 --> 57:09.880
I feel like we we wanted to say enough about the fetishization of debate. I feel like we

57:10.360 --> 57:12.120
keep touching on this, but without

57:13.960 --> 57:17.800
Well, I can't I can't speak for you. But I get a lot of commenters who are like,

57:17.800 --> 57:22.040
yeah, use the word debate when it seems like well, that's not a debate. It's a chat.

57:22.040 --> 57:25.800
Or you know what, it's not a debate. So is there a discussion? What's the

57:25.800 --> 57:28.040
distinction, I guess, between a debate and a discussion?

57:28.600 --> 57:33.560
Oh, well, to my mind debate conjures up because I guess the experience of formal debating conjures

57:33.560 --> 57:39.000
up images of sort of time limits and opportunities for people to sort of have rebuttals and speeches

57:39.000 --> 57:42.920
from the fore. And it conjures up that image of suits and gowns really, whereas discussion

57:43.880 --> 57:48.040
just sounds like more like this, I guess. And yeah, more fun.

57:48.760 --> 57:55.880
Informality, a willingness to not so I think in a debate, I guess I would think you kind of

57:55.880 --> 58:00.280
your people who have opposed positions, one of you is committed to one side, one of you is

58:00.280 --> 58:05.160
committed to the other side. And your job in a debate is to represent the case as good as

58:05.160 --> 58:05.960
possible. Yeah.

58:07.640 --> 58:12.120
You say, oh, yeah, that's a good point. Like, yeah, maybe you're right. That you've lost like

58:12.120 --> 58:15.960
that's bad. Whereas in a discussion, that's great. Because that means it's like, yeah,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.000
now we share some common ground. You know, let's have another one.

58:19.880 --> 58:25.080
Yes. So I think right in discussion, the attempt is much more to kind of reach some mutual

58:25.080 --> 58:33.880
understanding. I guess I think mutual fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I think that people are often

58:33.880 --> 58:40.920
so as regards what the goal of the discussion is, I mean, I think only in the best case scenario is

58:40.920 --> 58:44.360
any kind of mutual understanding reached that doesn't often happen, especially when you're

58:44.360 --> 58:50.520
dealing with people who are ideologically very distant. But I do think that what sometimes

58:50.520 --> 58:55.000
happens more often than someone being persuaded in the course of a discussion is I know this is

58:55.000 --> 58:59.400
the case with me rarely in my mid discussion, am I going to change my view about something,

58:59.400 --> 59:04.200
but often I'll kind of a day or two later, thinking back on it, or like looking into

59:04.200 --> 59:08.920
something the other person said, think like, you know what, I am not exactly correct about that.

59:09.720 --> 59:15.720
Yeah, yeah. And so maybe that guy I spoke to at that protest, who turned his nose up so much,

59:15.720 --> 59:18.840
maybe he's now a month later, maybe he's a committed communist.

59:20.200 --> 59:24.200
I think that, yeah, I think that's such an important thought to have. Not necessarily

59:24.200 --> 59:29.560
he's a committed communist, but that some of the sense of futility that you have from

59:29.560 --> 59:35.640
these discussions, it feels more futile than it is, I think, because maybe that someone

59:35.640 --> 59:40.760
ends the debate by saying like, fuck you, Emily, that's the end of the discussion,

59:40.760 --> 59:46.920
and they go off in a huff, or you go off in a huff. But later, you may not hear about it,

59:46.920 --> 59:50.200
but it may kind of get into them and they might sort of refine their position.

59:50.760 --> 59:53.880
Like locker rooms or books that are written in a foreign tongue, absolutely.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.160
Yeah, exactly.

59:55.160 --> 59:59.160
Live some distant days there and say, yeah, see, the more I experience, the more I think

59:59.160 --> 01:00:06.200
there's wisdom in real life. Oh, that was what I was going to say earlier on. Do you see this kind

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.560
of, you said that you were kind of learning more better who to engage with and who not to. I

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:19.000
remember learning that relatively early on when I did my video on gender. There was a YouTuber who

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.480
will remain nameless, who made a reply video. I think you know who it is. They made a reply video

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.880
to my video on gender. And it was hilarious because they quite clearly hadn't watched the

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.960
whole thing because they started bringing up arguments saying, what about this? What about

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:42.360
this? That I myself had mentioned in the video after the six minute mark. And they even, they

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:48.040
did it as a collaboration with someone else. And they clearly hadn't watched the whole thing.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.360
And they invented, they made all these points. And then I wrote underneath, I was like, but I

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.600
said that, like, you can't say that I missed this out when I explicitly said it. And then they were

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.520
like, inventing, like, what if a trans person heard what you were saying about gender? Like,

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.680
you don't need to invent a hypothetical trans person. I cited two in the video, like,

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.360
go read this stuff. Like, I think it's a trans person would critique Judith Butler on this. And

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:17.320
I'm like, I know, I said that, like, so after that, I don't, and to all those people out there

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.000
who I know some are planning to make reply videos to my work, and I know some of them make them

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.600
anyway. I don't really watch them anymore because I don't really find them that useful. Of all the

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:35.080
reply videos I've ever watched, about 20 seconds of one of them I found useful. And the guys,

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.840
I still don't agree with the guy. But that was kind of useful because I hadn't considered it.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.960
But the rest, I'm like, I just, I'm not going to watch it because maybe I'm missing out a huge

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.040
amount. Perhaps my commenters will be able to find ones that are brilliant. But I don't find

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.680
them all that useful on YouTube, particularly on YouTube. And yeah, listen to commenters and so on.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.760
But on YouTube, I think there's a lot of the performative aspects. They're kind of like,

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:04.040
oh, the pwnage in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, I agree that there's certain people who's

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.600
like, responses to me, I'll watch it two times the speed to see the first three minutes and be like,

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:18.280
okay, this is good. Yeah. Yeah. But I, yeah, so I think that, you know, you try to stay open,

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.360
but also if something is, I agree, it's a widespread problem of people just like,

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.800
grossly misunderstanding things that you say, ludicrous straw manning of your arguments, or

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.640
again, just giving evidence that they haven't even watched your video. All these are problems.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.960
And then also, just the, this is, yeah, you mentioned the video about like, you know,

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.440
skeptic destroyed your butthole, or whatever the comment that I was getting on these kinds of

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.120
comments. And so I kind of, yeah, I kind of want to go back to that, that idea of that video where

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:58.520
I talked about like, what I think the point of having a response video is, is it to destroy your

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.320
opponent? Or is it to try? So I think there's people who it's worth responding to. And that's

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.480
part of what I mean when I talk about choosing debates, is that because a guy like armored

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:14.200
skeptic, I disagree with him a lot. But in interacting with him, I get the sense that he's

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:20.760
sincere, that he thinks what he says, and that he's somewhat open to like, reconsidering things.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:27.560
So I think that's a person who's worth talking to. And I also think that in order to make the

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.720
conversation worthwhile, both people have to come to the conversation with the understanding that

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.880
the goal is a discussion where you're both somewhat curious to get a handle on what that

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.840
person says. Yeah, curiosity. And you're not decided from the beginning, time to wreck someone

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.600
like, yeah, like, one of the phrases that we are taught in the end drama school is full of wisdom.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.800
One of the things we're taught is curiosity, not ambition. Yes, great phrase, which is a,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.840
that's a lovely phrase that Yeah, yeah. So and there's ways that YouTubers can I mean,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.760
so this is my suggestion to YouTubers who want to make response videos is there's ways to do

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.240
response that don't involve pwnage. So if you want to make it entertaining, and I do this, like,

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.880
think of it in different terms. So I've used like, framing devices for response videos,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:21.640
like inviting the person to dinner, or, or like seducing them, which I think, like, sort of help

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.360
a little bit to subvert the idea that it's pwnage. Yeah, I see the rabbit mask in the background. I

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:33.800
remember that. Yeah. And so so, again, I think if people would look at these alternatives to

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.680
the wrecking way, there's a way of having these discussions that could go so much better than

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:45.480
they tend to go. Hmm. Yeah, because it could be fun. Well, again, yeah, pints, just go for pints.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.920
Yes. But I see people like Blair, like, you know, she'll have she'll she'll say, like,

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.440
oh, let's just have those people discussion in order to snag someone like me or Laci Green to

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.560
get on the debate. But then she goes back to her videos where, like, is there really there's no

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.560
actual like, there's no I've watched so many Blair White videos. I'm I'm so sorry for myself. I but

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:10.040
she she she does these like thing. I mean, is there ever a moment when she makes a video response

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.320
to Milo Stewart or to Riley Dennis, where there's ever an attempt at a genuine like human connection

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.520
or a genuine discussion in any way with the person she's talking to? Like there just never is.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.200
I remember hearing about Milo Stewart through your video on them. Actually,

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:31.160
do people still people still bully them? Um, yeah, it's not as bad as it used to be. But

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.120
yeah, they tend to stay away from a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's channels.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.040
Not where you're not losing anything. You're not missing out. Yeah. If you're avoiding these

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.800
bullying channels. Yeah. Just for you and PBS ID channel and a few others. Sean and

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:54.200
Jennifer cooking. Yes. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of channels not worth watching. I mean,

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.240
bearing my god, like this. I don't know if you know who this guy is. He's unfortunately,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.120
he's it's a kind of like bullying shitty response channel. Huge, like 300,000 subscribers.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:11.080
But he, I mean, so he did a response to my debate with Roman millennial where he what he did was

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.280
show clips of me and he deleted every single thing I said, except every time I say the word I think

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.000
and to me, and then he calls me a cunt and then you know, so okay, wow, like, and so you know,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.240
my advice to all feminists and social justice YouTubers in terms of dealing with bearing

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:33.560
is do not interact with him except as an actual brown bear, because this is the level that you're

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.520
dealing with. Like there's no point in engaging this. Like this is a bear in the woods to say,

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.120
you leave a comment saying hi bearing your big brown bear and then leave don't watch the video

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.640
because there's no point like that. If someone's if, like I said, discussion is a two way road.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.520
And if one person is not making good faith effort to discuss, don't you don't you there's no reason

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:58.360
for you to open yourself up. That's a waste of your time. Yeah, yeah. That's a shame that people

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.520
do that. Yeah, it's well YouTube is. I guess it's it's rewarded. YouTube is a shame. Yes,

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.760
I think yes, that slogan actually, it's not a corporate slogan. YouTube a shameful place.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.880
Yeah, I think that's the last time I went to YouTube Space London and that was on the side

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:22.760
of the building. Yeah. A shameful place. I quite like that on a t shirt. Yeah, but I guess I don't

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.400
know. Like I say, I think there really are a lot of people on YouTube worth engaging. So it's not

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.600
a matter of me being against debate. I'm not against debate. I'm not against engagement.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.640
I simply think and this is what this is the advice people gave me. And I didn't listen to it. I had

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:41.240
to learn it. I'm still learning it. But I have to I just I'm just someone like, I'm not a smart

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.520
person in the sense that I just believe people when they tell me things like I have to make all

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:51.800
every mistake myself like to play. I just I guess maybe it's a kind of I'm so such a rational

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:57.880
skeptic. I don't believe personal testimony. Every single mistake I must make on my own in order to

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.200
believe anyone about anything. So again, I had to I have to see for myself the liberals turn fascist.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.440
I had to see for myself who isn't who is and isn't worth engaging in. And yeah, I'm still in

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.000
the process of it. So like I said, I'll probably do more debates that are mistakes. And that's just

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.800
part of making those mistakes. It's just part of my learning how to do this. I think sometimes

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:22.440
with debates, there's a little bit of um, there's a little bit of a kick who goes madman about it.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.560
And I think I remember thinking this, I remember we really, really interested when I discovered

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.680
this story. So for those who may be watching who don't know, there's this fantastic story about

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:38.440
a lunatic who escapes from from an asylum. And he realizes that if he goes into town and just says

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.120
mad shit, then they're going to realize he's mad and they're going to send him back. So he's like,

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.880
ah, right. I will only say things that are uncontroversially true. And then nobody could

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.720
nobody's gonna lock me up for that. Like so he says, right. All I'm ever gonna say to anybody

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.560
is the world is round. So he goes into town and to every single person he meets like the world is

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.960
round, the world is round, the world is round, the world is round. That's all he says. And he's

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.440
right. Because it is. And they like pretty much immediately realizes realize that he's a madman

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.720
and they lock him up. And Kierkegaard told this story. And the point was, you can have all the

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:13.320
facts and all the truths and so on. And you can be like, technically true and correct, but still

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:19.960
wrong. If you've got the context wrong of why it matters. Walking around pubs saying the world is

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.960
round, everyone's gonna be like, what's wrong with you? Because yeah, you're right. But why?

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.800
Like, what are you saying? What's the act that's being performed here?

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.440
This is one of the things that you get out of studying philosophy, I think that like,

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.320
I miss them. So in a lot of ways, I hate interacting with other philosophy people,

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.040
not you, you're awesome. But like, a lot of academic philosophy people who are like,

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.320
especially like people who are like in the PhD route, you know, they get so involved in the

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.400
language of philosophy that they sort of lose the ability to communicate with a normal person,

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.000
because they've got this, this whole little technical way of doing it, which has some

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.920
advantages. But then when I go outside, and I talk to people with normal people, God, I suddenly wish

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:04.200
they knew philosophy of language. Because now, now there's this like, lack of distinction between,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:10.440
you know, no one, I think very few people have this idea that just saying a fact is not enough,

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.960
like a fact is always presented as part of a bigger chain of reasons, or there's different

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.480
ways of stating facts. And right, you can state the fact the world is round. And if it's out of

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:26.360
context, it could be wrong, or it could be crazy. Right? Like, like, like, two and two makes what

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.480
the world is round. It's Yeah, wrong, wrong answer, like correct, but wrong. Or like,

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.240
in my video on on white supremacist propaganda, like, I was so pleased when I thought of this

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.920
example, and example, I love you, which which can be said, like 100 million different ways and

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.120
always be true and always mean the same thing, but do something so different to the person

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.760
hearing it every time. And, or another thing, another thing you get me with maybe the white

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.480
nationalist thing is you'll have people point out, like, here's a list of all the Jews involved in

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.720
the media and all the Jews involved in politics. And it's like, okay, yes, all those people are of

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.440
Jewish ancestry, and all of them are what you say. But like, so it's not that it's not a factual

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.160
dispute. It's the way it's what they're saying with it. Like how, of course, when you when you

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:14.040
point that out, they go, but I'm just listing the facts. Like, you're the one who's thinking that

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.040
just because I made a list of all the people who live in the neighborhood of this ancestry,

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.320
you're the real racists. Yes, it's well done. We can all do the Russian reversal.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.200
And oftentimes, when you try to make these kinds of arguments, and this is again, the danger of

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.040
doing this on a public platform is I end up seeming like some kind of like, it's like the

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.000
sophistry of some fancy talking elitist by like, trying to like add this additional light, you know

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.560
what I mean? It seems like I seem like a weasel, or something for trying to get out and take

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.920
people's words and know what I'm going to do. But now that there's the tip of the iceberg,

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.200
and then there's everything else, like,

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.600
so again, you can imagine you can imagine having like a very an argument, a very belligerent

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.160
creationist, and the creationist wins the argument, because they, if you allow them

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.800
to lock you down with, so like, here's how this might go. Like, they'll say, like, can or cannot

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:08.120
a monkey give birth to a man? And you say, well, no, but and they say, aha. And like, you know,

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.760
but actually, these things are a gradual process over time, talking over time,

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.000
and like small genetic mutations. It's only over the course of millions of years. And he's like,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.960
this fancy talking liberal thinks you should believe. He won't give a straightforward

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:33.000
answer to the question. And like, so there's ways of arguing that make sophistication seem

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:41.480
like deception. Yeah, yeah. That makes sort of crude fallacies seem like common sense.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.480
Yeah, I suppose. There's something interesting in there about, just a half-form thought,

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.680
something interesting in there about education, and academia in particular being kind of gated

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.520
off to particular class interests. Traditionally, maybe there's something interesting in there,

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.800
but maybe that's another topic for another time. I'm happy to crack on with this and continue.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.360
Can we have a tea break? Can I make tea? Will that be terribly boring for everyone?

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.080
Or are we, or is there anything more?

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.720
Sorry, do you want to say you want to continue the stream but make tea or do you want to

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.840
just call it? I had this time with me. I mean, yeah, I'm happy to keep talking.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.880
All right, sure. I'll just talk to the chat while you do that.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.400
It's either this or, you know, write an essay on Brecht, but I'll be pottering around in

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:33.320
the background making tea. All right, sounds good. Tea break.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.640
It's the law, I'm afraid, in England. I can't go 90 minutes without tea.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah, he has no choice. It's the law of England. All right, I'm gonna look at the chat.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:41.800
How's everyone doing?

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.520
While he's doing well, you know what, while he's making tea, I'm gonna do a shot because

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.320
this is America.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:58.440
Shots! Oh, God, I'm almost out of booze. That's gonna be a problem because I'm supposed to go

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:08.440
talk to Destiny later about transracialism. I'm noticing all of you. All right, let's see.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.880
Evan Williams. A good American whiskey. It's actually a bad American whiskey,

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.200
but it's drinkable. It'll do. It'll do its work.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.440
It'll be like three in the afternoon for you.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.800
Yeah, it's three. It's almost four in the afternoon, but it's Sunday.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.360
Well, it's nighttime here, so.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.160
All right, well, I'm trying to think of a good toast. Someone proposed toast.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.680
I was thinking of doing an ironic hail victory, but I think I should not do that.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.320
An ironic Richard Spencer hail victory.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:47.820
Oh, dear.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.840
If I want people to take my... Let's not do that. You know what? Nazis are literally

01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:02.920
ruining me. I find myself... Their thoughts just infect my head. They're terrible, ironic

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.920
Nazism. It affects me. Not that I believe any of it, but it's just there. It's there in my head.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:15.000
I'm there trying to make breakfast or try taking a shower. I just find myself thinking about cucks

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.600
and thinking about cucking. It's just like, God damn it. I didn't used to think about this.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.520
The alt-right has done this to me. They've put...

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.960
Yeah, and I find even in acting there's not a lot of escape because the three

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.280
plays that might end up being our showcase at the end of the year are all about Nazis and fascists.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.840
Well, down with fascists.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.960
Yeah, yes, down with fascists. Absolutely.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.160
I say that without any irony whatsoever.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.360
My man, I've not had whiskey in ages. I've not had whiskey since I lived in Scotland, actually.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.280
Well, it's a good place for it.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:45.880
Yeah, absolutely.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.120
Evan Williams is not the smoothest of all whiskeys, I must say.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.160
Are you a single malt or a blended person?

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.160
I'm a blended person for purely financial reasons.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.640
Next time I do a Let's Play livestream, I think I'm going to start a whiskey fund

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.040
to raise some money for some decent whiskey.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.640
Fair enough.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.760
I think I'm relying on people who like whiskey to be evangelists.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.480
Enough about good whiskey that they'll pay me to drink it.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:25.640
This is one of the great things about whiskey people is that they're not satisfied with being

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.720
a whiskey person by themselves. They want everyone else to join them.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.400
And so you can exploit this urge as a means of getting free whiskey.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.680
Yeah, my friend John, the liquid guy on Twitter is a good whiskey drinker, I think.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.600
Now I'm all teed up.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.160
How is the chat? How is everyone?

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.200
They're doing just fine.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.720
There's not a whole lot of Nazis here.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.600
I must say, despite the common claim made by YouTube rationals that everyone has Nazis

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.160
in their chat, I'm not seeing a whole lot of it in my chat.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.640
I wonder what it is that I do to keep the Nazis away.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.560
Maybe it's not constantly sympathized with them.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:10.760
Is it Ollie or Ollie, says workers of O-L-L-Y, if you prefer.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.320
That'd be nice.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.000
I remember I used to go by Oliver, which is my real name, but my first ever girlfriend

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.560
told me that Ollie with a Y was cuter, and I've been Ollie ever since.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.920
Although my professional name is Oliver on acting credits, so I don't mind really.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.080
Oh yeah, Le Pen lost.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.400
I really should have been toasting to pen losing.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.440
Well, I guess I did.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.640
Down with fascists, yeah.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.280
Down with fascists.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.480
Down with fascists.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.680
Oh, that's relaxing, isn't it?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.280
What, whiskey?

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.960
Oh no, Le Pen losing.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.760
I mean, also whiskey, but...

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.240
Oh yeah, I guess, yeah.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.080
I really don't know much about Macron, so...

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.920
Yeah, he's not like a super great politician, but like my bar has sunk very low.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.800
Yeah, it could be worse.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.920
It could be worse, I guess, yeah.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.840
My French friend will be relieved, I'm sure, who makes fun of my terrible French.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.440
I spoke French in a video a while ago, and a few of my commenters were like,

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.400
oh, that's really great.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.000
And then my French friend was like,

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.840
you sound like an English soldier trying to chat up a French country maid.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.880
It's like, wow, how very specific.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.480
Yeah, that's an interesting thing for your mind to go to first.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.880
People are super chatting me to do another shot.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.840
I will do, because you did that, I will do one more shot before the chat is over,

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.120
but I'm going to keep my composure.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.200
Oh man, I wish I could have some.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:28.760
That'd be great.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.080
Well, that technology is not yet upon us, but someday.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.680
Someday.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.480
I'll stick with the tea.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.200
I don't even have any booze in my whole flat.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.420
Wow.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:40.700
That's all right.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.500
I woke up with a stinking thing over this morning, so I can do.

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:49.500
I had to go to a sword fighting lesson today,

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.180
which is the kind of thing you've got to do when you're an actor.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.900
It's like, oh, please slip and kill me.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.460
Can you please upload sword fighting videos?

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.700
Oh, oh, maybe.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.860
They'd be very dull, it's all very slow motion, yeah.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:07.420
Oh, I don't know.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.740
There's a lot of great European martial arts and

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.380
European historical sword fighting channels on YouTube.

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.460
Now, this is another topic that many of these channels

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.220
also have just the slightest tinge of neo-fascism about them.

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:28.540
Yeah, who was the guy you used to make videos about who kind of played Skyrim?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.300
The Golden One.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:31.920
Yeah.

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.740
What was that about?

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.820
Oh, Tom to the glory of Evan Williams, yes.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.620
Yeah, The Golden One.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.140
So he's a fascinating character.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.740
He's a Swedish bodybuilder who kind of does this larping Skyrim thing,

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:48.300
where he uploads himself playing Skyrim with his commentary,

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.420
and his commentary is gold.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:53.660
I mean, of all the fascists, The Golden One is my favorite.

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.020
I mean, he's actually entertaining.

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.780
I never thought I'd say this, but it makes me feel weird inside,

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:04.220
because I'm like, this man believes things that I think are monstrous,

01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:07.020
and yet I'm having a great time watching his YouTube videos.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.180
I feel like it makes me feel so conflicted and weird.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:15.660
But he's also given me the idea to play my own cock version of Skyrim.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.780
I guess it's a kind of penitence for enjoying his fascist videos.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.260
Skyrim, that's great.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.780
I love that idea.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.140
Oh, what's that?

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:28.940
You've got one video.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.540
I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:31.840
Hmm.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.020
I remember right back when I started,

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:39.340
I did a Let's Play series of a philosophy game called Socrates Jones,

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.140
which was quite fun.

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.340
Oh my gosh.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.540
I haven't done any Let's Plays since.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.180
It seems like everyone does them, so.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:45.680
Yeah.

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.500
I'm an absolute noob when it comes to Let's Plays,

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.740
but I'm streaming Pokemon on my live stream channel.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.340
I made a separate channel, by the way, guys,

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.020
if you want to check it out for live streams.

01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.860
This is on my main channel, of course,

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.980
because I think this is a stream,

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.220
which until recently had some serious intellectual merit.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.620
But I think that my live stream channel,

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.900
I want to, I just want a channel that I can just post whatever frivolous,

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.820
horrible nonsense that comes to my head.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:11.980
And so without offending my usual subscribers,

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.780
so that's the point of that.

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:14.380
Yeah, I should do that as well.

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.340
I think this is somewhere I might start a second channel for my acting.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:17.980
It's a lot of fun.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.200
Yeah.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:24.540
I think when a YouTuber builds up a certain fan,

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.940
you know, a fan base of a certain size,

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:30.300
you sort of feel this like intense pressure before you upload anything,

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.980
because you're like, oh, I don't want to disappoint people.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.740
This has to be up to my standards of quality.

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.620
And so it's a great liberation to just make a new channel and be like,

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.980
oh, I can do whatever I want.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.780
Yeah, I don't experience that.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.140
But then I'm quite shit, so.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.540
Well, I don't think you're that shit.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.460
I think your videos are actually pretty well produced and thought out.

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.460
And I think you have more subscribers than I do.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.500
I mean, I think that.

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.860
Not for long.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.020
Well, I don't know.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:57.520
We'll see.

01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:04.220
But yeah, it's psychologically good for me to have a channel where I'm like,

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.300
I don't care if I don't care what happened from this channel.

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:08.160
Yeah.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:13.020
Yeah, I kind of have to fit it around drama school,

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.900
which is like half five in the morning till sort of six at night every day.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.460
So this is like the school is like a full time thing for you now.

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:18.960
Yeah.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.200
I graduate in September and then I'll be I'll be an actor living in London.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:23.700
Wow.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.720
Living the dream.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.000
Amazing thing.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.320
That's why I'm kind of learning to swing swords and

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:34.160
ride horses and all the rest of it, because which is a lot of investment and time.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.400
But my casting is Shakespeare and period dramas.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.280
And doing that on TV would be great.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.960
But if I can't swing a sword and ride a horse,

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.840
then all I'm going to be doing is opening the door to the character and saying that.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.200
And that'll be my only role.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.720
Whereas if I can ride the horse and swing the sword,

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.240
then I can be Henry the fifth, you know?

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:50.740
Yes.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.000
Well, I think you'd be great.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.280
Oh, thank you.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.080
It's not just the beard.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.480
Thank you very much.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.960
So you're interested in TV or stage or both?

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.360
Anything.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.200
I'll do any of it because I love it all so much.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.600
Yeah, I've acted since I was very little and I would do anything they would let me do.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.580
Yeah.

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:10.880
What about you?

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.720
You're YouTube full time now, aren't you?

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.320
Yeah, this is this is it.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.720
This is all I'm doing is YouTube every day, all day.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.200
That's funny.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.000
It's amazing.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.280
I love it.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.160
I wouldn't trade it for anything else.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.000
It's a lot of Nazis though.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.840
But it's a lot of Nazis, granted.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
More Nazis than most jobs.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.840
I mean, I'm working at least I'm working harder than I was when I was a PhD student.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.240
But I'm more happy than I was.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.000
That's great.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.440
So I mean, what I would say to people who want to be full time YouTubers is

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.160
get ready to work like a corporate lawyer in terms of the hours you're putting in.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.160
It's so much more fun than being a corporate lawyer.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.600
So there's that advantage.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.000
But also, like, anything that you do.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
This is something I realized, like, I made some money, some actual money last weekend

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:58.880
streaming Pokemon.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.760
And I was like, huh, maybe I could be one of these professional video game streamers.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.640
But the thing is that, like, anything that's work becomes work.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.680
Like, and those guys, I say guys, because they're just mostly guys.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.960
They're women who do it, too.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:17.360
But those guys who are professional streamers, they're doing like, 11 hours a day of this

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:17.680
stuff.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.360
And I mean, you know, okay, so they're playing video games for a living.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.280
I'm sure they love it and wouldn't trade it for anything.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.280
But there's got to be days where they're like, I don't feel like playing Call of Duty today,

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.120
but I have to to pay the gas bill.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.280
And I just play Scrabble once in a while.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:31.920
Yeah.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.440
Just long for reading.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.840
Yes, yes, exactly.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.800
I kind of long for reading.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.560
I don't get to read that much anymore.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:43.520
Because, yeah, I just don't have time.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.120
Yeah.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.440
I mean, I'm very lucky that the fans sometimes buy me books from my Amazon Wishlist.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.080
I have a big pile of them stacked up at the moment.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.840
I suppose I don't have much time to read because drama school is getting very intense in the

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.400
final term.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.520
But yeah, I'm reading and you, in fact, you, the laptop are currently stacked on top of

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.320
a few books.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.320
One of which is Marjorie Garber's, what is it?

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.360
Vested Interests, which is all right.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.160
It's kind of slow going.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.520
I'm reading that and I'm also reading, I got it for my birthday, Vladimir Nabokov's Arda,

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.200
which is good, but it's kind of long.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.360
So it's slow going, but then I have a little long tube journey.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.060
Yeah.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.000
The year before I started doing this channel, I was trying to, my initial idea was I was

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:28.720
going to write fiction.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.640
That was what I thought I wanted to do when I left grad school.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.280
That's great.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.320
And yeah, great.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.160
But it's not like, man, if you want that as a career, like, God help you.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.280
Yeah, it's very difficult.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.440
I eventually gave up on it, but I was reading so much because I was just doing jobs to get

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:45.600
by.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.760
So I was an Uber driver in Baltimore, also horrible, horrible job, never do it.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.360
I was like a copy editor.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.760
I taught a couple of classes, but I, you know, just worked enough to pay the rent and I had

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.800
a ton of time to read.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.320
So I read all these classic novels.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.120
I read Moby Dick.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.000
I read Middlemarch.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.320
I read just things that I will never, I'll probably never have a year of my life that

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.480
has so much ambitious reading in it starting now, which in some ways is too bad because

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.480
I feel like reading all this stuff, it does, like, it expands your mind.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.600
It's actually good for you.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.720
I missed reading fiction.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.160
I don't get to read, I don't really love fiction, which is why this person got me harder and

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.160
why I'm working my way through 20,000 weeks under the sea as well.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.300
Yeah.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:29.840
Yeah.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.120
I miss reading fiction.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:31.780
Yeah.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:34.720
I'd like to do it.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:38.560
I just, I mean, I guess I could, I could make time if I really wanted to.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.760
It would be less tweeting.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.120
Tweeting is the thing that's got to go.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.480
I spent so much time tweeting.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:42.720
Yeah.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.560
I deleted Twitter off my phone a while ago.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.120
Yeah.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.800
And it's the future.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.760
It's amazing.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.240
Yeah.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.960
I've still got it on my laptop, so I can do all the kind of tweeting I need to do for

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.440
the channel.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.680
But yeah, I got rid of it on my phone.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.120
I'm like, oh, I can see birds.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:57.680
It's amazing.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:58.740
Yeah.

01:26:59.280 --> 01:26:59.780
Yeah.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:05.040
We had a thing on the course called living history where we go and we live in the 17th

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:10.960
century in character for a week, basically, but obviously no Twitter.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:14.960
And everyone came back from that and was like, yeah, I'm deleting all this social media off

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.440
my phone.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.360
And I was like, yeah, we're doing that too.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:17.860
It was good.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.520
Very good detox.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.680
Someday I may well have to hit you up to do some Shakespearean stuff on my channel.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.680
Oh, please, please do.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.720
I would love to.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.120
Yeah, I think that'd be a lot of fun.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.440
I used to have a second channel called Shakespeare Vlogs where I would vlog in character of Shakespeare.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.320
Oh my gosh.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.520
And it would start off as Hamlet being like, oh, I'm really sad about my day and blah,

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:37.840
blah, blah.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.440
But then it would go into reverse.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.280
Why is this not in my life?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.160
I'm probably going to bring it back once I stopped it just before I started my training

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.640
because I thought, okay, I'm getting better, but I might get into bad habits if I don't

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.360
have any guidance.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.960
So I think over the summer, hopefully, hopefully, and now that I've said it on the live stream,

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.920
of course, people will hold me to it.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.840
Hopefully, over the summer, I'd like to bring that back under some kind of guise because

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.560
that was a lot of fun.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.360
And it's all practice towards the acting as well, which is good.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.080
It's good stuff.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:04.480
But yeah.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.560
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.960
I think that I can definitely imagine there being an audience for it.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.720
One thing that's fascinating is even though people, I feel, don't read that much these

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.080
days, fiction is kind of pretty marginal as an art form.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.120
You know, this is something I noticed when I was trying to write and read it is that

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.640
contemporary fiction is a very specialized area where I think most people are sort of

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.840
not plugged into it.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.640
But people love Shakespeare still.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.080
They just love it.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.320
And I'm not sure why exactly.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.280
I mean, obviously, it's great, but lots of things are great, and people don't love those

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:37.680
things.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.360
You know, but people love Shakespeare.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.320
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.640
Milton is beautiful.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.680
People don't love Milton.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.560
That's true.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.040
That's true.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.000
I would love Shakespeare because I'm an actor.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.840
I have so many brilliant roles in it.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.760
And yeah, I could go on for hours.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:57.680
But yeah.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.840
No, I would like to do a Shakespearean channel.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.880
And if you ever need any Shakespeare, let me know.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.480
I almost definitely will need some Shakespeare.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:06.960
Oh, I'd love to.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.000
Super duper.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:10.240
Right.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.680
Well then, I suppose I really should write this essay on Brecht.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.000
All right.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:14.320
All right.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.480
Well, you can go write the essay on Brecht.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.600
Because someone superchatted me to do a shot.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.040
I'll do one more shot.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.960
Oh, I don't really have to.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.240
I just wanted to get you drunk faster.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.240
That's what it is.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.200
And then check out my Twitter later if you want to see my thing on Destiny.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.240
I'm going to go think about what I'm going to say to try to talk him out of this nonsense.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.240
What is it?

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.000
Or maybe he'll, I don't know, maybe he'll talk me into it.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.640
I don't know.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.400
But so it's Destiny.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.080
He's a professional streamer.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:47.920
He's a really interesting streamer because he, I like Destiny because he's a guy who

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.080
he tells the story of having been quite a bit of a shitlord a few years ago.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:57.360
And he's since sort of backed out of those positions.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.120
And that's an intensely attractive thing to me because it makes me feel like I'm not wasting

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.080
my goddamn time.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.880
And also, I feel like to some extent I've moved in the same direction over the last

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:07.520
several years.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.120
So I tend to hit it off really well with him.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:17.360
But he wants to make the philosophical case that there's a good analog between transracialism

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:25.120
and transgenderism, which is something that is extremely frowned upon in social justice

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:25.920
circles.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:31.520
So I'm going to go and talk to him about it.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.200
But anyway, thank you.

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.760
Oh, I guess I'll do my shot now.

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.120
Oh, yeah, go for it.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.880
Yeah, down with fascism, down with a pen.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.560
Down with fascism.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.560
What a drink.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.680
Well, on that note, thank you all for tuning in.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.800
And Oli, thank you so much for...

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.800
God damn it, there's a kangaroo in this stream.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.560
Thank you, Oli, so much.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:03.840
My pleasure.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.880
Thank you so much for having me.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.760
It's been lovely.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.200
Yes, we'll have to do this again sometime.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.040
All right.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.480
Thanks, everyone, for watching.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.360
Bye, everyone.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:14.160
Bye.
