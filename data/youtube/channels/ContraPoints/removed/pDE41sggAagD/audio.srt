1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Oh shit, am I screen recording?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,840
How do I turn this off?

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
Look away.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Everyone look away.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,720
Don't look at this.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,960
Oh.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Looks like Behring has a video called YouTube's Coolest Trans Chick.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Huh.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
That's kind of weird.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
Behring's videos are usually anti-SJW screeds, where he mocks feminists for being fat and

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,360
ugly and dumb and retarded and gay and fat and dumb and retarded and fat.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
He's not the kind of YouTuber I'd guess would be down with the whole trans thing.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
But maybe I'm wrong.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Let's watch it and give him a chance.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,920
But first I gotta do something.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:22,240
Right, so Behring's video.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Let's take a look.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,400
Yesterday I caught up with Blaire White, YouTube's most awesome trans chick and fellow anti-feminist

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
shitlord.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Oh, Blaire White.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,160
I've seen her videos before.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,520
She showed up on YouTube a few months ago and made an interesting video about how being

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,120
perceived as a beautiful, young, skinny, white cis woman actually gave her certain privileges

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,320
that she didn't have when she was perceived as a man.

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,080
Then she made another interesting video where she recalled witnessing an entire feminist

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,280
psychology class laugh at a male student who had just shared his story of being physically

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
and emotionally abused by his girlfriend.

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,680
I know from experience that this kind of thing really does happen in some feminist

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
circles and I think it's important to call it out as the vile and shameful offense that

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
it is.

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,840
So I'm grateful to Blaire for stepping up and for having made those first two genuinely

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
provocative videos.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,640
But in the videos she's made since, she kind of jumped on the feminism is cancer bandwagon

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,360
and I lost interest after that.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,880
But anyway, let's see what she has to say to Behring.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Tell me, what is your take on the bathroom talk, North Carolina, all that shit?

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
I think it's a huge mess.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,040
I think that people tend to care about it a whole lot more than trans people actually

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
do.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,120
In my mind, if you're trans and you're really making an effort to look the part and to live

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,520
the life, then you're not going to have that issue regardless.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,280
So if you're really making the effort to look the part, then it's no problem that North

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,040
Carolina legally requires you to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex on your birth certificate.

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,120
Well, that's not much solace to trans people who are still transitioning or who are unable

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,680
to present as cis due to their bone structure or other limitations.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,560
Pleasure wreath Simon ain't cheap kids.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,920
It's also no use to people who shun conventional gender presentation of their own volition.

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
But I already knew that Blair doesn't care for that sort of person.

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,960
Do you get much discrimination on say YouTube or in your day to day life?

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean, how much heat do you get for being transgender?

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Almost none.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,240
I don't begin all my sentences with as a trans person, as a trans woman, as a transgender

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
girl.

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Like that's not what it is.

55
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
Like, I just live my life.

56
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
It's really not even a thought.

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,320
I guess I kind of remember when I'm taking my hormones, but other than that I don't think

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
about it.

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,280
Well, it's pretty easy to not think about it when the world treats you like a cis person.

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,400
But I am lucky enough that I can enter most public spaces and the world does interact

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,000
with me as a woman, not as a trans person or as a man.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,160
So I do think that I am in a position to discuss female privilege as it's afforded to cis women.

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,360
I'm glad that Blair doesn't face much discrimination for being trans, but I kind of suspect that

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
part of what Baring finds cool about Blair is that she isn't a victim.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Blair has said in other videos that she's trying to get away from the victim mentality.

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,000
The farther I get into my transition, the farther I stray away from that victim mentality.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
And I think this is an understandable urge.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,160
I don't like thinking about myself as a victim either.

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,320
I like to think that I'm strong and beautiful and nubile and in control of every situation

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,920
except when I choose not to be.

71
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,720
But it's a lot easier to get away from the victim mentality when you're not a victim.

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,800
Also we should recognize that fighting for fair treatment is not the same as having a

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
victim mentality.

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Blair recognizes that trans people are subjected to a disproportionate amount of violence and

75
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
discrimination.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,120
I am transgender so that does affect the rate at which I may or may not experience violence.

77
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
Violence does be at trans people at alarmingly high rates.

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,160
Doesn't that mean that trans activists have a legitimate cause and shouldn't be dismissed

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,360
as a bunch of whiny SJW crazies?

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm not saying that's what Blair thinks, but I am saying that it's the subtext of her video

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
with Baring, where Baring seems to admire her for not complaining about anything and

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
for responding with giggles when he asks questions that a lot of people might consider rude.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,680
How long did it take to start going titties?

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,280
What's the deepest voice you can do?

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,720
What's the deepest voice I can do?

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,320
Did you tuck your old fall between your thighs or did you...

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
When I was in high school and I got like a bus phone up, I used to do this thing where

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
I could put it up.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,920
You know, most of the trans people I know don't like it when us cis folks ask them about

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
their junk.

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,360
A trans person once told me that since it would be rude to ask a cis person a question

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
about their genitals, I shouldn't do it to a trans person either, and that seemed to

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
make sense.

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
But now I'm not so sure.

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
Now that I've been enlightened by Blair and Baring, maybe the next time I see a trans

96
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
person I'll say,

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,280
Hey tits, when did you get your pecker snipped?

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,680
And then if she gets mad I'll say,

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Can't you take a joke you SJW bitch?

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,080
Get back in your safe space.

101
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Am I cool yet guys?

102
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
Come on, tell me I'm cool.

103
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,120
I guess what's cool about Blair is that she's not easily offended, and in an age where everyone

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,920
is eager to take offense, even a man trying to cuck like me finds it kind of refreshing

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,440
when someone just doesn't give a shit.

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
And now you have this wonderful faggot!

107
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
That's what happens!

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
You okay?

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
We good?

110
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Yeah?

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Yeah.

112
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Darling, you can call me what you like.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Oh okay, there we go.

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Cool.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,600
But the problem is that this sort of implies that trans people who complain about discrimination

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
or who take offense to impertinent questions are not cool.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,540
It's like Baring is telling trans people,

118
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,000
You guys are cool in my book, but only as long as you look pretty, play by my rules,

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,560
don't complain about oppression and injustice, and don't get offended when I ask you about

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
your tits.

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,600
For Baring and the troglodyte faction of his audience, the perfect trans person is a person

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,840
who challenges as few of their preconceptions as possible, who never asks them to consider

123
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,920
their own privileges or rethink any of their prejudices.

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
And it's also just a lot easier for most people to accept a person who looks like this than

125
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
a person who looks like this.

126
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,120
But that's a point that's already been made pretty well.

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,560
By Blair White.

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,720
And while these are sort of frivolous examples, I do think there's something worth noting

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,320
about the quality of life that women experience based on operating through a society that's

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,120
just kinder to them, that's just more polite to them, that's just more welcoming of them.

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,680
I think this is worth noting, even if they are small things, because over the course

132
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,080
of a woman's life, I do think it affects their quality of life.

133
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,760
You leave the house and people are smiling at you and opening doors for you and genuinely

134
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,680
concerned with your well-being, it does make you a happier person.

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,880
I do think this is a privilege.

136
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,300
But Baring and Blair don't seem to think it's worth the effort to be nice to people who

137
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,280
are weird or different or retarded or fat.

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,880
And I know that I don't get to speak on behalf of trans people.

139
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm not trans and I don't know what it's like to be trans.

140
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm just an old-fashioned cross-dressing pervert, like J. Egger Hoover or Rocky Balboa.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm one of the ones who actually shouldn't be allowed in women's bathrooms.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Geez, I guess this is all kind of complicated, huh?

143
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,480
Makes me feel like I need a nap.

144
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Good night.

145
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,520
You're a beautiful brown bear, Baring.

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,160
A big beautiful brown bear.

147
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Where I come from, things happen to bears like you, Baring.

148
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,160
Bad things.

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
Real bad things.

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,960
What was I saying?

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,600
Oh right, I don't get to speak for trans people.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,240
But I want to be polite and accepting towards trans people, and it seems like the best way

153
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
to do that is to treat them the way they say they want to be treated.

154
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,080
I've been given some standard advice, like don't ask questions about genitals, don't

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,640
use words like tranny or shemale, don't call human beings it, and that sort of thing.

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,040
But when I venture into the YouTube manosphere, it's a whole different universe.

157
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,240
In my last video, I suggested that maybe it's not the best idea to tell transgender teenagers

158
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,440
to drink poison when you disagree with them.

159
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
But transgender YouTuber Persephone66 left a comment on that video telling me that I

160
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,000
disrespected her by inadvertently suggesting that trans people needed to be coddled and

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
infantilized.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,840
She also told me to get fucked in the urethra with a blowtorch.

163
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
OWWWWW.

164
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,400
I guess I don't have all the answers.

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
I can only do my best with the information I'm given.

166
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,280
And while I certainly don't claim to be a spokesperson for trans people, I don't think

167
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,640
that Blair White can be that spokesperson either.

168
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
It's pretty clear to me why Baring and his followers like her.

169
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,720
The woman is a downright sexy men's rights activist.

170
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,280
What's for a shitlord not to like?

171
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,440
But when the largest survey of trans people ever conducted reports that 78% of participants

172
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,320
have been harassed because of their gender identity, to treat a woman who by her own

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,360
admission has never faced any discrimination at all as anything but an exception to the

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,360
rule seems, well, kinda dumb and gay and retarded and faggot ass and gay and dumb and fat.

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
That's right, Baring.

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I said fat.

177
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
I mean, just look at yourself.

178
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
You're a big round bear, Baring.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Here's the big round furry bear!

180
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,720
