WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Oh shit, am I screen recording?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.840
How do I turn this off?

00:09.840 --> 00:10.840
Look away.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
Everyone look away.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.720
Don't look at this.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.960
Oh.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.960
Looks like Behring has a video called YouTube's Coolest Trans Chick.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.960
Huh.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
That's kind of weird.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.920
Behring's videos are usually anti-SJW screeds, where he mocks feminists for being fat and

00:27.920 --> 00:33.360
ugly and dumb and retarded and gay and fat and dumb and retarded and fat.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.120
He's not the kind of YouTuber I'd guess would be down with the whole trans thing.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.560
But maybe I'm wrong.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.560
Let's watch it and give him a chance.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.920
But first I gotta do something.

00:57.920 --> 01:22.240
Right, so Behring's video.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.240
Let's take a look.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.400
Yesterday I caught up with Blaire White, YouTube's most awesome trans chick and fellow anti-feminist

01:28.400 --> 01:29.400
shitlord.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.400
Oh, Blaire White.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.160
I've seen her videos before.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.520
She showed up on YouTube a few months ago and made an interesting video about how being

01:35.520 --> 01:40.120
perceived as a beautiful, young, skinny, white cis woman actually gave her certain privileges

01:40.120 --> 01:42.320
that she didn't have when she was perceived as a man.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.080
Then she made another interesting video where she recalled witnessing an entire feminist

01:46.080 --> 01:50.280
psychology class laugh at a male student who had just shared his story of being physically

01:50.280 --> 01:52.160
and emotionally abused by his girlfriend.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.680
I know from experience that this kind of thing really does happen in some feminist

01:55.680 --> 01:59.520
circles and I think it's important to call it out as the vile and shameful offense that

01:59.520 --> 02:00.520
it is.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.840
So I'm grateful to Blaire for stepping up and for having made those first two genuinely

02:03.840 --> 02:05.400
provocative videos.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.640
But in the videos she's made since, she kind of jumped on the feminism is cancer bandwagon

02:09.640 --> 02:11.360
and I lost interest after that.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.880
But anyway, let's see what she has to say to Behring.

02:13.880 --> 02:20.080
Tell me, what is your take on the bathroom talk, North Carolina, all that shit?

02:20.080 --> 02:21.520
I think it's a huge mess.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.040
I think that people tend to care about it a whole lot more than trans people actually

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
do.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.120
In my mind, if you're trans and you're really making an effort to look the part and to live

02:31.120 --> 02:33.520
the life, then you're not going to have that issue regardless.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.280
So if you're really making the effort to look the part, then it's no problem that North

02:37.280 --> 02:42.040
Carolina legally requires you to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex on your birth certificate.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.120
Well, that's not much solace to trans people who are still transitioning or who are unable

02:46.120 --> 02:49.680
to present as cis due to their bone structure or other limitations.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.560
Pleasure wreath Simon ain't cheap kids.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.920
It's also no use to people who shun conventional gender presentation of their own volition.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.920
But I already knew that Blair doesn't care for that sort of person.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.960
Do you get much discrimination on say YouTube or in your day to day life?

03:03.960 --> 03:08.000
I mean, how much heat do you get for being transgender?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Almost none.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.240
I don't begin all my sentences with as a trans person, as a trans woman, as a transgender

03:13.240 --> 03:14.240
girl.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
Like that's not what it is.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.840
Like, I just live my life.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.120
It's really not even a thought.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.320
I guess I kind of remember when I'm taking my hormones, but other than that I don't think

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
about it.

03:23.320 --> 03:28.280
Well, it's pretty easy to not think about it when the world treats you like a cis person.

03:28.280 --> 03:32.400
But I am lucky enough that I can enter most public spaces and the world does interact

03:32.400 --> 03:37.000
with me as a woman, not as a trans person or as a man.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.160
So I do think that I am in a position to discuss female privilege as it's afforded to cis women.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.360
I'm glad that Blair doesn't face much discrimination for being trans, but I kind of suspect that

03:49.360 --> 03:53.360
part of what Baring finds cool about Blair is that she isn't a victim.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.280
Blair has said in other videos that she's trying to get away from the victim mentality.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.000
The farther I get into my transition, the farther I stray away from that victim mentality.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.920
And I think this is an understandable urge.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.160
I don't like thinking about myself as a victim either.

04:07.160 --> 04:13.320
I like to think that I'm strong and beautiful and nubile and in control of every situation

04:13.320 --> 04:14.920
except when I choose not to be.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.720
But it's a lot easier to get away from the victim mentality when you're not a victim.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.800
Also we should recognize that fighting for fair treatment is not the same as having a

04:21.800 --> 04:23.200
victim mentality.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.920
Blair recognizes that trans people are subjected to a disproportionate amount of violence and

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
discrimination.

04:27.920 --> 04:33.120
I am transgender so that does affect the rate at which I may or may not experience violence.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.840
Violence does be at trans people at alarmingly high rates.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.160
Doesn't that mean that trans activists have a legitimate cause and shouldn't be dismissed

04:41.160 --> 04:43.360
as a bunch of whiny SJW crazies?

04:43.800 --> 04:47.600
I'm not saying that's what Blair thinks, but I am saying that it's the subtext of her video

04:47.600 --> 04:51.840
with Baring, where Baring seems to admire her for not complaining about anything and

04:51.840 --> 04:56.080
for responding with giggles when he asks questions that a lot of people might consider rude.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.680
How long did it take to start going titties?

05:00.680 --> 05:03.280
What's the deepest voice you can do?

05:03.280 --> 05:05.720
What's the deepest voice I can do?

05:05.720 --> 05:10.320
Did you tuck your old fall between your thighs or did you...

05:10.320 --> 05:14.960
When I was in high school and I got like a bus phone up, I used to do this thing where

05:14.960 --> 05:17.040
I could put it up.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.920
You know, most of the trans people I know don't like it when us cis folks ask them about

05:20.920 --> 05:21.920
their junk.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.360
A trans person once told me that since it would be rude to ask a cis person a question

05:25.360 --> 05:28.800
about their genitals, I shouldn't do it to a trans person either, and that seemed to

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
make sense.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
But now I'm not so sure.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.160
Now that I've been enlightened by Blair and Baring, maybe the next time I see a trans

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
person I'll say,

05:35.160 --> 05:39.280
Hey tits, when did you get your pecker snipped?

05:39.280 --> 05:40.680
And then if she gets mad I'll say,

05:40.680 --> 05:44.720
Can't you take a joke you SJW bitch?

05:44.720 --> 05:47.080
Get back in your safe space.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Am I cool yet guys?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.840
Come on, tell me I'm cool.

05:49.840 --> 05:54.120
I guess what's cool about Blair is that she's not easily offended, and in an age where everyone

05:54.120 --> 05:57.920
is eager to take offense, even a man trying to cuck like me finds it kind of refreshing

05:57.920 --> 05:59.440
when someone just doesn't give a shit.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
And now you have this wonderful faggot!

06:01.440 --> 06:02.440
That's what happens!

06:02.440 --> 06:03.440
You okay?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
We good?

06:04.440 --> 06:05.440
Yeah?

06:05.440 --> 06:06.440
Yeah.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.440
Darling, you can call me what you like.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.440
Oh okay, there we go.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.440
Cool.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.600
But the problem is that this sort of implies that trans people who complain about discrimination

06:14.600 --> 06:17.600
or who take offense to impertinent questions are not cool.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.540
It's like Baring is telling trans people,

06:19.540 --> 06:24.000
You guys are cool in my book, but only as long as you look pretty, play by my rules,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.560
don't complain about oppression and injustice, and don't get offended when I ask you about

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
your tits.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.600
For Baring and the troglodyte faction of his audience, the perfect trans person is a person

06:32.600 --> 06:36.840
who challenges as few of their preconceptions as possible, who never asks them to consider

06:36.840 --> 06:39.920
their own privileges or rethink any of their prejudices.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.920
And it's also just a lot easier for most people to accept a person who looks like this than

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
a person who looks like this.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.120
But that's a point that's already been made pretty well.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.560
By Blair White.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.720
And while these are sort of frivolous examples, I do think there's something worth noting

06:53.720 --> 06:58.320
about the quality of life that women experience based on operating through a society that's

06:58.320 --> 07:04.120
just kinder to them, that's just more polite to them, that's just more welcoming of them.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.680
I think this is worth noting, even if they are small things, because over the course

07:07.680 --> 07:11.080
of a woman's life, I do think it affects their quality of life.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.760
You leave the house and people are smiling at you and opening doors for you and genuinely

07:15.760 --> 07:19.680
concerned with your well-being, it does make you a happier person.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.880
I do think this is a privilege.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.300
But Baring and Blair don't seem to think it's worth the effort to be nice to people who

07:25.300 --> 07:28.280
are weird or different or retarded or fat.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.880
And I know that I don't get to speak on behalf of trans people.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.200
I'm not trans and I don't know what it's like to be trans.

07:33.240 --> 07:38.000
I'm just an old-fashioned cross-dressing pervert, like J. Egger Hoover or Rocky Balboa.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I'm one of the ones who actually shouldn't be allowed in women's bathrooms.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.600
Geez, I guess this is all kind of complicated, huh?

07:43.600 --> 07:45.480
Makes me feel like I need a nap.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
Good night.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.520
You're a beautiful brown bear, Baring.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.160
A big beautiful brown bear.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.880
Where I come from, things happen to bears like you, Baring.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.160
Bad things.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.640
Real bad things.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.960
What was I saying?

08:03.960 --> 08:06.600
Oh right, I don't get to speak for trans people.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.240
But I want to be polite and accepting towards trans people, and it seems like the best way

08:10.240 --> 08:12.960
to do that is to treat them the way they say they want to be treated.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.080
I've been given some standard advice, like don't ask questions about genitals, don't

08:17.080 --> 08:21.640
use words like tranny or shemale, don't call human beings it, and that sort of thing.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.040
But when I venture into the YouTube manosphere, it's a whole different universe.

08:25.040 --> 08:29.240
In my last video, I suggested that maybe it's not the best idea to tell transgender teenagers

08:29.240 --> 08:31.440
to drink poison when you disagree with them.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.760
But transgender YouTuber Persephone66 left a comment on that video telling me that I

08:35.760 --> 08:40.000
disrespected her by inadvertently suggesting that trans people needed to be coddled and

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
infantilized.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.840
She also told me to get fucked in the urethra with a blowtorch.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
OWWWWW.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.400
I guess I don't have all the answers.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.800
I can only do my best with the information I'm given.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.280
And while I certainly don't claim to be a spokesperson for trans people, I don't think

08:52.280 --> 08:54.640
that Blair White can be that spokesperson either.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.040
It's pretty clear to me why Baring and his followers like her.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.720
The woman is a downright sexy men's rights activist.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.280
What's for a shitlord not to like?

09:01.280 --> 09:06.440
But when the largest survey of trans people ever conducted reports that 78% of participants

09:06.440 --> 09:10.320
have been harassed because of their gender identity, to treat a woman who by her own

09:10.320 --> 09:14.360
admission has never faced any discrimination at all as anything but an exception to the

09:14.360 --> 09:20.360
rule seems, well, kinda dumb and gay and retarded and faggot ass and gay and dumb and fat.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.360
That's right, Baring.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
I said fat.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.800
I mean, just look at yourself.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.360
You're a big round bear, Baring.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
Here's the big round furry bear!

09:32.800 --> 09:35.720
If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.160
If you didn't like it, please leave a comment telling me what a gay-ass retarded white night

09:39.160 --> 09:41.680
man-gina cuck I am, ya fuckin' ding-dongs.
