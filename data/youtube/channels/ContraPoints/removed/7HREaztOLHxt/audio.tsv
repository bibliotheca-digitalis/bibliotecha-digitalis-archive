0	5000	Oh, looks like Lord Helmet has grazed my video with a response.
5000	7140	Who is this skeptical knight anyway?
7140	8840	This quizzical equestrian?
8840	12800	Wha-wha-wha-wha-where from does he get his ideas?
12800	17240	What kind of hideous neckbeard mug is lurking behind that goddamn helmet anyway?
17240	18240	Oh.
18240	20960	Well, that is a lot more attractive than what I was expecting.
20960	23720	Wonder what I'll have to do to get inside that armor.
23720	25920	Ah, so that's his game.
25920	27740	Well, that's certainly in my playbook.
27740	30420	Looks like Skeptic and I are about to get off.
30420	31420	Good boy.
31420	33460	But first, I'd like to turn on.
33460	38260	Skeptic, I think you'll find this video a little more interesting if you take one of
38260	39260	these.
39260	42140	So, here's one for you.
42140	43780	Open your mouth.
43780	47900	A little wider.
47900	49900	And one for me.
49900	59180	You're just gonna want to hold on your tongue for a minute and then just swallow it down.
59180	69620	And now, we wait.
69620	70620	Good God.
100620	115660	Before I get started, I want to take a moment to explain what I think the point of making
115660	117100	a response video is.
117100	120580	Whenever some knight of reason makes a video response to me, some of his followers usually
120580	124520	come rushing over to my channel to announce the triumph of masculine rationality over
124520	126260	my faggoty-ass panties.
126260	129740	For example, way to lump armored Skeptic in when he hasn't done anything on the issue
129740	130920	of Milo.
130920	134260	Now he ripped your asshole open.
134260	135800	Good job.
135800	139020	And Justicar just annihilated this video.
139020	144020	He went in on you like there was no tomorrow, as if we were on the brink of extinction.
144020	145020	Raw!
145020	146020	Unannounced.
146020	147420	No lube.
147420	153800	Just ripped your faggoty-ass panties apart and shamed all over you.
153800	157340	Is tearing your opponent's butthole to shreds really the aim of rationality?
157340	161140	I always thought the purpose of rational argument was communication, or even, y'know,
161140	164840	breaching some kind of mutual understanding, not just annihilating a human being.
164840	168340	Socrates wasn't arguing with the citizens of Athens because he wanted to blast their
168340	169340	butthole.
169340	170640	Actually, he did want to do that.
170640	173900	But wasn't there also a thing about, like, truth and justice?
173900	177860	Also, why is anal rape your go-to metaphor for winning an argument anyway?
177860	179620	What does that say about your values?
179620	183280	It reminds me of the internet term butthurt, which describes someone who complains a lot
183280	184500	when their feelings are hurt.
184500	186260	Just like a victim of anal rape.
186260	189500	And why do dudes who like putting their dicks in people spend so much time denigrating people
189500	191460	who like having dicks put inside them anyway?
191460	195060	Shouldn't they be, like, erecting monuments to these noble dick takers?
195060	198820	Anyway, the point of this preamble is that I don't hate armored skeptic.
198820	202820	If we met in person, I mean, it would probably be kind of awkward, but I'm sure we'd drink
202820	205420	some beers and talk things over and it would be fine.
205420	206600	Hello, Greg.
206600	209100	Your name is Greg, yes.
209100	211660	I am Nick.
211660	214540	Hello.
214600	216420	Try the wine!
216420	218000	The problem is this medium.
218000	221140	These goddamn savages demand a circus, and I intend to give them one.
221140	223840	But behind the curtain I really just want to have a conversation.
223840	226420	Not trying to tear Skeptic's rectum into a billion shreds.
226420	230900	I just crave human touch.
230900	232860	Why won't you touch me, mommy?
232860	234960	Why won't you tell me you love me?
235740	243440	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
244020	248180	So, if I were to make a full response video to Armored Skeptic's two-part video on social justice,
248180	251820	it would have to be a feature-length film, probably available sometime this fall.
251820	254480	So I'm going to concentrate instead on a few important points.
254480	256600	First, I do owe Skeptic an apology.
256600	260740	This whole exchange was set off when I included the following clip in my video about Milo Stewart.
260900	265360	Last week, a transgender teenager named Milo Stewart uploaded a YouTube video titled,
265360	269240	All Cis People Are Transphobic, and You're Probably Racist Too.
269240	271500	So, what do you think happened next?
271500	274540	How did the YouTube anti-SJW community respond?
274540	279300	Most of the people pictured here had not made responses to Milo, and I didn't intend to suggest that they had.
279300	283880	I was using their pictures as a kind of icon for this whole anti-social justice internet movement,
283880	285420	or tantrum, or whatever it is.
285420	288920	But I realized that in context, it does look like I'm specifically calling them out.
288920	293480	So using this image here was inaccurate and misleading, and I do apologize to the people pictured.
293480	297020	Baby, I'm sorry. I'll buy you an ice cream bar.
297020	300940	I do think it's important to publicly concede when you're wrong, distasteful though it may be.
300940	303820	But now that that's out of the way, it's time to go on the offensive.
303820	308860	Skeptic claims I've slandered him by attributing to him membership in the YouTube anti-SJW community.
308860	313920	Well, he just decided that we're all part of a community called the anti-SJW community.
313920	317880	I did not even know that this community existed before this video was posted.
317880	321680	I didn't know that anybody could be called an anti-SJW.
321680	323680	Could you please explain to me what that means?
323680	325400	Well, how about this for a definition?
325400	330400	An anti-SJW is a person, usually a white man, who posts video after video complaining about
330400	334800	Anita Sarkeesian, feminism, Black Lives Matter, PC culture, and so on.
334800	339760	In fact, if you unironically use the word SJW a lot, you're probably an anti-SJW.
339760	343880	I'm honestly amazed that you're denying involvement in an online community of some kind.
343880	347080	I mean, you made this picture! You tweeted it!
347080	352680	You're friends with these people, you're dating one of them, you tweet at them, some of them support you financially,
352680	357480	you make videos about the same topics, the people subscribed to you tend to also be subscribed to them.
357480	361280	If this isn't an online community, then I guess there's no such thing as an online community.
361280	363880	You seem to want to deny any kind of involvement in a community,
363880	368680	because it jars with your image of yourself as an individual free-thinking skeptic who reaches his own conclusions.
368680	370880	But can you at least recognize that you're part of a trend?
370880	374680	I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Human life is just communal by nature.
374680	378680	No one's really that original. Even geniuses are pretty easy to place within a movement.
378680	380880	Shakespeare belongs in the same group with Marlowe,
380880	383280	Jimi Hendrix came out of blues and psychedelic rock,
383280	387680	and where would the genius armored skeptic be without precursors like Thunderf00t and TJ?
387680	390480	Still, I guess I should be glad that you don't have more community loyalty,
390480	392680	since I am trying to persuade you to change your mind.
392680	396080	Unless, of course, you're right and I'm wrong, in which case I hope you change my mind.
396080	397480	There! I said it!
397480	400480	If you'd like to congratulate me on how nuanced I am, you may do that now.
400480	402680	So to get to the heart of my disagreement with Skeptic,
402680	406080	I guess we need to go back to the celebrated gender confusion, Milo Stewart.
406080	411480	Our disagreement is about whether Milo's claim that all white people are racist is inherently offensive and bigoted.
411480	414280	I got approximately 10 million comments on my video about this,
414280	418280	from people who claim to be deeply offended and upset and bullied even by Milo.
418280	423480	Yes, this Milo, the one who sometimes wears a dress, and sometimes spins around in a chair.
423480	424680	Whee!
424680	427680	You know what, guys? I simply don't believe that your cis feelings are hurt.
427680	430480	I know, because being cisgender makes your daily life so much harder,
430480	435280	and you're a little sensitive about this because of all the oppression and bullying that you've had to face as a cisgender person.
435280	438080	This is just a preposterous idea, and I'm not going to entertain it.
438080	441880	So look, what's the most plausible interpretation of the claim that all white people are racist?
441880	444480	Well, it's certainly not that all white people are bigoted clansmen.
444480	447280	This is obviously false, and we can dismiss it without further discussion.
447280	448880	Case closed. What's next?
448880	452080	Well, how about the idea that all white people have some degree of racial bias?
452080	455480	What about the idea that everyone has some degree of racial bias?
455480	459880	Oh, well, if this is a fact, then it should be very easy for you to prove, right?
459880	463080	Well, not necessarily. There are some facts that are very difficult to prove.
463080	468080	But in this case, the evidence supports the view that most people are susceptible to some degree of implicit racial bias.
468080	471880	In the description of this video, I'll link to a document from the National Center for State Courts
471880	474880	that summarizes a lot of the scientific literature on this subject.
474880	478880	Yeah, sure, bias sucks, but bias isn't inherently a problem.
478880	482880	Just because somebody has a mental bias does not mean that they act on it in any way.
482880	486280	Well, it's true that implicit mental bias is not itself a moral transgression.
486280	489880	It's definitely not something people should feel guilty about, and more on guilt later.
489880	493480	But implicit bias certainly can lead you to behave in discriminatory ways,
493480	498280	sometimes with very serious consequences, as in this case, animated by the Crash Course YouTube channel.
498280	502880	In February 1999, four New York City police officers were on patrol in the Bronx
502880	505680	when they saw a young black man standing on a stoop.
505680	507680	They thought he looked suspicious.
507680	512080	When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket.
512080	515280	He kept digging as the police shouted at him to show his hands.
515280	520080	A few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was dead,
520080	523680	hit by 19 of the 41 bullets that the police fired at him.
523680	526480	What Diallo was reaching for was his wallet.
526480	530680	He was going for his ID as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building.
530680	533680	There were also studies that showed that implicit racial bias affects decisions
533680	537480	made by doctors, hiring managers, judges, jurors, and voters.
537480	542080	These are pretty important decisions, so implicit racial bias in these cases is not just a trivial thing.
542080	545080	One of the dangers of being unaware or in denial about your own bias
545080	548480	is that you might be acting on the basis of your bias without even realizing it.
548480	552280	This is especially a problem since almost no one is explicitly racist anymore.
552280	556680	For an example of what I mean by that, on June 2011, a group of white teenagers in Mississippi
556680	561080	beat an innocent black man named Craig Anderson to death while repeatedly saying ****
561080	562880	and shouting WHITE PAR.
562880	565880	It would be hard to think of a more obviously racist event than this,
565880	569280	and yet, in the aftermath of the murder, the families and friends of the perpetrators
569280	572280	all agreed that none of these confused young kids were racist at all.
572280	574680	They just got caught up in a little teenage stupidity.
574680	576880	According to one of the perpetrator's boyfriends,
576880	580680	the news coverage is about trying to bring racism back.
580680	584080	This kind of stuff is what brings racism into the world.
584080	588680	I don't see the point in saying anything about race or involving race.
588680	592280	It just makes blacks hate whites and white hate blacks all the more.
592280	594880	The idea is that you can go and commit hate crimes
594880	597080	and then when people accuse you of being racist,
597080	600680	you say that actually, they're the real racists.
600680	603280	There you were innocently murdering black people,
603280	607280	and then a bunch of racists came along and brought race into it
607280	610680	by calling you racist like a bunch of racists.
610680	614480	This is an extreme version of the common claim that Black Lives Matter is racist
614480	617880	because they bring race up and create hostility.
617880	621280	I'm not even gonna get into how the Black Lives Matter movement is a regressive movement
621280	625480	designed to create an us-and-them mentality between the black and white communities
625480	628880	as well as keep black people in a perpetual victim class.
628880	632680	How are the people standing up for themselves and trying to change their situation
632680	635680	the ones who are keeping black people in a perpetual victim class?
635680	639080	Isn't that, like, exactly the opposite of what is true?
639080	643880	I guess the problem is that Skeptic doesn't believe there is systemic racial injustice in America,
643880	647680	so he thinks the protesters are crybabies whining about imaginary oppression.
647680	653280	It would require a separate video, or, you know, 500, to argue that there is, in fact, racism in America,
653280	658680	and maybe I'll make that video at some point if I see enough comments from people who don't see race because racism is over.
658680	660680	But that is such a stupid position!
660680	663880	Are you sure that's your position, Skeptic? Are you sure you don't want to change your mind?
663880	665680	I offer now is the time to change your mind.
665680	669880	Maybe do ten minutes of research on police brutality and mass incarceration before answering.
669880	674880	When you confront these people and ask them for proof that they're actually being oppressed or a part of an oppressed group,
674880	679280	they just tell you, hey, Whitey, you don't see it because you're part of the system.
679280	682280	But are you sure it's not true that you don't see it because you're part of the system?
682280	686080	It appears that you have the privilege of never really having had to think about race until now,
686080	690280	whereas a lot of people are constantly reminded of their race by the obstacles it puts in front of them,
690280	693480	and then you have the audacity to call them racist for bringing it up.
693480	697480	Now, race and racial tension is not something that I generally talk about,
697480	701080	mainly because it's not something I have a lot of experience with.
701080	703080	Well, that's pretty obvious from these videos.
703080	708080	You say the deepest rabbit hole of bigotry you've ever experienced was watching videos from Milo Stewart,
708080	712280	an indication that you have no idea whatsoever what it's like to face actual racism.
712280	717280	Now, to be fair, Skeptic is also probably referring to Ghazi, who actually is a racist crackpot.
717280	719280	Milo, you fucked up by citing this guy.
719280	722480	He is not a reliable source of information about, well, anything.
722480	723480	I mean, he's funny.
723480	725280	Jew, I am your father.
725280	727280	Jew, I am your father.
727280	729480	It's good, but he should not say the things that he says.
729480	731480	Maybe next time try Kat Black?
731480	733280	Incidentally, can Black people be racist?
733280	734280	Yes, of course they can.
734280	738280	But Black supremacy does not and ever has been a systemic threat to white people in America,
738280	740280	whereas the reverse is obviously the case.
740280	742280	So white racism is a lot more harmful.
742280	745680	Speaking of Milo, I think the best point in his video was this one.
745680	751680	The whole point of acknowledging that we're racist, transphobic, misogynistic, etc.,
751680	756880	is so that we can better recognize our biases and work to overcome them.
756880	759880	This is exactly what the NCSC pamphlet suggests.
759880	763280	Consciously acknowledging group differences instead of feigning colorblindness,
763280	764880	scrutinizing your own thoughts and feelings,
764880	768280	and exposing yourself to stereotyped group members in a positive context
768280	771480	are all ways to mitigate the effects of implicit bias on your judgment.
771480	774480	Although I can't definitively prove that everyone has racial biases,
774480	777080	I become skeptical when anyone claims to be immune to them.
777080	780680	It would be like someone telling me that they never recognize patterns where there aren't any,
780680	782880	or that they're never influenced by social pressure.
782880	787480	It kind of raises a red flag and makes me think that this person isn't very aware of their own limitations.
787480	789880	All of this applies to behavior as well as attitudes.
789880	793680	I agree with the Avenue Q thesis that everyone's a little bit racist sometimes.
793680	797280	Pretty much everyone has told a racist joke or made a racist assumption at some point,
797280	798680	and this does not make you a monster,
798680	802480	but these things can add up to have damaging effects, and they do reinforce biases.
802480	804280	You don't need to feel really guilty about it,
804280	806880	you just need to be aware of it and the potential it has to do harm.
806880	812680	But Skeptic seems really fixated on this idea that social justice warriors supposedly want him to feel guilty.
812680	814280	He brings it up again and again.
814280	818280	And just like feminism's greatest weapon is to make men feel guilty for being men,
818280	822280	these racially motivated groups will try to make people feel guilty for being white.
822280	827080	Trying to make people feel guilty by association for something that you can't even prove exists.
827080	832880	The most powerful emotion is guilt, and white guilt is very much a real thing.
832880	837080	That is an emotion that people like this prey on.
837080	840680	As white people, they want us to feel guilty about being white.
840680	842880	They want me to feel guilty about being a man.
842880	847280	They want me to feel guilty about being successful and fucking hot as hell.
847280	849680	They want... they want...
849680	853280	Gregory, I love you.
853280	856080	Well, I for one do not feel guilty about being white and male,
856080	858080	and I don't want anyone else to feel guilty about it.
858080	859880	Feeling guilty doesn't help anyone.
859880	862480	The point of being aware of your privilege and prejudices
862480	864880	is to be aware of the limitations of your own experience,
864880	868080	and the ways your thinking can be shaped by a cultural background of injustice.
868080	872280	When you aren't aware of these things, you're unable to recognize racist behavior in yourself and others,
872280	875480	which perhaps explains why a man calling himself a skeptic and a rationalist
875480	880280	seems to have fallen for the rhetoric of the worst nationalist demagogue and huckster in recent American history,
880280	884880	a man who, incidentally, claims to be the least racist person that you have ever met,
884880	888480	and who tweets pictures of a burrito to prove how much he loves Mexicans.
888480	892480	Skeptic's video, titled Defending Trump and White Privilege, is riddled with errors,
892480	895480	including his claim that American unemployment is at an old-time high.
896480	898480	That Malcolm X never advocated violence.
898480	899080	He did.
899080	899880	That, quote,
906880	909080	Skeptic redacted this last claim in a comment,
909080	911480	but the fact that he made this basic error in the first place
911480	914080	leads me to believe that he's pretty new to this conversation.
914080	915880	Then when he lost subscribers because of it,
915880	918880	he complained on Twitter to the gay British version of Ann Coulter,
918880	923080	a person who never would have been taken seriously by the online skeptic community eight years ago,
923080	925080	when Sarah Palin would have been Nero's mommy.
925080	928480	Or was the problem with Palin not what she believed and did, but with her gender?
928480	932280	What's alarming to me is the way certain people on YouTube flex whatever intellects they have
932280	937080	by attacking the most facile and ignorant arguments of religious fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists,
937080	939680	arguments which any clever middle school graduate could debunk,
939680	943480	and then they emerge from this easy triumph filled with confidence that they're fully equipped
943480	948480	to tackle extremely complicated social and political issues without first doing any serious research.
948480	950280	I know I'm kind of being a dick about this,
950280	953880	but as someone who's currently watching my country, along with the UK and Europe,
953880	957280	succumbed to the worst fit of nationalist insanity since World War II,
957280	959880	I'm starting to feel like I'm living in some sort of nightmare.
959880	961680	Or maybe it's only a bad trip.
962280	965280	Oh God, I took too much. Took too much, man.
965280	967680	Oh, this is hell. Okay.
967680	970680	I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.
970680	974080	I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.
974080	977880	It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take the pills. It's gonna be fine.
984280	985280	Yes!
986280	989480	No! Oh, I'm fucked. Oh, I'm doomed.
989480	993080	Oh, this is the end. Every second is a millennium. I am so fucked.
993080	998280	Oh God. Okay. Calm down. Stay cool. What do we got? What do we got here?
998280	1003880	What's this? What's... Wait, wait. Complete works. Okay.
1003880	1010080	It is just drugged. It's just drugged. We're gonna wait it out. We're gonna wait it out and read.
1010080	1011280	Let's see.
1020480	1026480	Raw, unannounced, no lube. Just ripped your faggoty as panties apart and came all over you?
