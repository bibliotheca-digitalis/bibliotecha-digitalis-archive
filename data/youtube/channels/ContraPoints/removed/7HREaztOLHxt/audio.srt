1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, looks like Lord Helmet has grazed my video with a response.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Who is this skeptical knight anyway?

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,840
This quizzical equestrian?

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,800
Wha-wha-wha-wha-where from does he get his ideas?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,240
What kind of hideous neckbeard mug is lurking behind that goddamn helmet anyway?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Oh.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,960
Well, that is a lot more attractive than what I was expecting.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,720
Wonder what I'll have to do to get inside that armor.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,920
Ah, so that's his game.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,740
Well, that's certainly in my playbook.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,420
Looks like Skeptic and I are about to get off.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Good boy.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,460
But first, I'd like to turn on.

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,260
Skeptic, I think you'll find this video a little more interesting if you take one of

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,260
these.

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,140
So, here's one for you.

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,780
Open your mouth.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,900
A little wider.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,900
And one for me.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:59,180
You're just gonna want to hold on your tongue for a minute and then just swallow it down.

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:09,620
And now, we wait.

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
Good God.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:55,660
Before I get started, I want to take a moment to explain what I think the point of making

24
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,100
a response video is.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,580
Whenever some knight of reason makes a video response to me, some of his followers usually

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,520
come rushing over to my channel to announce the triumph of masculine rationality over

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,260
my faggoty-ass panties.

28
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,740
For example, way to lump armored Skeptic in when he hasn't done anything on the issue

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,920
of Milo.

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,260
Now he ripped your asshole open.

31
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,800
Good job.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,020
And Justicar just annihilated this video.

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,020
He went in on you like there was no tomorrow, as if we were on the brink of extinction.

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
Raw!

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Unannounced.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,420
No lube.

37
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,800
Just ripped your faggoty-ass panties apart and shamed all over you.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,340
Is tearing your opponent's butthole to shreds really the aim of rationality?

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,140
I always thought the purpose of rational argument was communication, or even, y'know,

40
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,840
breaching some kind of mutual understanding, not just annihilating a human being.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,340
Socrates wasn't arguing with the citizens of Athens because he wanted to blast their

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
butthole.

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,640
Actually, he did want to do that.

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,900
But wasn't there also a thing about, like, truth and justice?

45
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,860
Also, why is anal rape your go-to metaphor for winning an argument anyway?

46
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,620
What does that say about your values?

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,280
It reminds me of the internet term butthurt, which describes someone who complains a lot

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,500
when their feelings are hurt.

49
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,260
Just like a victim of anal rape.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,500
And why do dudes who like putting their dicks in people spend so much time denigrating people

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,460
who like having dicks put inside them anyway?

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,060
Shouldn't they be, like, erecting monuments to these noble dick takers?

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,820
Anyway, the point of this preamble is that I don't hate armored skeptic.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,820
If we met in person, I mean, it would probably be kind of awkward, but I'm sure we'd drink

55
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,420
some beers and talk things over and it would be fine.

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,600
Hello, Greg.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,100
Your name is Greg, yes.

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,660
I am Nick.

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,540
Hello.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,420
Try the wine!

61
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,000
The problem is this medium.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,140
These goddamn savages demand a circus, and I intend to give them one.

63
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,840
But behind the curtain I really just want to have a conversation.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,420
Not trying to tear Skeptic's rectum into a billion shreds.

65
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,900
I just crave human touch.

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,860
Why won't you touch me, mommy?

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,960
Why won't you tell me you love me?

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:03,440
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

69
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,180
So, if I were to make a full response video to Armored Skeptic's two-part video on social justice,

70
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,820
it would have to be a feature-length film, probably available sometime this fall.

71
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,480
So I'm going to concentrate instead on a few important points.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,600
First, I do owe Skeptic an apology.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,740
This whole exchange was set off when I included the following clip in my video about Milo Stewart.

74
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,360
Last week, a transgender teenager named Milo Stewart uploaded a YouTube video titled,

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,240
All Cis People Are Transphobic, and You're Probably Racist Too.

76
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,500
So, what do you think happened next?

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,540
How did the YouTube anti-SJW community respond?

78
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,300
Most of the people pictured here had not made responses to Milo, and I didn't intend to suggest that they had.

79
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,880
I was using their pictures as a kind of icon for this whole anti-social justice internet movement,

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,420
or tantrum, or whatever it is.

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,920
But I realized that in context, it does look like I'm specifically calling them out.

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,480
So using this image here was inaccurate and misleading, and I do apologize to the people pictured.

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,020
Baby, I'm sorry. I'll buy you an ice cream bar.

84
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,940
I do think it's important to publicly concede when you're wrong, distasteful though it may be.

85
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,820
But now that that's out of the way, it's time to go on the offensive.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,860
Skeptic claims I've slandered him by attributing to him membership in the YouTube anti-SJW community.

87
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,920
Well, he just decided that we're all part of a community called the anti-SJW community.

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,880
I did not even know that this community existed before this video was posted.

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,680
I didn't know that anybody could be called an anti-SJW.

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Could you please explain to me what that means?

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,400
Well, how about this for a definition?

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,400
An anti-SJW is a person, usually a white man, who posts video after video complaining about

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Anita Sarkeesian, feminism, Black Lives Matter, PC culture, and so on.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,760
In fact, if you unironically use the word SJW a lot, you're probably an anti-SJW.

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,880
I'm honestly amazed that you're denying involvement in an online community of some kind.

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,080
I mean, you made this picture! You tweeted it!

97
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,680
You're friends with these people, you're dating one of them, you tweet at them, some of them support you financially,

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,480
you make videos about the same topics, the people subscribed to you tend to also be subscribed to them.

99
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,280
If this isn't an online community, then I guess there's no such thing as an online community.

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,880
You seem to want to deny any kind of involvement in a community,

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,680
because it jars with your image of yourself as an individual free-thinking skeptic who reaches his own conclusions.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
But can you at least recognize that you're part of a trend?

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,680
I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Human life is just communal by nature.

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,680
No one's really that original. Even geniuses are pretty easy to place within a movement.

105
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
Shakespeare belongs in the same group with Marlowe,

106
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
Jimi Hendrix came out of blues and psychedelic rock,

107
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
and where would the genius armored skeptic be without precursors like Thunderf00t and TJ?

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Still, I guess I should be glad that you don't have more community loyalty,

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,680
since I am trying to persuade you to change your mind.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Unless, of course, you're right and I'm wrong, in which case I hope you change my mind.

111
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,480
There! I said it!

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
If you'd like to congratulate me on how nuanced I am, you may do that now.

113
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,680
So to get to the heart of my disagreement with Skeptic,

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,080
I guess we need to go back to the celebrated gender confusion, Milo Stewart.

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,480
Our disagreement is about whether Milo's claim that all white people are racist is inherently offensive and bigoted.

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,280
I got approximately 10 million comments on my video about this,

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,280
from people who claim to be deeply offended and upset and bullied even by Milo.

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,480
Yes, this Milo, the one who sometimes wears a dress, and sometimes spins around in a chair.

119
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
Whee!

120
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,680
You know what, guys? I simply don't believe that your cis feelings are hurt.

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,480
I know, because being cisgender makes your daily life so much harder,

122
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,280
and you're a little sensitive about this because of all the oppression and bullying that you've had to face as a cisgender person.

123
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
This is just a preposterous idea, and I'm not going to entertain it.

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,880
So look, what's the most plausible interpretation of the claim that all white people are racist?

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,480
Well, it's certainly not that all white people are bigoted clansmen.

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,280
This is obviously false, and we can dismiss it without further discussion.

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
Case closed. What's next?

128
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Well, how about the idea that all white people have some degree of racial bias?

129
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,480
What about the idea that everyone has some degree of racial bias?

130
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,880
Oh, well, if this is a fact, then it should be very easy for you to prove, right?

131
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Well, not necessarily. There are some facts that are very difficult to prove.

132
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,080
But in this case, the evidence supports the view that most people are susceptible to some degree of implicit racial bias.

133
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,880
In the description of this video, I'll link to a document from the National Center for State Courts

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
that summarizes a lot of the scientific literature on this subject.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah, sure, bias sucks, but bias isn't inherently a problem.

136
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Just because somebody has a mental bias does not mean that they act on it in any way.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,280
Well, it's true that implicit mental bias is not itself a moral transgression.

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,880
It's definitely not something people should feel guilty about, and more on guilt later.

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,480
But implicit bias certainly can lead you to behave in discriminatory ways,

140
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,280
sometimes with very serious consequences, as in this case, animated by the Crash Course YouTube channel.

141
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,880
In February 1999, four New York City police officers were on patrol in the Bronx

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,680
when they saw a young black man standing on a stoop.

143
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
They thought he looked suspicious.

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,080
When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket.

145
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,280
He kept digging as the police shouted at him to show his hands.

146
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,080
A few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was dead,

147
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
hit by 19 of the 41 bullets that the police fired at him.

148
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,480
What Diallo was reaching for was his wallet.

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,680
He was going for his ID as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building.

150
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,680
There were also studies that showed that implicit racial bias affects decisions

151
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,480
made by doctors, hiring managers, judges, jurors, and voters.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,080
These are pretty important decisions, so implicit racial bias in these cases is not just a trivial thing.

153
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
One of the dangers of being unaware or in denial about your own bias

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,480
is that you might be acting on the basis of your bias without even realizing it.

155
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,280
This is especially a problem since almost no one is explicitly racist anymore.

156
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,680
For an example of what I mean by that, on June 2011, a group of white teenagers in Mississippi

157
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,080
beat an innocent black man named Craig Anderson to death while repeatedly saying ****

158
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
and shouting WHITE PAR.

159
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
It would be hard to think of a more obviously racist event than this,

160
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,280
and yet, in the aftermath of the murder, the families and friends of the perpetrators

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
all agreed that none of these confused young kids were racist at all.

162
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,680
They just got caught up in a little teenage stupidity.

163
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
According to one of the perpetrator's boyfriends,

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,680
the news coverage is about trying to bring racism back.

165
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,080
This kind of stuff is what brings racism into the world.

166
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,680
I don't see the point in saying anything about race or involving race.

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,280
It just makes blacks hate whites and white hate blacks all the more.

168
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,880
The idea is that you can go and commit hate crimes

169
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,080
and then when people accuse you of being racist,

170
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,680
you say that actually, they're the real racists.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,280
There you were innocently murdering black people,

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,280
and then a bunch of racists came along and brought race into it

173
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,680
by calling you racist like a bunch of racists.

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,480
This is an extreme version of the common claim that Black Lives Matter is racist

175
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,880
because they bring race up and create hostility.

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm not even gonna get into how the Black Lives Matter movement is a regressive movement

177
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,480
designed to create an us-and-them mentality between the black and white communities

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,880
as well as keep black people in a perpetual victim class.

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,680
How are the people standing up for themselves and trying to change their situation

180
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,680
the ones who are keeping black people in a perpetual victim class?

181
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,080
Isn't that, like, exactly the opposite of what is true?

182
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,880
I guess the problem is that Skeptic doesn't believe there is systemic racial injustice in America,

183
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,680
so he thinks the protesters are crybabies whining about imaginary oppression.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,280
It would require a separate video, or, you know, 500, to argue that there is, in fact, racism in America,

185
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,680
and maybe I'll make that video at some point if I see enough comments from people who don't see race because racism is over.

186
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
But that is such a stupid position!

187
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,880
Are you sure that's your position, Skeptic? Are you sure you don't want to change your mind?

188
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,680
I offer now is the time to change your mind.

189
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,880
Maybe do ten minutes of research on police brutality and mass incarceration before answering.

190
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,880
When you confront these people and ask them for proof that they're actually being oppressed or a part of an oppressed group,

191
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,280
they just tell you, hey, Whitey, you don't see it because you're part of the system.

192
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
But are you sure it's not true that you don't see it because you're part of the system?

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,080
It appears that you have the privilege of never really having had to think about race until now,

194
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,280
whereas a lot of people are constantly reminded of their race by the obstacles it puts in front of them,

195
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,480
and then you have the audacity to call them racist for bringing it up.

196
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Now, race and racial tension is not something that I generally talk about,

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,080
mainly because it's not something I have a lot of experience with.

198
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Well, that's pretty obvious from these videos.

199
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,080
You say the deepest rabbit hole of bigotry you've ever experienced was watching videos from Milo Stewart,

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,280
an indication that you have no idea whatsoever what it's like to face actual racism.

201
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Now, to be fair, Skeptic is also probably referring to Ghazi, who actually is a racist crackpot.

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Milo, you fucked up by citing this guy.

203
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,480
He is not a reliable source of information about, well, anything.

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I mean, he's funny.

205
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Jew, I am your father.

206
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Jew, I am your father.

207
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,480
It's good, but he should not say the things that he says.

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Maybe next time try Kat Black?

209
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Incidentally, can Black people be racist?

210
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes, of course they can.

211
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
But Black supremacy does not and ever has been a systemic threat to white people in America,

212
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
whereas the reverse is obviously the case.

213
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
So white racism is a lot more harmful.

214
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,680
Speaking of Milo, I think the best point in his video was this one.

215
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,680
The whole point of acknowledging that we're racist, transphobic, misogynistic, etc.,

216
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,880
is so that we can better recognize our biases and work to overcome them.

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
This is exactly what the NCSC pamphlet suggests.

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,280
Consciously acknowledging group differences instead of feigning colorblindness,

219
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,880
scrutinizing your own thoughts and feelings,

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,280
and exposing yourself to stereotyped group members in a positive context

221
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,480
are all ways to mitigate the effects of implicit bias on your judgment.

222
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Although I can't definitively prove that everyone has racial biases,

223
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,080
I become skeptical when anyone claims to be immune to them.

224
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,680
It would be like someone telling me that they never recognize patterns where there aren't any,

225
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,880
or that they're never influenced by social pressure.

226
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,480
It kind of raises a red flag and makes me think that this person isn't very aware of their own limitations.

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,880
All of this applies to behavior as well as attitudes.

228
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,680
I agree with the Avenue Q thesis that everyone's a little bit racist sometimes.

229
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,280
Pretty much everyone has told a racist joke or made a racist assumption at some point,

230
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
and this does not make you a monster,

231
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,480
but these things can add up to have damaging effects, and they do reinforce biases.

232
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,280
You don't need to feel really guilty about it,

233
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,880
you just need to be aware of it and the potential it has to do harm.

234
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,680
But Skeptic seems really fixated on this idea that social justice warriors supposedly want him to feel guilty.

235
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,280
He brings it up again and again.

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,280
And just like feminism's greatest weapon is to make men feel guilty for being men,

237
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,280
these racially motivated groups will try to make people feel guilty for being white.

238
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,080
Trying to make people feel guilty by association for something that you can't even prove exists.

239
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,880
The most powerful emotion is guilt, and white guilt is very much a real thing.

240
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,080
That is an emotion that people like this prey on.

241
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,680
As white people, they want us to feel guilty about being white.

242
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
They want me to feel guilty about being a man.

243
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,280
They want me to feel guilty about being successful and fucking hot as hell.

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,680
They want... they want...

245
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,280
Gregory, I love you.

246
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Well, I for one do not feel guilty about being white and male,

247
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
and I don't want anyone else to feel guilty about it.

248
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Feeling guilty doesn't help anyone.

249
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,480
The point of being aware of your privilege and prejudices

250
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
is to be aware of the limitations of your own experience,

251
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,080
and the ways your thinking can be shaped by a cultural background of injustice.

252
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,280
When you aren't aware of these things, you're unable to recognize racist behavior in yourself and others,

253
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,480
which perhaps explains why a man calling himself a skeptic and a rationalist

254
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,280
seems to have fallen for the rhetoric of the worst nationalist demagogue and huckster in recent American history,

255
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,880
a man who, incidentally, claims to be the least racist person that you have ever met,

256
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
and who tweets pictures of a burrito to prove how much he loves Mexicans.

257
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Skeptic's video, titled Defending Trump and White Privilege, is riddled with errors,

258
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
including his claim that American unemployment is at an old-time high.

259
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
That Malcolm X never advocated violence.

260
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,080
He did.

261
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,880
That, quote,

262
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,080
Skeptic redacted this last claim in a comment,

263
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,480
but the fact that he made this basic error in the first place

264
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,080
leads me to believe that he's pretty new to this conversation.

265
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Then when he lost subscribers because of it,

266
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,880
he complained on Twitter to the gay British version of Ann Coulter,

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,080
a person who never would have been taken seriously by the online skeptic community eight years ago,

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
when Sarah Palin would have been Nero's mommy.

269
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,480
Or was the problem with Palin not what she believed and did, but with her gender?

270
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,280
What's alarming to me is the way certain people on YouTube flex whatever intellects they have

271
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,080
by attacking the most facile and ignorant arguments of religious fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists,

272
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,680
arguments which any clever middle school graduate could debunk,

273
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,480
and then they emerge from this easy triumph filled with confidence that they're fully equipped

274
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,480
to tackle extremely complicated social and political issues without first doing any serious research.

275
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,280
I know I'm kind of being a dick about this,

276
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,880
but as someone who's currently watching my country, along with the UK and Europe,

277
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,280
succumbed to the worst fit of nationalist insanity since World War II,

278
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm starting to feel like I'm living in some sort of nightmare.

279
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,680
Or maybe it's only a bad trip.

280
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh God, I took too much. Took too much, man.

281
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,680
Oh, this is hell. Okay.

282
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.

283
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,080
I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.

284
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,880
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take the pills. It's gonna be fine.

285
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Yes!

286
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,480
No! Oh, I'm fucked. Oh, I'm doomed.

287
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,080
Oh, this is the end. Every second is a millennium. I am so fucked.

288
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,280
Oh God. Okay. Calm down. Stay cool. What do we got? What do we got here?

289
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,880
What's this? What's... Wait, wait. Complete works. Okay.

290
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,080
It is just drugged. It's just drugged. We're gonna wait it out. We're gonna wait it out and read.

291
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,280
Let's see.

292
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,480
Raw, unannounced, no lube. Just ripped your faggoty as panties apart and came all over you?

293
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,480
What? No. Nooooooo.

294
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480

And now, introducing...

296
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Hi! Are you tired of watching my videos for free? Do you have too much money?

297
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,480
This video looks like shit. That's because I have no goddamn money.

298
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,480
And when I have no goddamn money, the video looks like shit.

299
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Do you not hate feminism?

300
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I have a mental illness. Green screen shadows, no color correction. These are problems of the past.

301
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Now you can give me money. I'm a big old rabbit.

302
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I just need more money. I need more money. I just need money.

303
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Patrons get access to bonus content.

304
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Give $5 or more per video and you'll get your name in the credits.

305
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
I love you.
