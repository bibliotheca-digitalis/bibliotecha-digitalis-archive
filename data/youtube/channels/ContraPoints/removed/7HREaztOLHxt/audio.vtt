WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Oh, looks like Lord Helmet has grazed my video with a response.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.140
Who is this skeptical knight anyway?

00:07.140 --> 00:08.840
This quizzical equestrian?

00:08.840 --> 00:12.800
Wha-wha-wha-wha-where from does he get his ideas?

00:12.800 --> 00:17.240
What kind of hideous neckbeard mug is lurking behind that goddamn helmet anyway?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.240
Oh.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.960
Well, that is a lot more attractive than what I was expecting.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.720
Wonder what I'll have to do to get inside that armor.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.920
Ah, so that's his game.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.740
Well, that's certainly in my playbook.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.420
Looks like Skeptic and I are about to get off.

00:30.420 --> 00:31.420
Good boy.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.460
But first, I'd like to turn on.

00:33.460 --> 00:38.260
Skeptic, I think you'll find this video a little more interesting if you take one of

00:38.260 --> 00:39.260
these.

00:39.260 --> 00:42.140
So, here's one for you.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.780
Open your mouth.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.900
A little wider.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.900
And one for me.

00:49.900 --> 00:59.180
You're just gonna want to hold on your tongue for a minute and then just swallow it down.

00:59.180 --> 01:09.620
And now, we wait.

01:09.620 --> 01:10.620
Good God.

01:40.620 --> 01:55.660
Before I get started, I want to take a moment to explain what I think the point of making

01:55.660 --> 01:57.100
a response video is.

01:57.100 --> 02:00.580
Whenever some knight of reason makes a video response to me, some of his followers usually

02:00.580 --> 02:04.520
come rushing over to my channel to announce the triumph of masculine rationality over

02:04.520 --> 02:06.260
my faggoty-ass panties.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.740
For example, way to lump armored Skeptic in when he hasn't done anything on the issue

02:09.740 --> 02:10.920
of Milo.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.260
Now he ripped your asshole open.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.800
Good job.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.020
And Justicar just annihilated this video.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.020
He went in on you like there was no tomorrow, as if we were on the brink of extinction.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.020
Raw!

02:25.020 --> 02:26.020
Unannounced.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.420
No lube.

02:27.420 --> 02:33.800
Just ripped your faggoty-ass panties apart and shamed all over you.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.340
Is tearing your opponent's butthole to shreds really the aim of rationality?

02:37.340 --> 02:41.140
I always thought the purpose of rational argument was communication, or even, y'know,

02:41.140 --> 02:44.840
breaching some kind of mutual understanding, not just annihilating a human being.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.340
Socrates wasn't arguing with the citizens of Athens because he wanted to blast their

02:48.340 --> 02:49.340
butthole.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.640
Actually, he did want to do that.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.900
But wasn't there also a thing about, like, truth and justice?

02:53.900 --> 02:57.860
Also, why is anal rape your go-to metaphor for winning an argument anyway?

02:57.860 --> 02:59.620
What does that say about your values?

02:59.620 --> 03:03.280
It reminds me of the internet term butthurt, which describes someone who complains a lot

03:03.280 --> 03:04.500
when their feelings are hurt.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.260
Just like a victim of anal rape.

03:06.260 --> 03:09.500
And why do dudes who like putting their dicks in people spend so much time denigrating people

03:09.500 --> 03:11.460
who like having dicks put inside them anyway?

03:11.460 --> 03:15.060
Shouldn't they be, like, erecting monuments to these noble dick takers?

03:15.060 --> 03:18.820
Anyway, the point of this preamble is that I don't hate armored skeptic.

03:18.820 --> 03:22.820
If we met in person, I mean, it would probably be kind of awkward, but I'm sure we'd drink

03:22.820 --> 03:25.420
some beers and talk things over and it would be fine.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.600
Hello, Greg.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.100
Your name is Greg, yes.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.660
I am Nick.

03:31.660 --> 03:34.540
Hello.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.420
Try the wine!

03:36.420 --> 03:38.000
The problem is this medium.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.140
These goddamn savages demand a circus, and I intend to give them one.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.840
But behind the curtain I really just want to have a conversation.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.420
Not trying to tear Skeptic's rectum into a billion shreds.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.900
I just crave human touch.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.860
Why won't you touch me, mommy?

03:52.860 --> 03:54.960
Why won't you tell me you love me?

03:55.740 --> 04:03.440
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

04:04.020 --> 04:08.180
So, if I were to make a full response video to Armored Skeptic's two-part video on social justice,

04:08.180 --> 04:11.820
it would have to be a feature-length film, probably available sometime this fall.

04:11.820 --> 04:14.480
So I'm going to concentrate instead on a few important points.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.600
First, I do owe Skeptic an apology.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.740
This whole exchange was set off when I included the following clip in my video about Milo Stewart.

04:20.900 --> 04:25.360
Last week, a transgender teenager named Milo Stewart uploaded a YouTube video titled,

04:25.360 --> 04:29.240
All Cis People Are Transphobic, and You're Probably Racist Too.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.500
So, what do you think happened next?

04:31.500 --> 04:34.540
How did the YouTube anti-SJW community respond?

04:34.540 --> 04:39.300
Most of the people pictured here had not made responses to Milo, and I didn't intend to suggest that they had.

04:39.300 --> 04:43.880
I was using their pictures as a kind of icon for this whole anti-social justice internet movement,

04:43.880 --> 04:45.420
or tantrum, or whatever it is.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.920
But I realized that in context, it does look like I'm specifically calling them out.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.480
So using this image here was inaccurate and misleading, and I do apologize to the people pictured.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.020
Baby, I'm sorry. I'll buy you an ice cream bar.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.940
I do think it's important to publicly concede when you're wrong, distasteful though it may be.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.820
But now that that's out of the way, it's time to go on the offensive.

05:03.820 --> 05:08.860
Skeptic claims I've slandered him by attributing to him membership in the YouTube anti-SJW community.

05:08.860 --> 05:13.920
Well, he just decided that we're all part of a community called the anti-SJW community.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.880
I did not even know that this community existed before this video was posted.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.680
I didn't know that anybody could be called an anti-SJW.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.680
Could you please explain to me what that means?

05:23.680 --> 05:25.400
Well, how about this for a definition?

05:25.400 --> 05:30.400
An anti-SJW is a person, usually a white man, who posts video after video complaining about

05:30.400 --> 05:34.800
Anita Sarkeesian, feminism, Black Lives Matter, PC culture, and so on.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.760
In fact, if you unironically use the word SJW a lot, you're probably an anti-SJW.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.880
I'm honestly amazed that you're denying involvement in an online community of some kind.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.080
I mean, you made this picture! You tweeted it!

05:47.080 --> 05:52.680
You're friends with these people, you're dating one of them, you tweet at them, some of them support you financially,

05:52.680 --> 05:57.480
you make videos about the same topics, the people subscribed to you tend to also be subscribed to them.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.280
If this isn't an online community, then I guess there's no such thing as an online community.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.880
You seem to want to deny any kind of involvement in a community,

06:03.880 --> 06:08.680
because it jars with your image of yourself as an individual free-thinking skeptic who reaches his own conclusions.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.880
But can you at least recognize that you're part of a trend?

06:10.880 --> 06:14.680
I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Human life is just communal by nature.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.680
No one's really that original. Even geniuses are pretty easy to place within a movement.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.880
Shakespeare belongs in the same group with Marlowe,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.280
Jimi Hendrix came out of blues and psychedelic rock,

06:23.280 --> 06:27.680
and where would the genius armored skeptic be without precursors like Thunderf00t and TJ?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.480
Still, I guess I should be glad that you don't have more community loyalty,

06:30.480 --> 06:32.680
since I am trying to persuade you to change your mind.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.080
Unless, of course, you're right and I'm wrong, in which case I hope you change my mind.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
There! I said it!

06:37.480 --> 06:40.480
If you'd like to congratulate me on how nuanced I am, you may do that now.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.680
So to get to the heart of my disagreement with Skeptic,

06:42.680 --> 06:46.080
I guess we need to go back to the celebrated gender confusion, Milo Stewart.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.480
Our disagreement is about whether Milo's claim that all white people are racist is inherently offensive and bigoted.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.280
I got approximately 10 million comments on my video about this,

06:54.280 --> 06:58.280
from people who claim to be deeply offended and upset and bullied even by Milo.

06:58.280 --> 07:03.480
Yes, this Milo, the one who sometimes wears a dress, and sometimes spins around in a chair.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.680
Whee!

07:04.680 --> 07:07.680
You know what, guys? I simply don't believe that your cis feelings are hurt.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.480
I know, because being cisgender makes your daily life so much harder,

07:10.480 --> 07:15.280
and you're a little sensitive about this because of all the oppression and bullying that you've had to face as a cisgender person.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.080
This is just a preposterous idea, and I'm not going to entertain it.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.880
So look, what's the most plausible interpretation of the claim that all white people are racist?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.480
Well, it's certainly not that all white people are bigoted clansmen.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.280
This is obviously false, and we can dismiss it without further discussion.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.880
Case closed. What's next?

07:28.880 --> 07:32.080
Well, how about the idea that all white people have some degree of racial bias?

07:32.080 --> 07:35.480
What about the idea that everyone has some degree of racial bias?

07:35.480 --> 07:39.880
Oh, well, if this is a fact, then it should be very easy for you to prove, right?

07:39.880 --> 07:43.080
Well, not necessarily. There are some facts that are very difficult to prove.

07:43.080 --> 07:48.080
But in this case, the evidence supports the view that most people are susceptible to some degree of implicit racial bias.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.880
In the description of this video, I'll link to a document from the National Center for State Courts

07:51.880 --> 07:54.880
that summarizes a lot of the scientific literature on this subject.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.880
Yeah, sure, bias sucks, but bias isn't inherently a problem.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.880
Just because somebody has a mental bias does not mean that they act on it in any way.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.280
Well, it's true that implicit mental bias is not itself a moral transgression.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.880
It's definitely not something people should feel guilty about, and more on guilt later.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.480
But implicit bias certainly can lead you to behave in discriminatory ways,

08:13.480 --> 08:18.280
sometimes with very serious consequences, as in this case, animated by the Crash Course YouTube channel.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.880
In February 1999, four New York City police officers were on patrol in the Bronx

08:22.880 --> 08:25.680
when they saw a young black man standing on a stoop.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.680
They thought he looked suspicious.

08:27.680 --> 08:32.080
When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.280
He kept digging as the police shouted at him to show his hands.

08:35.280 --> 08:40.080
A few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was dead,

08:40.080 --> 08:43.680
hit by 19 of the 41 bullets that the police fired at him.

08:43.680 --> 08:46.480
What Diallo was reaching for was his wallet.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.680
He was going for his ID as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.680
There were also studies that showed that implicit racial bias affects decisions

08:53.680 --> 08:57.480
made by doctors, hiring managers, judges, jurors, and voters.

08:57.480 --> 09:02.080
These are pretty important decisions, so implicit racial bias in these cases is not just a trivial thing.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.080
One of the dangers of being unaware or in denial about your own bias

09:05.080 --> 09:08.480
is that you might be acting on the basis of your bias without even realizing it.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.280
This is especially a problem since almost no one is explicitly racist anymore.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.680
For an example of what I mean by that, on June 2011, a group of white teenagers in Mississippi

09:16.680 --> 09:21.080
beat an innocent black man named Craig Anderson to death while repeatedly saying ****

09:21.080 --> 09:22.880
and shouting WHITE PAR.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.880
It would be hard to think of a more obviously racist event than this,

09:25.880 --> 09:29.280
and yet, in the aftermath of the murder, the families and friends of the perpetrators

09:29.280 --> 09:32.280
all agreed that none of these confused young kids were racist at all.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.680
They just got caught up in a little teenage stupidity.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.880
According to one of the perpetrator's boyfriends,

09:36.880 --> 09:40.680
the news coverage is about trying to bring racism back.

09:40.680 --> 09:44.080
This kind of stuff is what brings racism into the world.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.680
I don't see the point in saying anything about race or involving race.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.280
It just makes blacks hate whites and white hate blacks all the more.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.880
The idea is that you can go and commit hate crimes

09:54.880 --> 09:57.080
and then when people accuse you of being racist,

09:57.080 --> 10:00.680
you say that actually, they're the real racists.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.280
There you were innocently murdering black people,

10:03.280 --> 10:07.280
and then a bunch of racists came along and brought race into it

10:07.280 --> 10:10.680
by calling you racist like a bunch of racists.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.480
This is an extreme version of the common claim that Black Lives Matter is racist

10:14.480 --> 10:17.880
because they bring race up and create hostility.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.280
I'm not even gonna get into how the Black Lives Matter movement is a regressive movement

10:21.280 --> 10:25.480
designed to create an us-and-them mentality between the black and white communities

10:25.480 --> 10:28.880
as well as keep black people in a perpetual victim class.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.680
How are the people standing up for themselves and trying to change their situation

10:32.680 --> 10:35.680
the ones who are keeping black people in a perpetual victim class?

10:35.680 --> 10:39.080
Isn't that, like, exactly the opposite of what is true?

10:39.080 --> 10:43.880
I guess the problem is that Skeptic doesn't believe there is systemic racial injustice in America,

10:43.880 --> 10:47.680
so he thinks the protesters are crybabies whining about imaginary oppression.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.280
It would require a separate video, or, you know, 500, to argue that there is, in fact, racism in America,

10:53.280 --> 10:58.680
and maybe I'll make that video at some point if I see enough comments from people who don't see race because racism is over.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.680
But that is such a stupid position!

11:00.680 --> 11:03.880
Are you sure that's your position, Skeptic? Are you sure you don't want to change your mind?

11:03.880 --> 11:05.680
I offer now is the time to change your mind.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.880
Maybe do ten minutes of research on police brutality and mass incarceration before answering.

11:09.880 --> 11:14.880
When you confront these people and ask them for proof that they're actually being oppressed or a part of an oppressed group,

11:14.880 --> 11:19.280
they just tell you, hey, Whitey, you don't see it because you're part of the system.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.280
But are you sure it's not true that you don't see it because you're part of the system?

11:22.280 --> 11:26.080
It appears that you have the privilege of never really having had to think about race until now,

11:26.080 --> 11:30.280
whereas a lot of people are constantly reminded of their race by the obstacles it puts in front of them,

11:30.280 --> 11:33.480
and then you have the audacity to call them racist for bringing it up.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.480
Now, race and racial tension is not something that I generally talk about,

11:37.480 --> 11:41.080
mainly because it's not something I have a lot of experience with.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
Well, that's pretty obvious from these videos.

11:43.080 --> 11:48.080
You say the deepest rabbit hole of bigotry you've ever experienced was watching videos from Milo Stewart,

11:48.080 --> 11:52.280
an indication that you have no idea whatsoever what it's like to face actual racism.

11:52.280 --> 11:57.280
Now, to be fair, Skeptic is also probably referring to Ghazi, who actually is a racist crackpot.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.280
Milo, you fucked up by citing this guy.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.480
He is not a reliable source of information about, well, anything.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.480
I mean, he's funny.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.280
Jew, I am your father.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.280
Jew, I am your father.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.480
It's good, but he should not say the things that he says.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.480
Maybe next time try Kat Black?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.280
Incidentally, can Black people be racist?

12:13.280 --> 12:14.280
Yes, of course they can.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.280
But Black supremacy does not and ever has been a systemic threat to white people in America,

12:18.280 --> 12:20.280
whereas the reverse is obviously the case.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.280
So white racism is a lot more harmful.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.680
Speaking of Milo, I think the best point in his video was this one.

12:25.680 --> 12:31.680
The whole point of acknowledging that we're racist, transphobic, misogynistic, etc.,

12:31.680 --> 12:36.880
is so that we can better recognize our biases and work to overcome them.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.880
This is exactly what the NCSC pamphlet suggests.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.280
Consciously acknowledging group differences instead of feigning colorblindness,

12:43.280 --> 12:44.880
scrutinizing your own thoughts and feelings,

12:44.880 --> 12:48.280
and exposing yourself to stereotyped group members in a positive context

12:48.280 --> 12:51.480
are all ways to mitigate the effects of implicit bias on your judgment.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.480
Although I can't definitively prove that everyone has racial biases,

12:54.480 --> 12:57.080
I become skeptical when anyone claims to be immune to them.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.680
It would be like someone telling me that they never recognize patterns where there aren't any,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.880
or that they're never influenced by social pressure.

13:02.880 --> 13:07.480
It kind of raises a red flag and makes me think that this person isn't very aware of their own limitations.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.880
All of this applies to behavior as well as attitudes.

13:09.880 --> 13:13.680
I agree with the Avenue Q thesis that everyone's a little bit racist sometimes.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.280
Pretty much everyone has told a racist joke or made a racist assumption at some point,

13:17.280 --> 13:18.680
and this does not make you a monster,

13:18.680 --> 13:22.480
but these things can add up to have damaging effects, and they do reinforce biases.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.280
You don't need to feel really guilty about it,

13:24.280 --> 13:26.880
you just need to be aware of it and the potential it has to do harm.

13:26.880 --> 13:32.680
But Skeptic seems really fixated on this idea that social justice warriors supposedly want him to feel guilty.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.280
He brings it up again and again.

13:34.280 --> 13:38.280
And just like feminism's greatest weapon is to make men feel guilty for being men,

13:38.280 --> 13:42.280
these racially motivated groups will try to make people feel guilty for being white.

13:42.280 --> 13:47.080
Trying to make people feel guilty by association for something that you can't even prove exists.

13:47.080 --> 13:52.880
The most powerful emotion is guilt, and white guilt is very much a real thing.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.080
That is an emotion that people like this prey on.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.680
As white people, they want us to feel guilty about being white.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.880
They want me to feel guilty about being a man.

14:02.880 --> 14:07.280
They want me to feel guilty about being successful and fucking hot as hell.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.680
They want... they want...

14:09.680 --> 14:13.280
Gregory, I love you.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.080
Well, I for one do not feel guilty about being white and male,

14:16.080 --> 14:18.080
and I don't want anyone else to feel guilty about it.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.880
Feeling guilty doesn't help anyone.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.480
The point of being aware of your privilege and prejudices

14:22.480 --> 14:24.880
is to be aware of the limitations of your own experience,

14:24.880 --> 14:28.080
and the ways your thinking can be shaped by a cultural background of injustice.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.280
When you aren't aware of these things, you're unable to recognize racist behavior in yourself and others,

14:32.280 --> 14:35.480
which perhaps explains why a man calling himself a skeptic and a rationalist

14:35.480 --> 14:40.280
seems to have fallen for the rhetoric of the worst nationalist demagogue and huckster in recent American history,

14:40.280 --> 14:44.880
a man who, incidentally, claims to be the least racist person that you have ever met,

14:44.880 --> 14:48.480
and who tweets pictures of a burrito to prove how much he loves Mexicans.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.480
Skeptic's video, titled Defending Trump and White Privilege, is riddled with errors,

14:52.480 --> 14:55.480
including his claim that American unemployment is at an old-time high.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.480
That Malcolm X never advocated violence.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.080
He did.

14:59.080 --> 14:59.880
That, quote,

15:06.880 --> 15:09.080
Skeptic redacted this last claim in a comment,

15:09.080 --> 15:11.480
but the fact that he made this basic error in the first place

15:11.480 --> 15:14.080
leads me to believe that he's pretty new to this conversation.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.880
Then when he lost subscribers because of it,

15:15.880 --> 15:18.880
he complained on Twitter to the gay British version of Ann Coulter,

15:18.880 --> 15:23.080
a person who never would have been taken seriously by the online skeptic community eight years ago,

15:23.080 --> 15:25.080
when Sarah Palin would have been Nero's mommy.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.480
Or was the problem with Palin not what she believed and did, but with her gender?

15:28.480 --> 15:32.280
What's alarming to me is the way certain people on YouTube flex whatever intellects they have

15:32.280 --> 15:37.080
by attacking the most facile and ignorant arguments of religious fundamentalists and conspiracy theorists,

15:37.080 --> 15:39.680
arguments which any clever middle school graduate could debunk,

15:39.680 --> 15:43.480
and then they emerge from this easy triumph filled with confidence that they're fully equipped

15:43.480 --> 15:48.480
to tackle extremely complicated social and political issues without first doing any serious research.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.280
I know I'm kind of being a dick about this,

15:50.280 --> 15:53.880
but as someone who's currently watching my country, along with the UK and Europe,

15:53.880 --> 15:57.280
succumbed to the worst fit of nationalist insanity since World War II,

15:57.280 --> 15:59.880
I'm starting to feel like I'm living in some sort of nightmare.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.680
Or maybe it's only a bad trip.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.280
Oh God, I took too much. Took too much, man.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.680
Oh, this is hell. Okay.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.680
I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.080
I think I've got some Klonopin left. I think I've got some Klonopin left.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.880
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take the pills. It's gonna be fine.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.280
Yes!

16:26.280 --> 16:29.480
No! Oh, I'm fucked. Oh, I'm doomed.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.080
Oh, this is the end. Every second is a millennium. I am so fucked.

16:33.080 --> 16:38.280
Oh God. Okay. Calm down. Stay cool. What do we got? What do we got here?

16:38.280 --> 16:43.880
What's this? What's... Wait, wait. Complete works. Okay.

16:43.880 --> 16:50.080
It is just drugged. It's just drugged. We're gonna wait it out. We're gonna wait it out and read.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.280
Let's see.

17:00.480 --> 17:06.480
Raw, unannounced, no lube. Just ripped your faggoty as panties apart and came all over you?

17:06.480 --> 17:11.480
What? No. Nooooooo.

Hi! Are you tired of watching my videos for free? Do you have too much money?

17:30.480 --> 17:35.480
This video looks like shit. That's because I have no goddamn money.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.480
And when I have no goddamn money, the video looks like shit.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.480
Do you not hate feminism?

17:46.480 --> 17:53.480
I have a mental illness. Green screen shadows, no color correction. These are problems of the past.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.480
Now you can give me money. I'm a big old rabbit.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.480
I just need more money. I need more money. I just need money.
