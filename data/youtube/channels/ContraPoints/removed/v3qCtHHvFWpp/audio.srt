1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Uh, Ion Hisilius has come out against this and says, no, that's not right.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,080
In fact, liberal Western values are in fact correct when they say that it is wrong to

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,280
cut, to mutilate little girls' genitals without anesthesia.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
That is wrong.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
We can put our foot down.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
It doesn't matter what culture you come from.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,080
It doesn't matter what I personally believe about it.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,200
Meet Dillentine Two, a 9-11 truther.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,080
Dillentine Two is going to try and answer some questions.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Hi, Dillentine.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Excuse me.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,080
Allow me to readjust my antennae.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Oh no, my aluminum foil.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,080
I have to protect my brain against the pulsars.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,760
At this point in the interview, the satellite connection unexpectedly failed.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,040
Dillentine Two was later to rely on this as evidence of a conspiracy, although he was

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
uncertain as to what conspiracy.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,840
In any event, we pick it up a few minutes later.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,240
Oh my God.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Dillentine Two, how long did it take for the Twin Towers to collapse?

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,760
9-11 was an inside job.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, but how long did it take for them to collapse?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nine seconds.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,240
OK, but have you seen the footage that clearly shows that they don't fall in that time?

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
They fell at free-fall speed.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
But nine seconds is free-fall speed.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Nearly free-fall speed.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Nearly.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Well, what is nearly free-fall speed?

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
9-11 was an inside job.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,240
9-11 was an inside job.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Oh God, let's move on.

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
OK, so what is your best piece of evidence to support your theory?

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
9-11 was an inside job.

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Yes, I think we've got that message.

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
But what is your...

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
World Trade Center Seven.

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
What about it?

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
No steel structure has ever collapsed through fire.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Well, that's simply not true, is it?

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Operation Northwood, Bay of Pigs, Pearl Harbor.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
What? Can you explain?

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,240
9-11 was an inside job.

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Oh God.

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
So what about the Pentagon?

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
The hole's too small.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I said the hole's too small.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,240
The hole is too small.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
What on earth are you talking about?

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
How big was the hole?

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,240
17 feet, diametrically speaking.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
And are you sure about that?

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Look, I don't want your mercury-laden, cancer-laden photograph.

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Yeah, enough, enough.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Thanks for your help, Delantine, to...

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
9-11!

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Shut up.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
We can't just let him upload it.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Because, I mean, you know, it's like there's no hotline or anything that can do anything about this.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
I mean, the police wouldn't come.

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
They wouldn't understand the implications and the dangers of posting a video like that.

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
They wouldn't understand that it's dangerous.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
We don't want to alarm him. I mean, he's on Skype.

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
He can hear everything we're saying.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Nick, you doing alright? Yeah?

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
You doing alright, hey?

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Niz? Can you hear us?

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah.

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Why are you talking to me?

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm just a hot dog.

71
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
No.

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
No one even likes hot dogs.
