00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Uh, Ion Hisilius has come out against this and says, no, that's not right.

00:06.000 --> 00:14.080
In fact, liberal Western values are in fact correct when they say that it is wrong to

00:14.080 --> 00:19.280
cut, to mutilate little girls' genitals without anesthesia.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.280
That is wrong.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.280
We can put our foot down.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.480
It doesn't matter what culture you come from.

00:22.480 --> 00:28.080
It doesn't matter what I personally believe about it.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.200
Meet Dillentine Two, a 9-11 truther.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.080
Dillentine Two is going to try and answer some questions.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.080
Hi, Dillentine.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Excuse me.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.080
Allow me to readjust my antennae.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.080
Oh no, my aluminum foil.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.080
I have to protect my brain against the pulsars.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.760
At this point in the interview, the satellite connection unexpectedly failed.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.040
Dillentine Two was later to rely on this as evidence of a conspiracy, although he was

00:58.040 --> 01:00.040
uncertain as to what conspiracy.

01:00.040 --> 01:03.840
In any event, we pick it up a few minutes later.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.240
Oh my God.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.240
Dillentine Two, how long did it take for the Twin Towers to collapse?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.760
9-11 was an inside job.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.000
Yes, but how long did it take for them to collapse?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Nine seconds.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.240
OK, but have you seen the footage that clearly shows that they don't fall in that time?

01:26.240 --> 01:28.240
They fell at free-fall speed.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.240
But nine seconds is free-fall speed.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.240
Nearly free-fall speed.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
Nearly.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.240
Well, what is nearly free-fall speed?

01:39.240 --> 01:43.240
9-11 was an inside job.

01:43.240 --> 01:48.240
9-11 was an inside job.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.240
Oh God, let's move on.

01:51.240 --> 01:56.240
OK, so what is your best piece of evidence to support your theory?

01:56.240 --> 02:00.240
9-11 was an inside job.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.240
Yes, I think we've got that message.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.240
But what is your...

02:03.240 --> 02:06.240
World Trade Center Seven.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.240
What about it?

02:07.240 --> 02:12.240
No steel structure has ever collapsed through fire.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.240
Well, that's simply not true, is it?

02:14.240 --> 02:20.240
Operation Northwood, Bay of Pigs, Pearl Harbor.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.240
What? Can you explain?

02:22.240 --> 02:27.240
9-11 was an inside job.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.240
Oh God.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.240
So what about the Pentagon?

02:31.240 --> 02:33.240
The hole's too small.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.240
I said the hole's too small.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.240
The hole is too small.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.240
What on earth are you talking about?

02:42.240 --> 02:44.240
How big was the hole?

02:44.240 --> 02:47.240
17 feet, diametrically speaking.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.240
And are you sure about that?

02:49.240 --> 02:55.240
Look, I don't want your mercury-laden, cancer-laden photograph.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
Yeah, enough, enough.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.240
Thanks for your help, Delantine, to...

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
9-11!

03:00.240 --> 03:02.240
Shut up.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.240
We can't just let him upload it.

03:04.240 --> 03:08.240
Because, I mean, you know, it's like there's no hotline or anything that can do anything about this.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.240
I mean, the police wouldn't come.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.240
They wouldn't understand the implications and the dangers of posting a video like that.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.240
They wouldn't understand that it's dangerous.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.240
We don't want to alarm him. I mean, he's on Skype.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.240
He can hear everything we're saying.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.240
Nick, you doing alright? Yeah?

03:22.240 --> 03:23.240
You doing alright, hey?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.240
Niz? Can you hear us?

03:25.240 --> 03:26.240
Yeah.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
Why are you talking to me?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.240
I'm just a hot dog.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.240
No.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.240
No one even likes hot dogs.
