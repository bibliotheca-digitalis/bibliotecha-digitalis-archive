1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni tells the story of the Spanish legend Don Juan,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,840
a man who sleeps with as many women as possible because he thinks he can repent before he dies.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
In Mozart's version, the Don seems at first like just a generic sexual predator prick.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,080
When a woman accuses him of rape, he ices her old man and retreats to his palazzo.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
But we soon learn something weirder is going on.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
When one of his jilted lovers shows up, Don Giovanni's servant Leporello explains to her

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,440
that the Don keeps a catalog of all the women he's conquered.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,560
640 in Italy, 231 in Germany, 100 in France, 91 in Turkey, and in Spain, 1003.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,000
This catalog aria is what a boring white weirdo named Kierkegaard

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
called the most epic moment of the opera.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,880
It's the moment that we learn that Don Giovanni is not just a predator,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,800
but that he's actually fucking insane.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
He doesn't care whether the women are young or old, beautiful or ugly, rich or poor.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,200
He seduces them all the same, just to satisfy his manic urge to add them to the list.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,840
In the 21st century, there are men who are really like this.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,200
They're called pickup artists, and they want you to buy their erotic memoirs.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,200
Oh man, here we go.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:27,040
A lot has been said about how pickup artists are manipulative psychos who disregard women's

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,800
wishes and use deception and coercion to have sex that's borderline rapey,

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,080
and at best, highly quote-quote problematic, unquote, and italics.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm not going to repeat those feminist objections in this video,

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,960
because I assume that my audience is familiar with them already.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
What I want to talk about instead is why.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
Why do some men become obsessed with sleeping with a lot of women in the first place?

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
I mean, even some pretty normal dudes tend to start this macho bragging

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
when they get a few too many drinks in them.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,000
A napkin and pen are produced, lists are drawn up, advanced algebra is involved,

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
there are scholastic debates about what counts as a lay.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,640
But before I penetrate this topic too deeply,

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
I want to pull out to cock block some premature objections.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
First, I'm not arguing that male promiscuity is in itself a bad thing.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
I have no problem with man-sluts.

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,880
In fact, I'm a bit of a man-slut myself.

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm just a girl who can't say no.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,640
Second, I'm not saying that game is inherently wrong,

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,680
or that men shouldn't work to improve their appearance and social skills.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Hell, I do that myself.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,320
I mean, I don't do 80 push-ups a day because I want to live longer.

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,280
Fuck that shit.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,840
I do it because I want to look good with a backward swastika

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,080
betazzled on my shaved and oiled chest.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
So why would a man want to sleep with hundreds of women?

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
Well, you might be thinking the answer is obvious,

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,240
namely that sex feels good and so it's natural that men would want to have a lot of it.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,680
Well, that's what I thought too, at least until I probed a little deeper

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
and discovered how fucking naive that is.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,600
A kind of famous pickup artist called Roosh V wrote a book called

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,520
BANG, which is a guide that purports to teach men to sleep with lots of women.

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Now, the first thing I noticed about BANG is that the act of sex itself

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,240
is not described at all until page 111 of a 140-page book,

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
and the discussion lasts less than one page.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
That's right, only four short paragraphs of this book are actually about branging.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,760
There's one paragraph about how to put a penis in a vagina,

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
one paragraph about the three sex positions Roosh knows,

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,520
one paragraph about how being good at sex doesn't matter,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,560
and one paragraph about how cunnilingus is a waste of time.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
It is good stuff.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,000
Roosh's total lack of concern for sexual technique actually comes as a real surprise,

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,160
since in the 111 pages leading up to it,

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,360
he shows meticulous care for every other aspect of seduction,

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
from the precise angle to approach a woman at the bar

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,480
to the detailed flowchart procedure for overcoming resistance to every stage leading up to sex.

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,280
It turns out that rejection is just like dying in a video game.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
You start the level over and try again.

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
Never take no for an answer.

66
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,880
The rapey stuff aside, some of the advice he gives is actually decent.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,920
Roosh knows how to single-handedly unclasp a bra in a second,

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,360
and he's scientifically discovered the least awkward way to get out a condom,

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
which he actually practices putting on quickly.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
He's probably a fucking virtuoso at putting the condom on.

71
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,040
Make a video tutorial, Roosh.

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
Stop fucking whining about feminism.

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
Get the banana out and actually teach us something, you beautiful fool.

74
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,760
It's honestly kind of a relief when you get to the page of...

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
bang, about sex, because it's the only part of the book where Roosh relaxes,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
until the moment the penis enters the vagina.

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
Congratulate yourself on the notch.

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,280
Roosh has been trying to control everything with scientific precision.

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,240
The fact that it's just anything goes with regard to sex itself is the tip-off that bang,

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
is not really a book about banging.

81
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,800
It's a guidebook on how to get a penis into a vagina by any means necessary.

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
The most absurd thing about Roosh is that he doesn't really seem to like sex very much.

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
He describes it as an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of

84
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
engorged tissue into a woman's lubricated cavity.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
And where have we heard this before?

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Because at the end of the day, sex, you're gonna be impaling her with your ugly, engorged penis.

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
It's pretty clear that Roosh is not a hedonist.

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,400
He's not pursuing pleasure.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
There's an important distinction between a genuine voluptuary,

90
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,360
someone like Casanova who actually seems to like women and enjoys spending time with them,

91
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,480
and a mere list-making maniac like Roosh or Don Giovanni.

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,880
Now, on the Don Giovanniian scale of things, I'm not really a very prolific man-slut myself,

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
but there have been certain periods in my life of, shall we say, definite man-sluttery.

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,200
And one of the things I've learned from my experience is that

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,200
jackhammering a woman for five to ten minutes is usually not enough to get her off.

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,960
If you actually care about female pleasure, you're gonna have to develop some other skills.

97
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:45,520
This has been an expensive Cunnilingus joke.

98
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
Try the wine!

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
But I guess it's not a big surprise that pickup artists don't care about female pleasure.

100
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
The more interesting and surprising thing is that they don't particularly care very

101
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,400
much about their own pleasure either, or at least it's not their primary focus.

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
The point of sex for Roosh seems to be to prove again and again that he's a real alpha male,

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
and that he's not a Warcraft-playing beta like he used to be.

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
He wants to sleep with a lot of women because of the masculine prestige he thinks it brings him,

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,040
and he wants the women he sleeps with to be conventionally beautiful for the same reason.

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
BANG!

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
It's honestly one of the most depressing books I've ever read, and I'm a Kafka fan!

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,920
It's a window into Roosh's soul, which is a void as blank as a stair and as dark as

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
the cover of the book itself.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,200
To look at the world through Roosh's eyes is to look at a world where no real companionship

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,120
between men and women is possible, where sex is a solitary act of self-assertion

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
that never leads to a connection between minds.

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,480
There's no pleasure, and no real eroticism, and BANG!

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,200
Only the cold machinations of a man who hates women,

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,480
single-mindedly obsessing over his own sexual high score.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
This is a miserable view of life, and of sex.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,800
And I say this not as someone who believes sex is sacred and only good when you're in love,

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
or anything fucking gay like that.

119
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,400
Even a one-night stand can allow you to have some kind of real connection with someone,

120
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
but only if you're honest and empathetic toward each other and aren't just using

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,040
each other's bodies so you can add another name to your fucking spreadsheet.

122
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,160
God damn.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
I always thought one of the benefits of sex is that it allows you to escape the walls

124
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,320
of your own mind prison and enjoy a less lonely existence, even if only for a couple hours.

125
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Of course, it doesn't always work out that way.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm certainly not saying unrepentant fuck-sluttery doesn't have some bad consequences.

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,920
No matter how honest and careful you try to be, if you have enough BANGS,

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,440
there's gonna come a moment when the person you were just totally casually nose strings

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
attached to banging turns to you and says,

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
I have feelings for you that I've never felt for anyone before,

131
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
and you're gonna think,

132
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
oh shit, I fucked up.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
I fucked up bad.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,040
And you did fuck up, but it's gonna happen to you too, motherfucker.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,640
You're gonna wake up one morning and the person you were just totally casually nose strings

136
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,200
attached, not a big deal, banging, is gonna walk out the door, and then suddenly,

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,680
oh god, you'll feel the fire burning in the depths of your chest, and you'll wonder,

138
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
why doesn't she love me?

139
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,840
What are these feelings that are happening to me?

140
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Am I dying?

141
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
I hate this.

142
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
This is supposed to be casual.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,400
Casual!

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,000
I didn't know my soul could tame these depths.

145
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
Contrapoints.

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
Harken to my voice.

147
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,080
What the fuck?

148
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,120
Who are you?

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,200
Why, I'm the spirit of the little thing you may have forgotten about called love.

150
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Get out of here!

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
I don't do that shit anymore.

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
Well, I'm afraid it's too late.

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,400
You see, my child is already inside of me.

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
Well, I will drown that child.

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I will feel nothing!

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Oh, god damn it.

157
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,520
God damn you.

158
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,020
That's...

159
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
It's just crass.

160
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
Try the wine, motherfucker.

161
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
All right, give me that.

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
I'll try the wine.

163
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
I'll suck your goddamn cock, too.

164
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,080
Oh, yeah.

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
No, stop.

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
We're not ending there.

167
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,520
This video needs a lesson.

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
Because I'm a moral person, god damn it.

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm a socialist feminist.

170
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
Well, look, I'll say two things.

171
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,280
First, people have this idea that feminism means that men can't be men and sex is over

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,400
and it's going to be like the matriarchal version of The Handmaid's Tale.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,920
But no, that's not what it is.

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,480
I mean, there's maybe like 1 or 0.1% of feminists who think all sex is rape and men are pigs

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,680
and all that stupid shit.

176
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,720
But those women are sad and pathetic and no one listens to them.

177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Really, the sexual requirements of feminism are very minimal.

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
Don't rape people.

179
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
Don't harass them.

180
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,520
Don't abuse them.

181
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,200
Don't shout at them in the streets.

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It's really just not that hard.

183
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
Second, for your sake, stop counting how many people you fucking slept with.

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,280
Women all seem to mysteriously have no idea how many people they've fucked.

185
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,760
This is charming and adorable and men should emulate it.

186
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
Because in the real world, Don Giovanni is a pretty unhappy thing to be.

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,480
Without Mozart's intensely erotic music propping him up, the Don would come off as cold and joyless.

188
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,400
If your goal is to live a voluptuous life, then sure, sleep with lots of women.

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,680
Sleep with lots of dudes or animals or whatever you're into.

190
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
But only if they want to.

191
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,920
And only if you want to.

192
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,880
I mean, you can embrace absolute pleasure with just one partner or even by yourself.

193
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Human life isn't very long and we're all stuck in this together.

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,960
So forget about your fucking list and go spread some pleasure in the world.

195
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
But to be clear, do not spray your white high pleasure all over anyone unless they want you to.

196
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,280
It's just, it's just not that hard to understand.

197
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,820
Goddamn.

198
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
If you liked this video so much, why don't you bang it?

199
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880

Special thanks to Roman Ilyashev, Kat Stass, Johan Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett Lathy,

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Vorone, NoNoNo, Heterodox, and the other patrons who helped me make this video.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,840
If you'd like to become a patron, check the link in the thing.

203
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Other YouTubers call it the doobly-doo.

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,280
Why do they call it that?

205
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,640
Kind of makes me angry.
