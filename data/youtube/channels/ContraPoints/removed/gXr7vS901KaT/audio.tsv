400	5520	Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni tells the story of the Spanish legend Don Juan,
5520	9840	a man who sleeps with as many women as possible because he thinks he can repent before he dies.
9840	14080	In Mozart's version, the Don seems at first like just a generic sexual predator prick.
14080	18080	When a woman accuses him of rape, he ices her old man and retreats to his palazzo.
18080	20400	But we soon learn something weirder is going on.
20400	24560	When one of his jilted lovers shows up, Don Giovanni's servant Leporello explains to her
24560	27440	that the Don keeps a catalog of all the women he's conquered.
27440	34560	640 in Italy, 231 in Germany, 100 in France, 91 in Turkey, and in Spain, 1003.
34560	38000	This catalog aria is what a boring white weirdo named Kierkegaard
38000	40000	called the most epic moment of the opera.
40000	42880	It's the moment that we learn that Don Giovanni is not just a predator,
42880	44800	but that he's actually fucking insane.
44800	48960	He doesn't care whether the women are young or old, beautiful or ugly, rich or poor.
48960	53200	He seduces them all the same, just to satisfy his manic urge to add them to the list.
53200	55840	In the 21st century, there are men who are really like this.
55840	59200	They're called pickup artists, and they want you to buy their erotic memoirs.
59920	61200	Oh man, here we go.
61200	87040	A lot has been said about how pickup artists are manipulative psychos who disregard women's
87040	90800	wishes and use deception and coercion to have sex that's borderline rapey,
90800	94080	and at best, highly quote-quote problematic, unquote, and italics.
94080	96480	I'm not going to repeat those feminist objections in this video,
96480	98960	because I assume that my audience is familiar with them already.
98960	101280	What I want to talk about instead is why.
101280	104880	Why do some men become obsessed with sleeping with a lot of women in the first place?
104880	108000	I mean, even some pretty normal dudes tend to start this macho bragging
108000	109520	when they get a few too many drinks in them.
109520	114000	A napkin and pen are produced, lists are drawn up, advanced algebra is involved,
114000	116480	there are scholastic debates about what counts as a lay.
116480	118640	But before I penetrate this topic too deeply,
118640	121680	I want to pull out to cock block some premature objections.
121680	124880	First, I'm not arguing that male promiscuity is in itself a bad thing.
124880	126720	I have no problem with man-sluts.
126720	128880	In fact, I'm a bit of a man-slut myself.
128880	132320	I'm just a girl who can't say no.
132320	134640	Second, I'm not saying that game is inherently wrong,
134640	137680	or that men shouldn't work to improve their appearance and social skills.
137680	139120	Hell, I do that myself.
139120	142320	I mean, I don't do 80 push-ups a day because I want to live longer.
142320	143280	Fuck that shit.
143280	145840	I do it because I want to look good with a backward swastika
145840	148080	betazzled on my shaved and oiled chest.
148080	150560	So why would a man want to sleep with hundreds of women?
150560	152640	Well, you might be thinking the answer is obvious,
152640	156240	namely that sex feels good and so it's natural that men would want to have a lot of it.
156240	159680	Well, that's what I thought too, at least until I probed a little deeper
159680	162080	and discovered how fucking naive that is.
162080	165600	A kind of famous pickup artist called Roosh V wrote a book called
165600	169520	BANG, which is a guide that purports to teach men to sleep with lots of women.
169520	173760	Now, the first thing I noticed about BANG is that the act of sex itself
173760	178240	is not described at all until page 111 of a 140-page book,
178240	181120	and the discussion lasts less than one page.
181120	184960	That's right, only four short paragraphs of this book are actually about branging.
184960	187760	There's one paragraph about how to put a penis in a vagina,
187760	190640	one paragraph about the three sex positions Roosh knows,
190640	193520	one paragraph about how being good at sex doesn't matter,
193520	196560	and one paragraph about how cunnilingus is a waste of time.
196560	199920	It is good stuff.
199920	204000	Roosh's total lack of concern for sexual technique actually comes as a real surprise,
204000	206160	since in the 111 pages leading up to it,
206160	209360	he shows meticulous care for every other aspect of seduction,
209360	211680	from the precise angle to approach a woman at the bar
211680	216480	to the detailed flowchart procedure for overcoming resistance to every stage leading up to sex.
216480	219280	It turns out that rejection is just like dying in a video game.
219280	221040	You start the level over and try again.
222480	223840	Never take no for an answer.
223840	226880	The rapey stuff aside, some of the advice he gives is actually decent.
226880	229920	Roosh knows how to single-handedly unclasp a bra in a second,
229920	233360	and he's scientifically discovered the least awkward way to get out a condom,
233360	235840	which he actually practices putting on quickly.
235840	239120	He's probably a fucking virtuoso at putting the condom on.
239120	241040	Make a video tutorial, Roosh.
241040	243360	Stop fucking whining about feminism.
243360	247040	Get the banana out and actually teach us something, you beautiful fool.
247040	249760	It's honestly kind of a relief when you get to the page of...
249760	254000	bang, about sex, because it's the only part of the book where Roosh relaxes,
254000	255920	until the moment the penis enters the vagina.
255920	258320	Congratulate yourself on the notch.
258320	261280	Roosh has been trying to control everything with scientific precision.
261280	266240	The fact that it's just anything goes with regard to sex itself is the tip-off that bang,
266240	268640	is not really a book about banging.
268640	272800	It's a guidebook on how to get a penis into a vagina by any means necessary.
272800	276880	The most absurd thing about Roosh is that he doesn't really seem to like sex very much.
276880	280880	He describes it as an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of
280880	284000	engorged tissue into a woman's lubricated cavity.
284000	285680	And where have we heard this before?
285680	290960	Because at the end of the day, sex, you're gonna be impaling her with your ugly, engorged penis.
290960	293120	It's pretty clear that Roosh is not a hedonist.
293120	294400	He's not pursuing pleasure.
294400	297200	There's an important distinction between a genuine voluptuary,
297200	301360	someone like Casanova who actually seems to like women and enjoys spending time with them,
301360	304480	and a mere list-making maniac like Roosh or Don Giovanni.
304480	308880	Now, on the Don Giovanniian scale of things, I'm not really a very prolific man-slut myself,
308880	312880	but there have been certain periods in my life of, shall we say, definite man-sluttery.
312880	315200	And one of the things I've learned from my experience is that
315200	319200	jackhammering a woman for five to ten minutes is usually not enough to get her off.
319200	322960	If you actually care about female pleasure, you're gonna have to develop some other skills.
334480	345520	This has been an expensive Cunnilingus joke.
346560	348160	Try the wine!
348160	351840	But I guess it's not a big surprise that pickup artists don't care about female pleasure.
351840	355040	The more interesting and surprising thing is that they don't particularly care very
355040	358400	much about their own pleasure either, or at least it's not their primary focus.
358400	362720	The point of sex for Roosh seems to be to prove again and again that he's a real alpha male,
362720	365360	and that he's not a Warcraft-playing beta like he used to be.
365360	369280	He wants to sleep with a lot of women because of the masculine prestige he thinks it brings him,
369280	373040	and he wants the women he sleeps with to be conventionally beautiful for the same reason.
373040	373680	BANG!
373680	377600	It's honestly one of the most depressing books I've ever read, and I'm a Kafka fan!
377600	381920	It's a window into Roosh's soul, which is a void as blank as a stair and as dark as
381920	383360	the cover of the book itself.
383360	387200	To look at the world through Roosh's eyes is to look at a world where no real companionship
387200	391120	between men and women is possible, where sex is a solitary act of self-assertion
391120	393360	that never leads to a connection between minds.
393360	396480	There's no pleasure, and no real eroticism, and BANG!
396480	399200	Only the cold machinations of a man who hates women,
399200	402480	single-mindedly obsessing over his own sexual high score.
402480	405040	This is a miserable view of life, and of sex.
405040	408800	And I say this not as someone who believes sex is sacred and only good when you're in love,
408800	410880	or anything fucking gay like that.
410880	414400	Even a one-night stand can allow you to have some kind of real connection with someone,
414400	417440	but only if you're honest and empathetic toward each other and aren't just using
417440	421040	each other's bodies so you can add another name to your fucking spreadsheet.
421120	422160	God damn.
422160	425680	I always thought one of the benefits of sex is that it allows you to escape the walls
425680	430320	of your own mind prison and enjoy a less lonely existence, even if only for a couple hours.
430320	432000	Of course, it doesn't always work out that way.
432000	436240	I'm certainly not saying unrepentant fuck-sluttery doesn't have some bad consequences.
436240	439920	No matter how honest and careful you try to be, if you have enough BANGS,
439920	443440	there's gonna come a moment when the person you were just totally casually nose strings
443440	446000	attached to banging turns to you and says,
446000	448720	I have feelings for you that I've never felt for anyone before,
448720	449840	and you're gonna think,
449840	452560	oh shit, I fucked up.
452560	454000	I fucked up bad.
454000	457040	And you did fuck up, but it's gonna happen to you too, motherfucker.
457040	460640	You're gonna wake up one morning and the person you were just totally casually nose strings
460640	465200	attached, not a big deal, banging, is gonna walk out the door, and then suddenly,
465200	469680	oh god, you'll feel the fire burning in the depths of your chest, and you'll wonder,
472160	475360	why doesn't she love me?
475360	477840	What are these feelings that are happening to me?
478960	480240	Am I dying?
480960	481680	I hate this.
482320	483920	This is supposed to be casual.
485440	486400	Casual!
486400	490000	I didn't know my soul could tame these depths.
490800	491840	Contrapoints.
492560	494000	Harken to my voice.
495440	496080	What the fuck?
496640	497120	Who are you?
497920	503200	Why, I'm the spirit of the little thing you may have forgotten about called love.
504320	504960	Get out of here!
505360	506560	I don't do that shit anymore.
507280	509120	Well, I'm afraid it's too late.
509120	512400	You see, my child is already inside of me.
513120	514720	Well, I will drown that child.
514720	515600	I will feel nothing!
520880	522400	Oh, god damn it.
522400	523520	God damn you.
523520	524020	That's...
525200	526400	It's just crass.
529760	531280	Try the wine, motherfucker.
531280	532480	All right, give me that.
532480	533760	I'll try the wine.
533840	535360	I'll suck your goddamn cock, too.
537360	538080	Oh, yeah.
543200	544560	No, stop.
544560	545440	We're not ending there.
546320	547520	This video needs a lesson.
548080	549760	Because I'm a moral person, god damn it.
549760	551520	I'm a socialist feminist.
551520	552960	Well, look, I'll say two things.
552960	557280	First, people have this idea that feminism means that men can't be men and sex is over
557280	560400	and it's going to be like the matriarchal version of The Handmaid's Tale.
560400	561920	But no, that's not what it is.
561920	566480	I mean, there's maybe like 1 or 0.1% of feminists who think all sex is rape and men are pigs
566480	567680	and all that stupid shit.
567680	570720	But those women are sad and pathetic and no one listens to them.
570720	573840	Really, the sexual requirements of feminism are very minimal.
573840	575360	Don't rape people.
575360	576480	Don't harass them.
576480	577520	Don't abuse them.
577520	579200	Don't shout at them in the streets.
579200	581200	It's really just not that hard.
581200	585360	Second, for your sake, stop counting how many people you fucking slept with.
585360	589280	Women all seem to mysteriously have no idea how many people they've fucked.
589280	591760	This is charming and adorable and men should emulate it.
591760	595120	Because in the real world, Don Giovanni is a pretty unhappy thing to be.
595120	600480	Without Mozart's intensely erotic music propping him up, the Don would come off as cold and joyless.
600480	604400	If your goal is to live a voluptuous life, then sure, sleep with lots of women.
604400	607680	Sleep with lots of dudes or animals or whatever you're into.
607680	608720	But only if they want to.
608720	609920	And only if you want to.
609920	614880	I mean, you can embrace absolute pleasure with just one partner or even by yourself.
614880	617760	Human life isn't very long and we're all stuck in this together.
617760	620960	So forget about your fucking list and go spread some pleasure in the world.
621760	626320	But to be clear, do not spray your white high pleasure all over anyone unless they want you to.
626320	629280	It's just, it's just not that hard to understand.
630320	630820	Goddamn.

653280	654640	Kind of makes me angry.
