00:00.400 --> 00:05.520
Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni tells the story of the Spanish legend Don Juan,

00:05.520 --> 00:09.840
a man who sleeps with as many women as possible because he thinks he can repent before he dies.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.080
In Mozart's version, the Don seems at first like just a generic sexual predator prick.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.080
When a woman accuses him of rape, he ices her old man and retreats to his palazzo.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.400
But we soon learn something weirder is going on.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.560
When one of his jilted lovers shows up, Don Giovanni's servant Leporello explains to her

00:24.560 --> 00:27.440
that the Don keeps a catalog of all the women he's conquered.

00:27.440 --> 00:34.560
640 in Italy, 231 in Germany, 100 in France, 91 in Turkey, and in Spain, 1003.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.000
This catalog aria is what a boring white weirdo named Kierkegaard

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
called the most epic moment of the opera.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.880
It's the moment that we learn that Don Giovanni is not just a predator,

00:42.880 --> 00:44.800
but that he's actually fucking insane.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.960
He doesn't care whether the women are young or old, beautiful or ugly, rich or poor.

00:48.960 --> 00:53.200
He seduces them all the same, just to satisfy his manic urge to add them to the list.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.840
In the 21st century, there are men who are really like this.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.200
They're called pickup artists, and they want you to buy their erotic memoirs.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.200
Oh man, here we go.

01:01.200 --> 01:27.040
A lot has been said about how pickup artists are manipulative psychos who disregard women's

01:27.040 --> 01:30.800
wishes and use deception and coercion to have sex that's borderline rapey,

01:30.800 --> 01:34.080
and at best, highly quote-quote problematic, unquote, and italics.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.480
I'm not going to repeat those feminist objections in this video,

01:36.480 --> 01:38.960
because I assume that my audience is familiar with them already.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.280
What I want to talk about instead is why.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.880
Why do some men become obsessed with sleeping with a lot of women in the first place?

01:44.880 --> 01:48.000
I mean, even some pretty normal dudes tend to start this macho bragging

01:48.000 --> 01:49.520
when they get a few too many drinks in them.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.000
A napkin and pen are produced, lists are drawn up, advanced algebra is involved,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.480
there are scholastic debates about what counts as a lay.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.640
But before I penetrate this topic too deeply,

01:58.640 --> 02:01.680
I want to pull out to cock block some premature objections.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.880
First, I'm not arguing that male promiscuity is in itself a bad thing.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.720
I have no problem with man-sluts.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.880
In fact, I'm a bit of a man-slut myself.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.320
I'm just a girl who can't say no.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.640
Second, I'm not saying that game is inherently wrong,

02:14.640 --> 02:17.680
or that men shouldn't work to improve their appearance and social skills.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.120
Hell, I do that myself.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.320
I mean, I don't do 80 push-ups a day because I want to live longer.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.280
Fuck that shit.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.840
I do it because I want to look good with a backward swastika

02:25.840 --> 02:28.080
betazzled on my shaved and oiled chest.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.560
So why would a man want to sleep with hundreds of women?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.640
Well, you might be thinking the answer is obvious,

02:32.640 --> 02:36.240
namely that sex feels good and so it's natural that men would want to have a lot of it.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.680
Well, that's what I thought too, at least until I probed a little deeper

02:39.680 --> 02:42.080
and discovered how fucking naive that is.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.600
A kind of famous pickup artist called Roosh V wrote a book called

02:45.600 --> 02:49.520
BANG, which is a guide that purports to teach men to sleep with lots of women.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.760
Now, the first thing I noticed about BANG is that the act of sex itself

02:53.760 --> 02:58.240
is not described at all until page 111 of a 140-page book,

02:58.240 --> 03:01.120
and the discussion lasts less than one page.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.960
That's right, only four short paragraphs of this book are actually about branging.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.760
There's one paragraph about how to put a penis in a vagina,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.640
one paragraph about the three sex positions Roosh knows,

03:10.640 --> 03:13.520
one paragraph about how being good at sex doesn't matter,

03:13.520 --> 03:16.560
and one paragraph about how cunnilingus is a waste of time.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.920
It is good stuff.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.000
Roosh's total lack of concern for sexual technique actually comes as a real surprise,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.160
since in the 111 pages leading up to it,

03:26.160 --> 03:29.360
he shows meticulous care for every other aspect of seduction,

03:29.360 --> 03:31.680
from the precise angle to approach a woman at the bar

03:31.680 --> 03:36.480
to the detailed flowchart procedure for overcoming resistance to every stage leading up to sex.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.280
It turns out that rejection is just like dying in a video game.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.040
You start the level over and try again.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.840
Never take no for an answer.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.880
The rapey stuff aside, some of the advice he gives is actually decent.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.920
Roosh knows how to single-handedly unclasp a bra in a second,

03:49.920 --> 03:53.360
and he's scientifically discovered the least awkward way to get out a condom,

03:53.360 --> 03:55.840
which he actually practices putting on quickly.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.120
He's probably a fucking virtuoso at putting the condom on.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.040
Make a video tutorial, Roosh.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.360
Stop fucking whining about feminism.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.040
Get the banana out and actually teach us something, you beautiful fool.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.760
It's honestly kind of a relief when you get to the page of...

04:09.760 --> 04:14.000
bang, about sex, because it's the only part of the book where Roosh relaxes,

04:14.000 --> 04:15.920
until the moment the penis enters the vagina.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.320
Congratulate yourself on the notch.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.280
Roosh has been trying to control everything with scientific precision.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.240
The fact that it's just anything goes with regard to sex itself is the tip-off that bang,

04:26.240 --> 04:28.640
is not really a book about banging.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.800
It's a guidebook on how to get a penis into a vagina by any means necessary.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.880
The most absurd thing about Roosh is that he doesn't really seem to like sex very much.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.880
He describes it as an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of

04:40.880 --> 04:44.000
engorged tissue into a woman's lubricated cavity.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.680
And where have we heard this before?

04:45.680 --> 04:50.960
Because at the end of the day, sex, you're gonna be impaling her with your ugly, engorged penis.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.120
It's pretty clear that Roosh is not a hedonist.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.400
He's not pursuing pleasure.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.200
There's an important distinction between a genuine voluptuary,

04:57.200 --> 05:01.360
someone like Casanova who actually seems to like women and enjoys spending time with them,

05:01.360 --> 05:04.480
and a mere list-making maniac like Roosh or Don Giovanni.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.880
Now, on the Don Giovanniian scale of things, I'm not really a very prolific man-slut myself,

05:08.880 --> 05:12.880
but there have been certain periods in my life of, shall we say, definite man-sluttery.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.200
And one of the things I've learned from my experience is that

05:15.200 --> 05:19.200
jackhammering a woman for five to ten minutes is usually not enough to get her off.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.960
If you actually care about female pleasure, you're gonna have to develop some other skills.

05:34.480 --> 05:45.520
This has been an expensive Cunnilingus joke.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.160
Try the wine!

05:48.160 --> 05:51.840
But I guess it's not a big surprise that pickup artists don't care about female pleasure.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.040
The more interesting and surprising thing is that they don't particularly care very

05:55.040 --> 05:58.400
much about their own pleasure either, or at least it's not their primary focus.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.720
The point of sex for Roosh seems to be to prove again and again that he's a real alpha male,

06:02.720 --> 06:05.360
and that he's not a Warcraft-playing beta like he used to be.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.280
He wants to sleep with a lot of women because of the masculine prestige he thinks it brings him,

06:09.280 --> 06:13.040
and he wants the women he sleeps with to be conventionally beautiful for the same reason.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.680
BANG!

06:13.680 --> 06:17.600
It's honestly one of the most depressing books I've ever read, and I'm a Kafka fan!

06:17.600 --> 06:21.920
It's a window into Roosh's soul, which is a void as blank as a stair and as dark as

06:21.920 --> 06:23.360
the cover of the book itself.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.200
To look at the world through Roosh's eyes is to look at a world where no real companionship

06:27.200 --> 06:31.120
between men and women is possible, where sex is a solitary act of self-assertion

06:31.120 --> 06:33.360
that never leads to a connection between minds.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.480
There's no pleasure, and no real eroticism, and BANG!

06:36.480 --> 06:39.200
Only the cold machinations of a man who hates women,

06:39.200 --> 06:42.480
single-mindedly obsessing over his own sexual high score.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.040
This is a miserable view of life, and of sex.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.800
And I say this not as someone who believes sex is sacred and only good when you're in love,

06:48.800 --> 06:50.880
or anything fucking gay like that.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.400
Even a one-night stand can allow you to have some kind of real connection with someone,

06:54.400 --> 06:57.440
but only if you're honest and empathetic toward each other and aren't just using

06:57.440 --> 07:01.040
each other's bodies so you can add another name to your fucking spreadsheet.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.160
God damn.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.680
I always thought one of the benefits of sex is that it allows you to escape the walls

07:05.680 --> 07:10.320
of your own mind prison and enjoy a less lonely existence, even if only for a couple hours.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.000
Of course, it doesn't always work out that way.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.240
I'm certainly not saying unrepentant fuck-sluttery doesn't have some bad consequences.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.920
No matter how honest and careful you try to be, if you have enough BANGS,

07:19.920 --> 07:23.440
there's gonna come a moment when the person you were just totally casually nose strings

07:23.440 --> 07:26.000
attached to banging turns to you and says,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.720
I have feelings for you that I've never felt for anyone before,

07:28.720 --> 07:29.840
and you're gonna think,

07:29.840 --> 07:32.560
oh shit, I fucked up.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.000
I fucked up bad.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.040
And you did fuck up, but it's gonna happen to you too, motherfucker.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.640
You're gonna wake up one morning and the person you were just totally casually nose strings

07:40.640 --> 07:45.200
attached, not a big deal, banging, is gonna walk out the door, and then suddenly,

07:45.200 --> 07:49.680
oh god, you'll feel the fire burning in the depths of your chest, and you'll wonder,

07:52.160 --> 07:55.360
why doesn't she love me?

07:55.360 --> 07:57.840
What are these feelings that are happening to me?

07:58.960 --> 08:00.240
Am I dying?

08:00.960 --> 08:01.680
I hate this.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.920
This is supposed to be casual.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.400
Casual!

08:06.400 --> 08:10.000
I didn't know my soul could tame these depths.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.840
Contrapoints.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.000
Harken to my voice.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.080
What the fuck?

08:16.640 --> 08:17.120
Who are you?

08:17.920 --> 08:23.200
Why, I'm the spirit of the little thing you may have forgotten about called love.

08:24.320 --> 08:24.960
Get out of here!

08:25.360 --> 08:26.560
I don't do that shit anymore.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.120
Well, I'm afraid it's too late.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.400
You see, my child is already inside of me.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.720
Well, I will drown that child.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.600
I will feel nothing!

08:40.880 --> 08:42.400
Oh, god damn it.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.520
God damn you.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.020
That's...

08:45.200 --> 08:46.400
It's just crass.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.280
Try the wine, motherfucker.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.480
All right, give me that.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.760
I'll try the wine.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.360
I'll suck your goddamn cock, too.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.080
Oh, yeah.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.560
No, stop.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.440
We're not ending there.

09:06.320 --> 09:07.520
This video needs a lesson.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.760
Because I'm a moral person, god damn it.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.520
I'm a socialist feminist.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.960
Well, look, I'll say two things.

09:12.960 --> 09:17.280
First, people have this idea that feminism means that men can't be men and sex is over

09:17.280 --> 09:20.400
and it's going to be like the matriarchal version of The Handmaid's Tale.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.920
But no, that's not what it is.

09:21.920 --> 09:26.480
I mean, there's maybe like 1 or 0.1% of feminists who think all sex is rape and men are pigs

09:26.480 --> 09:27.680
and all that stupid shit.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.720
But those women are sad and pathetic and no one listens to them.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.840
Really, the sexual requirements of feminism are very minimal.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.360
Don't rape people.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.480
Don't harass them.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.520
Don't abuse them.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.200
Don't shout at them in the streets.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.200
It's really just not that hard.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.360
Second, for your sake, stop counting how many people you fucking slept with.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.280
Women all seem to mysteriously have no idea how many people they've fucked.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.760
This is charming and adorable and men should emulate it.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.120
Because in the real world, Don Giovanni is a pretty unhappy thing to be.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.480
Without Mozart's intensely erotic music propping him up, the Don would come off as cold and joyless.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.400
If your goal is to live a voluptuous life, then sure, sleep with lots of women.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.680
Sleep with lots of dudes or animals or whatever you're into.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.720
But only if they want to.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.920
And only if you want to.

10:09.920 --> 10:14.880
I mean, you can embrace absolute pleasure with just one partner or even by yourself.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.760
Human life isn't very long and we're all stuck in this together.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.960
So forget about your fucking list and go spread some pleasure in the world.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.320
But to be clear, do not spray your white high pleasure all over anyone unless they want you to.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.280
It's just, it's just not that hard to understand.

10:30.320 --> 10:30.820
Goddamn.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.600
If you liked this video so much, why don't you bang it?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.880
But also click like, please.

10:37.520 --> 10:43.200
Special thanks to Roman Ilyashev, Kat Stass, Johan Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett Lathy,

10:43.200 --> 10:48.000
Vorone, NoNoNo, Heterodox, and the other patrons who helped me make this video.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.840
If you'd like to become a patron, check the link in the thing.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.160
Other YouTubers call it the doobly-doo.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.280
Why do they call it that?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.640
Kind of makes me angry.
