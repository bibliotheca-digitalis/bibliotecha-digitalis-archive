00:00.000 --> 00:17.120
I guess I should probably cut back on the drinking, but it makes me feel good.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.600
I mean, I can't sleep for more than two hours at a time, and I do not get erections anymore.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.720
But apart from that, it's fine.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.920
Come on, I'm gonna go stand in front of books so you're subconsciously reminded how smart

00:26.920 --> 00:27.920
I am.

00:27.920 --> 00:28.920
Hello.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.000
When I first heard the term Social Justice Warrior, it immediately made sense to me,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.840
because I thought it referred to the kind of person who writes angry Facebook posts

00:37.840 --> 00:42.480
because a white guy at a college 2,000 miles away has a culturally-appropriated hairstyle,

00:42.480 --> 00:46.680
or the kind of person who can't watch a single movie without complaining about how sexist

00:46.680 --> 00:47.680
the characters are.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.640
Like, he's the villain of the movie!

00:49.640 --> 00:50.640
Of course he's fucking sexist!

00:50.640 --> 00:52.200
You're not supposed to like him!

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
Aaaah!

00:53.200 --> 00:57.240
But then I came on YouTube and discovered that SJW apparently just means anyone to the

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
left of Hitler.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.320
So I guess I'm an SJW, but I didn't used to be.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.760
I mean, I was always pretty progressive on race issues, but it did take me a while to

01:05.760 --> 01:06.960
warm up to feminism.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.760
I think it might be interesting for me to discuss my transition from misogynist shitlord

01:10.760 --> 01:14.360
to feminist mangina, since debate about this topic often feels futile.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.560
For the feminists out there, I am proof that it's possible for people to change their minds

01:18.560 --> 01:19.560
on this subject.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.760
And for anyone who's a shitlord watching this, you may want to listen up so you can find

01:22.760 --> 01:24.760
out how the brainwashing actually happens.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.640
What a bunch of fucking drama queens.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.760
So when I say I used to be a misogynist, I don't mean how I was raping people.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.760
You know, it was the little things.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.360
For instance, I remember in high school English class I loved Homer and hated Jane Austen,

01:38.360 --> 01:42.640
although I barely read either of them, pretty much just because Homer was about war, which

01:42.640 --> 01:47.120
is a man thing, so I assumed it would be serious and profound, whereas Jane Austen is about

01:47.120 --> 01:51.000
engagements, which is a woman thing, so I assumed it would be effeminate and therefore

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
trivial.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.040
At my lowest point, this would be about six years ago, I uploaded a YouTube video titled

01:56.040 --> 02:01.520
Questions for Feminists, which was a condescending and disingenuous gotcha-type video that I'm

02:01.520 --> 02:02.920
now thoroughly ashamed of.

02:02.920 --> 02:07.040
I mean, you'd have to be a real piece of shit to make a video like that these days.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
Awwww.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.960
Anyway, I went to college and studied first music and then neuroscience.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I'd taken a bunch of science, statistics, and philosophy classes, but I was required

02:25.000 --> 02:27.440
to take an English class as part of the core curriculum.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.440
I wanted to take the Shakespeare class, but that was full, so I looked for an alternative

02:31.440 --> 02:35.440
and stumbled across a course called Introduction to Critical Methods.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.120
I read the course description and it looked like a bunch of nammy-pammy leftist gibberish,

02:39.120 --> 02:43.560
but I decided to take the class anyway because I've always been kind of curious to understand

02:43.560 --> 02:47.240
people I disagree with, which is probably why I'm so obsessed with YouTube shitlords

02:47.240 --> 02:48.240
now.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.360
I went into this class basically for the purpose of making fun of it.

02:51.360 --> 02:55.280
I remember on the first day, I jotted down in my notes in quotation marks a bunch of

02:55.280 --> 02:58.440
the professor's phrases and buzzwords that I found ridiculous.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.880
I was a big opera fan back then, so when the professor dismissed it as a bourgeois spectacle,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.480
I got super mad.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.880
Opera is not bourgeois!

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
It's universal!

03:06.880 --> 03:07.880
Everybody likes it!

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
Even Charlene!

03:08.880 --> 03:12.680
The pivot point happened when we got our first reading assignment, which was this book, Ways

03:12.680 --> 03:14.580
of Seeing, by John Berger.

03:14.580 --> 03:19.140
It's a work of Marxist feminist art criticism that describes the social role of oil paintings

03:19.140 --> 03:20.140
and advertisements.

03:20.140 --> 03:24.500
When I first read it, it actually made me really angry, but it also led me to this kind

03:24.500 --> 03:25.500
of epiphany.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.260
It seems like such an obvious and trivial point now, but until I read this, it actually

03:29.260 --> 03:33.620
had never occurred to me that so much historical art basically celebrates the perspective of

03:33.620 --> 03:34.620
rich white men.

03:34.620 --> 03:38.260
And I don't mean to suggest that the perspective of white men is bad, it isn't.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.740
It's just that until I read this book, I didn't even really think of it as a perspective.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.900
I just saw it as the default universal way of looking at things.

03:45.900 --> 03:50.580
It didn't really occur to me that women or, say, Africans might look at things differently.

03:50.580 --> 03:54.060
But once I read this book, I saw things differently.

03:54.060 --> 03:58.620
I started seeing white male dominance in all kinds of things like movies and books and

03:58.620 --> 03:59.620
video games.

03:59.620 --> 04:03.580
It made me question what had been this implicit white male supremacy that I'd carried with

04:03.580 --> 04:07.540
me all my life, and I suddenly became much more willing to listen to the perspectives

04:07.540 --> 04:11.460
of women and other kinds of people, even when I found what they were saying counterintuitive

04:11.460 --> 04:12.460
at first.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.220
But that was one crack in the shitlord's shell.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.820
And the same year I read this book, I had another experience that changed my feelings

04:17.820 --> 04:18.820
about feminism.

04:18.820 --> 04:23.300
I was standing on the subway platform and this woman with really nice legs walked by.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.420
And I didn't say anything, because I actually have never catcalled anyone, but I did kind

04:28.420 --> 04:31.460
of side-eye down because she had really nice legs.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.140
What was I supposed to do?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.140
Not look at them?

04:34.140 --> 04:36.780
I mean, I must have done this hundreds of times before, and no one had ever called me

04:36.780 --> 04:40.020
out on it, so I guess I must have thought I was smoother than I was.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.820
So this time, the woman actually confronted me about it.

04:42.820 --> 04:45.780
She made this gesture like, hey, like I can see what you're doing!

04:45.780 --> 04:48.940
And yeah, I was embarrassed, but I was more just shocked.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.860
Until then, it actually hadn't sunk in that she could see me as well as I could see her,

04:52.860 --> 04:56.940
and that I wasn't just an invisible agent, and she wasn't just a passive object.

04:56.940 --> 05:01.700
And again, it sounds intuitive and obvious, but for a lot of men, including me, it apparently

05:01.700 --> 05:02.700
isn't.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.940
And what's funny is she probably went home after that and was like, what an asshole!

05:05.940 --> 05:10.660
Men are hopeless, and she'll never know that in fact, because of what she did, I went home

05:10.660 --> 05:12.700
and completely re-examined my life.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.500
What have I done?

05:17.940 --> 05:21.340
So for a while after that, every time I would pass a gorgeous person on the street, I would

05:21.340 --> 05:25.180
lock my eyes straight ahead of me and think to myself, eyes front and center, Private,

05:25.180 --> 05:27.260
or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.740
But that became untenable pretty quickly, so what I usually do now when I walk onto

05:30.740 --> 05:32.900
the subway is, ah geez, are we doing this?

05:32.940 --> 05:36.500
Alright, I'll just look at everything so that it seems normal.

05:36.500 --> 05:41.220
Looking at the tile, looking at the bag, looking at the floor, looking at the electrical box,

05:41.220 --> 05:43.900
looking at the book, and now...

05:43.900 --> 05:47.900
But I'm not staring, I'm just glancing, and that's okay, there's nothing wrong with glancing.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.180
I glanced at everything.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.340
I glanced at the tile.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.860
It's completely non-discriminatory.

05:51.860 --> 05:52.860
It's like, equality.

05:52.860 --> 05:54.740
Isn't that what feminists want?

05:54.740 --> 05:57.580
I'm not like those other creepy guys, I'm a cool, feminist guy.

05:57.580 --> 05:58.940
I was looking at the tile.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.580
Tell me I'm a cool guy who understands feminism.

06:00.580 --> 06:01.580
That'll date me.

06:01.580 --> 06:03.060
Tell me I'm a nice guy, you goddamn bitch.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.060
This is not going well.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.820
Let's get back on track here.

06:07.820 --> 06:10.900
I guess the upshot is that the anti-social justice league is right.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.060
Universities are where the brainwashing happens.

06:13.060 --> 06:19.420
But, and hear me out here, what if brainwashing is just a word for education that you disagree with?

06:20.420 --> 06:23.980
I mean, I went into college prepared to mock all of this, and it's not like my spirit was

06:23.980 --> 06:28.540
broken and feminism was forced on me with the aid of experimental drugs and hypnosis.

06:28.540 --> 06:31.500
I mean, I just kept somewhat open-minded and read a book.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.580
But I guess the moral is, if you want to avoid becoming a feminist, don't read any books

06:35.580 --> 06:39.820
about it, write letters to universities asking them to protect free speech by please banning

06:39.820 --> 06:44.580
any courses that disagree with you, and if any woman ever accuses you of being creepy,

06:44.580 --> 06:47.060
definitely don't do any serious introspection about it.

06:47.060 --> 06:49.220
Because deep down you know that you're not a creep.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.860
In fact, you'd better do even more of the thing that she said was creepy, just to prove

06:52.860 --> 06:57.420
she's fucking wrong, and because you need to prove that she didn't get to you at all

06:57.500 --> 07:01.340
and that you're not angry, because you looked at the tile, you were looking at the tile,

07:01.340 --> 07:03.020
and is it illegal now to have eyes?

07:03.020 --> 07:05.820
I was looking at the goddamn tile, Wendy!

07:05.820 --> 07:26.300
KDK12 calling KDK1, if you liked this video, please send help.

07:27.020 --> 07:40.780
And now, the thanking of the patrons!

07:43.820 --> 07:45.420
You may kiss the bride.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.380
I was looking at the tile.
