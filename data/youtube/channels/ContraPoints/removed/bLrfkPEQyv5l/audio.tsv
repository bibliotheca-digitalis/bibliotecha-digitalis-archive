0	17120	I guess I should probably cut back on the drinking, but it makes me feel good.
17120	21600	I mean, I can't sleep for more than two hours at a time, and I do not get erections anymore.
21600	23720	But apart from that, it's fine.
23720	26920	Come on, I'm gonna go stand in front of books so you're subconsciously reminded how smart
26920	27920	I am.
27920	28920	Hello.
29640	34000	When I first heard the term Social Justice Warrior, it immediately made sense to me,
34000	37840	because I thought it referred to the kind of person who writes angry Facebook posts
37840	42480	because a white guy at a college 2,000 miles away has a culturally-appropriated hairstyle,
42480	46680	or the kind of person who can't watch a single movie without complaining about how sexist
46680	47680	the characters are.
47680	49640	Like, he's the villain of the movie!
49640	50640	Of course he's fucking sexist!
50640	52200	You're not supposed to like him!
52200	53200	Aaaah!
53200	57240	But then I came on YouTube and discovered that SJW apparently just means anyone to the
57240	58240	left of Hitler.
58240	62320	So I guess I'm an SJW, but I didn't used to be.
62320	65760	I mean, I was always pretty progressive on race issues, but it did take me a while to
65760	66960	warm up to feminism.
66960	70760	I think it might be interesting for me to discuss my transition from misogynist shitlord
70760	74360	to feminist mangina, since debate about this topic often feels futile.
74360	78560	For the feminists out there, I am proof that it's possible for people to change their minds
78560	79560	on this subject.
79560	82760	And for anyone who's a shitlord watching this, you may want to listen up so you can find
82760	84760	out how the brainwashing actually happens.
85760	87640	What a bunch of fucking drama queens.
87640	90760	So when I say I used to be a misogynist, I don't mean how I was raping people.
90760	92760	You know, it was the little things.
92760	98360	For instance, I remember in high school English class I loved Homer and hated Jane Austen,
98360	102640	although I barely read either of them, pretty much just because Homer was about war, which
102640	107120	is a man thing, so I assumed it would be serious and profound, whereas Jane Austen is about
107120	111000	engagements, which is a woman thing, so I assumed it would be effeminate and therefore
111000	112000	trivial.
112240	116040	At my lowest point, this would be about six years ago, I uploaded a YouTube video titled
116040	121520	Questions for Feminists, which was a condescending and disingenuous gotcha-type video that I'm
121520	122920	now thoroughly ashamed of.
122920	127040	I mean, you'd have to be a real piece of shit to make a video like that these days.
127040	128040	Awwww.
138040	140960	Anyway, I went to college and studied first music and then neuroscience.
141000	145000	I'd taken a bunch of science, statistics, and philosophy classes, but I was required
145000	147440	to take an English class as part of the core curriculum.
147440	151440	I wanted to take the Shakespeare class, but that was full, so I looked for an alternative
151440	155440	and stumbled across a course called Introduction to Critical Methods.
155440	159120	I read the course description and it looked like a bunch of nammy-pammy leftist gibberish,
159120	163560	but I decided to take the class anyway because I've always been kind of curious to understand
163560	167240	people I disagree with, which is probably why I'm so obsessed with YouTube shitlords
167240	168240	now.
168520	171360	I went into this class basically for the purpose of making fun of it.
171360	175280	I remember on the first day, I jotted down in my notes in quotation marks a bunch of
175280	178440	the professor's phrases and buzzwords that I found ridiculous.
178440	182880	I was a big opera fan back then, so when the professor dismissed it as a bourgeois spectacle,
182880	184480	I got super mad.
184480	185880	Opera is not bourgeois!
185880	186880	It's universal!
186880	187880	Everybody likes it!
187880	188880	Even Charlene!
188880	192680	The pivot point happened when we got our first reading assignment, which was this book, Ways
192680	194580	of Seeing, by John Berger.
194580	199140	It's a work of Marxist feminist art criticism that describes the social role of oil paintings
199140	200140	and advertisements.
200140	204500	When I first read it, it actually made me really angry, but it also led me to this kind
204500	205500	of epiphany.
205500	209260	It seems like such an obvious and trivial point now, but until I read this, it actually
209260	213620	had never occurred to me that so much historical art basically celebrates the perspective of
213620	214620	rich white men.
214620	218260	And I don't mean to suggest that the perspective of white men is bad, it isn't.
218260	222740	It's just that until I read this book, I didn't even really think of it as a perspective.
222900	225900	I just saw it as the default universal way of looking at things.
225900	230580	It didn't really occur to me that women or, say, Africans might look at things differently.
230580	234060	But once I read this book, I saw things differently.
234060	238620	I started seeing white male dominance in all kinds of things like movies and books and
238620	239620	video games.
239620	243580	It made me question what had been this implicit white male supremacy that I'd carried with
243580	247540	me all my life, and I suddenly became much more willing to listen to the perspectives
247540	251460	of women and other kinds of people, even when I found what they were saying counterintuitive
251460	252460	at first.
252460	254220	But that was one crack in the shitlord's shell.
254220	257820	And the same year I read this book, I had another experience that changed my feelings
257820	258820	about feminism.
258820	263300	I was standing on the subway platform and this woman with really nice legs walked by.
263300	268420	And I didn't say anything, because I actually have never catcalled anyone, but I did kind
268420	271460	of side-eye down because she had really nice legs.
271460	273140	What was I supposed to do?
273140	274140	Not look at them?
274140	276780	I mean, I must have done this hundreds of times before, and no one had ever called me
276780	280020	out on it, so I guess I must have thought I was smoother than I was.
280060	282820	So this time, the woman actually confronted me about it.
282820	285780	She made this gesture like, hey, like I can see what you're doing!
285780	288940	And yeah, I was embarrassed, but I was more just shocked.
288940	292860	Until then, it actually hadn't sunk in that she could see me as well as I could see her,
292860	296940	and that I wasn't just an invisible agent, and she wasn't just a passive object.
296940	301700	And again, it sounds intuitive and obvious, but for a lot of men, including me, it apparently
301700	302700	isn't.
302700	305940	And what's funny is she probably went home after that and was like, what an asshole!
305940	310660	Men are hopeless, and she'll never know that in fact, because of what she did, I went home
310660	312700	and completely re-examined my life.
312700	315500	What have I done?
317940	321340	So for a while after that, every time I would pass a gorgeous person on the street, I would
321340	325180	lock my eyes straight ahead of me and think to myself, eyes front and center, Private,
325180	327260	or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.
327260	330740	But that became untenable pretty quickly, so what I usually do now when I walk onto
330740	332900	the subway is, ah geez, are we doing this?
332940	336500	Alright, I'll just look at everything so that it seems normal.
336500	341220	Looking at the tile, looking at the bag, looking at the floor, looking at the electrical box,
341220	343900	looking at the book, and now...
343900	347900	But I'm not staring, I'm just glancing, and that's okay, there's nothing wrong with glancing.
347900	349180	I glanced at everything.
349180	350340	I glanced at the tile.
350340	351860	It's completely non-discriminatory.
351860	352860	It's like, equality.
352860	354740	Isn't that what feminists want?
354740	357580	I'm not like those other creepy guys, I'm a cool, feminist guy.
357580	358940	I was looking at the tile.
358940	360580	Tell me I'm a cool guy who understands feminism.
360580	361580	That'll date me.
361580	363060	Tell me I'm a nice guy, you goddamn bitch.
365060	366060	This is not going well.
366060	367820	Let's get back on track here.
367820	370900	I guess the upshot is that the anti-social justice league is right.
370900	373060	Universities are where the brainwashing happens.
373060	379420	But, and hear me out here, what if brainwashing is just a word for education that you disagree with?
380420	383980	I mean, I went into college prepared to mock all of this, and it's not like my spirit was
383980	388540	broken and feminism was forced on me with the aid of experimental drugs and hypnosis.
388540	391500	I mean, I just kept somewhat open-minded and read a book.
391500	395580	But I guess the moral is, if you want to avoid becoming a feminist, don't read any books
395580	399820	about it, write letters to universities asking them to protect free speech by please banning
399820	404580	any courses that disagree with you, and if any woman ever accuses you of being creepy,
404580	407060	definitely don't do any serious introspection about it.
407060	409220	Because deep down you know that you're not a creep.
409220	412860	In fact, you'd better do even more of the thing that she said was creepy, just to prove
412860	417420	she's fucking wrong, and because you need to prove that she didn't get to you at all
417500	421340	and that you're not angry, because you looked at the tile, you were looking at the tile,
421340	423020	and is it illegal now to have eyes?
423020	425820	I was looking at the goddamn tile, Wendy!
425820	446300	KDK12 calling KDK1, if you liked this video, please send help.
447020	460780	And now, the thanking of the patrons!
463820	465420	You may kiss the bride.
465420	466380	I was looking at the tile.
