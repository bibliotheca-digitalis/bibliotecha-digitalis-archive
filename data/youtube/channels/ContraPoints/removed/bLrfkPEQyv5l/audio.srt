1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,120
I guess I should probably cut back on the drinking, but it makes me feel good.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,600
I mean, I can't sleep for more than two hours at a time, and I do not get erections anymore.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,720
But apart from that, it's fine.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,920
Come on, I'm gonna go stand in front of books so you're subconsciously reminded how smart

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
I am.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Hello.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,000
When I first heard the term Social Justice Warrior, it immediately made sense to me,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
because I thought it referred to the kind of person who writes angry Facebook posts

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,480
because a white guy at a college 2,000 miles away has a culturally-appropriated hairstyle,

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,680
or the kind of person who can't watch a single movie without complaining about how sexist

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
the characters are.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,640
Like, he's the villain of the movie!

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Of course he's fucking sexist!

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,200
You're not supposed to like him!

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Aaaah!

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,240
But then I came on YouTube and discovered that SJW apparently just means anyone to the

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
left of Hitler.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,320
So I guess I'm an SJW, but I didn't used to be.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
I mean, I was always pretty progressive on race issues, but it did take me a while to

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
warm up to feminism.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,760
I think it might be interesting for me to discuss my transition from misogynist shitlord

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,360
to feminist mangina, since debate about this topic often feels futile.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,560
For the feminists out there, I am proof that it's possible for people to change their minds

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
on this subject.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,760
And for anyone who's a shitlord watching this, you may want to listen up so you can find

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
out how the brainwashing actually happens.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,640
What a bunch of fucking drama queens.

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,760
So when I say I used to be a misogynist, I don't mean how I was raping people.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
You know, it was the little things.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,360
For instance, I remember in high school English class I loved Homer and hated Jane Austen,

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,640
although I barely read either of them, pretty much just because Homer was about war, which

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,120
is a man thing, so I assumed it would be serious and profound, whereas Jane Austen is about

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,000
engagements, which is a woman thing, so I assumed it would be effeminate and therefore

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
trivial.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,040
At my lowest point, this would be about six years ago, I uploaded a YouTube video titled

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,520
Questions for Feminists, which was a condescending and disingenuous gotcha-type video that I'm

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
now thoroughly ashamed of.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,040
I mean, you'd have to be a real piece of shit to make a video like that these days.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Awwww.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,960
Anyway, I went to college and studied first music and then neuroscience.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'd taken a bunch of science, statistics, and philosophy classes, but I was required

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,440
to take an English class as part of the core curriculum.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I wanted to take the Shakespeare class, but that was full, so I looked for an alternative

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
and stumbled across a course called Introduction to Critical Methods.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,120
I read the course description and it looked like a bunch of nammy-pammy leftist gibberish,

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,560
but I decided to take the class anyway because I've always been kind of curious to understand

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,240
people I disagree with, which is probably why I'm so obsessed with YouTube shitlords

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
now.

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,360
I went into this class basically for the purpose of making fun of it.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I remember on the first day, I jotted down in my notes in quotation marks a bunch of

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,440
the professor's phrases and buzzwords that I found ridiculous.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,880
I was a big opera fan back then, so when the professor dismissed it as a bourgeois spectacle,

53
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,480
I got super mad.

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,880
Opera is not bourgeois!

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
It's universal!

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Everybody likes it!

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Even Charlene!

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,680
The pivot point happened when we got our first reading assignment, which was this book, Ways

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,580
of Seeing, by John Berger.

60
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,140
It's a work of Marxist feminist art criticism that describes the social role of oil paintings

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
and advertisements.

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,500
When I first read it, it actually made me really angry, but it also led me to this kind

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
of epiphany.

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,260
It seems like such an obvious and trivial point now, but until I read this, it actually

65
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,620
had never occurred to me that so much historical art basically celebrates the perspective of

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
rich white men.

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,260
And I don't mean to suggest that the perspective of white men is bad, it isn't.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,740
It's just that until I read this book, I didn't even really think of it as a perspective.

69
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,900
I just saw it as the default universal way of looking at things.

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,580
It didn't really occur to me that women or, say, Africans might look at things differently.

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,060
But once I read this book, I saw things differently.

72
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,620
I started seeing white male dominance in all kinds of things like movies and books and

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
video games.

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,580
It made me question what had been this implicit white male supremacy that I'd carried with

75
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,540
me all my life, and I suddenly became much more willing to listen to the perspectives

76
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,460
of women and other kinds of people, even when I found what they were saying counterintuitive

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
at first.

78
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,220
But that was one crack in the shitlord's shell.

79
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,820
And the same year I read this book, I had another experience that changed my feelings

80
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
about feminism.

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,300
I was standing on the subway platform and this woman with really nice legs walked by.

82
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,420
And I didn't say anything, because I actually have never catcalled anyone, but I did kind

83
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,460
of side-eye down because she had really nice legs.

84
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,140
What was I supposed to do?

85
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
Not look at them?

86
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,780
I mean, I must have done this hundreds of times before, and no one had ever called me

87
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,020
out on it, so I guess I must have thought I was smoother than I was.

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,820
So this time, the woman actually confronted me about it.

89
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,780
She made this gesture like, hey, like I can see what you're doing!

90
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,940
And yeah, I was embarrassed, but I was more just shocked.

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,860
Until then, it actually hadn't sunk in that she could see me as well as I could see her,

92
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,940
and that I wasn't just an invisible agent, and she wasn't just a passive object.

93
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,700
And again, it sounds intuitive and obvious, but for a lot of men, including me, it apparently

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
isn't.

95
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,940
And what's funny is she probably went home after that and was like, what an asshole!

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,660
Men are hopeless, and she'll never know that in fact, because of what she did, I went home

97
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,700
and completely re-examined my life.

98
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,500
What have I done?

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,340
So for a while after that, every time I would pass a gorgeous person on the street, I would

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,180
lock my eyes straight ahead of me and think to myself, eyes front and center, Private,

101
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,260
or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.

102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,740
But that became untenable pretty quickly, so what I usually do now when I walk onto

103
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,900
the subway is, ah geez, are we doing this?

104
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,500
Alright, I'll just look at everything so that it seems normal.

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,220
Looking at the tile, looking at the bag, looking at the floor, looking at the electrical box,

106
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,900
looking at the book, and now...

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,900
But I'm not staring, I'm just glancing, and that's okay, there's nothing wrong with glancing.

108
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,180
I glanced at everything.

109
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,340
I glanced at the tile.

110
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,860
It's completely non-discriminatory.

111
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
It's like, equality.

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,740
Isn't that what feminists want?

113
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,580
I'm not like those other creepy guys, I'm a cool, feminist guy.

114
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,940
I was looking at the tile.

115
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,580
Tell me I'm a cool guy who understands feminism.

116
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
That'll date me.

117
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,060
Tell me I'm a nice guy, you goddamn bitch.

118
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
This is not going well.

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,820
Let's get back on track here.

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,900
I guess the upshot is that the anti-social justice league is right.

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,060
Universities are where the brainwashing happens.

122
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,420
But, and hear me out here, what if brainwashing is just a word for education that you disagree with?

123
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,980
I mean, I went into college prepared to mock all of this, and it's not like my spirit was

124
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,540
broken and feminism was forced on me with the aid of experimental drugs and hypnosis.

125
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,500
I mean, I just kept somewhat open-minded and read a book.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,580
But I guess the moral is, if you want to avoid becoming a feminist, don't read any books

127
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,820
about it, write letters to universities asking them to protect free speech by please banning

128
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,580
any courses that disagree with you, and if any woman ever accuses you of being creepy,

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,060
definitely don't do any serious introspection about it.

130
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,220
Because deep down you know that you're not a creep.

131
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,860
In fact, you'd better do even more of the thing that she said was creepy, just to prove

132
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,420
she's fucking wrong, and because you need to prove that she didn't get to you at all

133
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,340
and that you're not angry, because you looked at the tile, you were looking at the tile,

134
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,020
and is it illegal now to have eyes?

135
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,820
I was looking at the goddamn tile, Wendy!

136
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:26,300
KDK12 calling KDK1, if you liked this video, please send help.

137
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:40,780
And now, the thanking of the patrons!

138
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,420
You may kiss the bride.

139
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,380
I was looking at the tile.
