0	12880	You know, every once in a while I'll meet a nice Christian, and on those occasions I'll
12880	19640	often get a sort of a nasty feeling inside, a little pang of guilt or regret that I'm
19640	28360	so hard on their religion, that I'm so aggressive and so critical of their beliefs.
28360	36140	That feeling never lasts very long. I have something hanging on my wall, and whenever
36140	44880	I look at it, that feeling of regret melts away.
44880	49720	Let's take a look at some of the things on my wall. I have an Einstein poster that always
49720	55560	lists my spirit. I have some music posters. I have this Picasso poster that's melancholy
55560	61600	but beautiful nonetheless. But I also have something else, something of a different sort.
61600	67600	Hell, by Hieronymus Bosch. Now why do I keep this terrifying and disturbing picture around?
67600	75440	Why do I look at it every day? Because it reminds me why I do what I do. It reminds
75440	79500	me what half the men and women around me really believe. It reminds me what they think will
79500	83840	happen to me, and the ones I love after we are dead. It reminds me what they think I
83840	91000	deserve. Sure, it's easy to dismiss Christianity as harmless, superstitional. Jesus, meek and
91000	95440	mild, just a little something to bring comfort to people and get them through the day. But
95440	99960	a closer examination of the beliefs of the believer and of scripture itself will reveal
99960	105120	that something very upsetting and awful is under all of this. Mainstream Christianity
105120	110040	tells us that those of us who do not believe face eternal punishment after death. Fiery
110040	117040	torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, perishing, death, condemnation, judgment, wrath, everlasting
117040	122120	destruction, raging fire, blackest darkness and burning sulfur, where we will be tormented
122120	128120	day and night, forever and ever. And this is what you believe I deserve. This is what
128120	132560	you believe I have earned by my refusal to believe as you believe. And you expect me
132560	137360	to respect this notion? This is a barbaric and ancient superstition. The world needs
137360	142040	to wake up and see it for what it is. This is not the 12th century anymore. Our species
142040	147720	has survived the 20th century. We know what hell on earth looks like. We have seen raging
147720	153440	fire. We have seen weeping and death. We have seen torment day and night, and yet you dare
153440	157640	to suggest that a loving God endorses this. After so many men and women have suffered
157640	163360	on earth, you dare to suggest that a loving God sanctions an eternal genocide of his nature.
163360	167200	I still have time to save myself, you say. Well, what of the billions who are already
167200	171720	lost, who are already burning? Are you indifferent to their suffering? Do their cries for mercy
171720	178480	fall in different years? Is not an infinite punishment for a finite crime infinitely unjust?
178480	182320	And yet, this is what you announce to be the fate of myself and many of those I love and
182320	187680	many of those I hate. You worship and praise a God who judges me, who sentences me to eternal
187680	191520	torment, and yet I'm the one who's supposed to shop and tolerate your beliefs? I don't
191520	195720	think so. How dare you praise such a God? How can you even look me in the eye knowing
195720	199600	what you believe to be my fate? How dare you worship a God that would do that to me, to
199600	208160	anyone? Why do I even talk to you? I talk to you because I have no choice.
