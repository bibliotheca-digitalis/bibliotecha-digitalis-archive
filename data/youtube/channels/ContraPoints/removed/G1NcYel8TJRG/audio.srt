1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
You know, every once in a while I'll meet a nice Christian, and on those occasions I'll

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,640
often get a sort of a nasty feeling inside, a little pang of guilt or regret that I'm

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:28,360
so hard on their religion, that I'm so aggressive and so critical of their beliefs.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:36,140
That feeling never lasts very long. I have something hanging on my wall, and whenever

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:44,880
I look at it, that feeling of regret melts away.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Let's take a look at some of the things on my wall. I have an Einstein poster that always

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,560
lists my spirit. I have some music posters. I have this Picasso poster that's melancholy

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,600
but beautiful nonetheless. But I also have something else, something of a different sort.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Hell, by Hieronymus Bosch. Now why do I keep this terrifying and disturbing picture around?

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Why do I look at it every day? Because it reminds me why I do what I do. It reminds

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,500
me what half the men and women around me really believe. It reminds me what they think will

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,840
happen to me, and the ones I love after we are dead. It reminds me what they think I

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,000
deserve. Sure, it's easy to dismiss Christianity as harmless, superstitional. Jesus, meek and

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,440
mild, just a little something to bring comfort to people and get them through the day. But

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,960
a closer examination of the beliefs of the believer and of scripture itself will reveal

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,120
that something very upsetting and awful is under all of this. Mainstream Christianity

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,040
tells us that those of us who do not believe face eternal punishment after death. Fiery

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,040
torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, perishing, death, condemnation, judgment, wrath, everlasting

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,120
destruction, raging fire, blackest darkness and burning sulfur, where we will be tormented

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,120
day and night, forever and ever. And this is what you believe I deserve. This is what

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,560
you believe I have earned by my refusal to believe as you believe. And you expect me

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
to respect this notion? This is a barbaric and ancient superstition. The world needs

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,040
to wake up and see it for what it is. This is not the 12th century anymore. Our species

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,720
has survived the 20th century. We know what hell on earth looks like. We have seen raging

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,440
fire. We have seen weeping and death. We have seen torment day and night, and yet you dare

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,640
to suggest that a loving God endorses this. After so many men and women have suffered

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,360
on earth, you dare to suggest that a loving God sanctions an eternal genocide of his nature.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
I still have time to save myself, you say. Well, what of the billions who are already

29
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,720
lost, who are already burning? Are you indifferent to their suffering? Do their cries for mercy

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,480
fall in different years? Is not an infinite punishment for a finite crime infinitely unjust?

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,320
And yet, this is what you announce to be the fate of myself and many of those I love and

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,680
many of those I hate. You worship and praise a God who judges me, who sentences me to eternal

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,520
torment, and yet I'm the one who's supposed to shop and tolerate your beliefs? I don't

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,720
think so. How dare you praise such a God? How can you even look me in the eye knowing

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,600
what you believe to be my fate? How dare you worship a God that would do that to me, to

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,160
anyone? Why do I even talk to you? I talk to you because I have no choice.
