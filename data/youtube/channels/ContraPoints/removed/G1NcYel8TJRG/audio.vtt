You know, every once in a while I'll meet a nice Christian, and on those occasions I'll

00:12.880 --> 00:19.640
often get a sort of a nasty feeling inside, a little pang of guilt or regret that I'm

00:19.640 --> 00:28.360
so hard on their religion, that I'm so aggressive and so critical of their beliefs.

00:28.360 --> 00:36.140
That feeling never lasts very long. I have something hanging on my wall, and whenever

00:36.140 --> 00:44.880
I look at it, that feeling of regret melts away.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.720
Let's take a look at some of the things on my wall. I have an Einstein poster that always

00:49.720 --> 00:55.560
lists my spirit. I have some music posters. I have this Picasso poster that's melancholy

00:55.560 --> 01:01.600
but beautiful nonetheless. But I also have something else, something of a different sort.

01:01.600 --> 01:07.600
Hell, by Hieronymus Bosch. Now why do I keep this terrifying and disturbing picture around?

01:07.600 --> 01:15.440
Why do I look at it every day? Because it reminds me why I do what I do. It reminds

01:15.440 --> 01:19.500
me what half the men and women around me really believe. It reminds me what they think will

01:19.500 --> 01:23.840
happen to me, and the ones I love after we are dead. It reminds me what they think I

01:23.840 --> 01:31.000
deserve. Sure, it's easy to dismiss Christianity as harmless, superstitional. Jesus, meek and

01:31.000 --> 01:35.440
mild, just a little something to bring comfort to people and get them through the day. But

01:35.440 --> 01:39.960
a closer examination of the beliefs of the believer and of scripture itself will reveal

01:39.960 --> 01:45.120
that something very upsetting and awful is under all of this. Mainstream Christianity

01:45.120 --> 01:50.040
tells us that those of us who do not believe face eternal punishment after death. Fiery

01:50.040 --> 01:57.040
torment, weeping and gnashing of teeth, perishing, death, condemnation, judgment, wrath, everlasting

01:57.040 --> 02:02.120
destruction, raging fire, blackest darkness and burning sulfur, where we will be tormented

02:02.120 --> 02:08.120
day and night, forever and ever. And this is what you believe I deserve. This is what

02:08.120 --> 02:12.560
you believe I have earned by my refusal to believe as you believe. And you expect me

02:12.560 --> 02:17.360
to respect this notion? This is a barbaric and ancient superstition. The world needs

02:17.360 --> 02:22.040
to wake up and see it for what it is. This is not the 12th century anymore. Our species

02:22.040 --> 02:27.720
has survived the 20th century. We know what hell on earth looks like. We have seen raging

02:27.720 --> 02:33.440
fire. We have seen weeping and death. We have seen torment day and night, and yet you dare

02:33.440 --> 02:37.640
to suggest that a loving God endorses this. After so many men and women have suffered

02:37.640 --> 02:43.360
on earth, you dare to suggest that a loving God sanctions an eternal genocide of his nature.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.200
I still have time to save myself, you say. Well, what of the billions who are already

02:47.200 --> 02:51.720
lost, who are already burning? Are you indifferent to their suffering? Do their cries for mercy

02:51.720 --> 02:58.480
fall in different years? Is not an infinite punishment for a finite crime infinitely unjust?

02:58.480 --> 03:02.320
And yet, this is what you announce to be the fate of myself and many of those I love and

03:02.320 --> 03:07.680
many of those I hate. You worship and praise a God who judges me, who sentences me to eternal

03:07.680 --> 03:11.520
torment, and yet I'm the one who's supposed to shop and tolerate your beliefs? I don't

03:11.520 --> 03:15.720
think so. How dare you praise such a God? How can you even look me in the eye knowing

03:15.720 --> 03:19.600
what you believe to be my fate? How dare you worship a God that would do that to me, to

03:19.600 --> 03:28.160
anyone? Why do I even talk to you? I talk to you because I have no choice.
