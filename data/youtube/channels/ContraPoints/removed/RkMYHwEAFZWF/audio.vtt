00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
Warning, the following program depicts exercises which, depending upon your physical condition,

00:06.520 --> 00:22.240
may be hazardous to your health.

00:22.240 --> 00:27.480
Tyle Einz, irony in hypocritical moralism as a mask for sadistic bullying.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.880
A lot of fat-shaming is simply bullying, and giving it a soft word like shaming basically

00:31.880 --> 00:36.940
just makes it easier for villains to shroud cruelty in a cloak of phony concern for health.

00:36.940 --> 00:42.160
For instance, prominent conservative intellectual Milo Yiannopoulos claims if you are obese,

00:42.160 --> 00:46.480
you should hate yourself, at least until you get better, because fatness is a health problem

00:46.480 --> 00:48.040
and shame works.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.820
This is from an article he wrote for Breitbart called Science Proves It, Fat-Shaming Works,

00:52.820 --> 00:57.180
which I recommend to anyone who hasn't yet fully appreciated the extent of this vacuous

00:57.180 --> 01:00.200
assclown's sneering disdain for what is true.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.120
If a fatty isn't shamed immediately, claims this goddamn hyena, it's likely that the

01:04.120 --> 01:07.620
Hampi's self-destructive behavior might spread to its friends.

01:07.620 --> 01:12.380
Oh, but it's not just cruelty, it's for their benefit, our benefit, and the good of the

01:12.380 --> 01:13.380
species.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.940
Wow, I guess Milo's just a humanitarian after all.

01:16.940 --> 01:22.360
Of course, this article is obviously, in some sense, a joke.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.440
It's trolling.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.180
Milo claims to present a scientific defense of fat-shaming, but in fact he cites only

01:29.180 --> 01:32.980
the Daily Mail and a few scientific studies that don't even come close to supporting

01:32.980 --> 01:33.980
his thesis.

01:33.980 --> 01:37.240
Now, if Milo were privately pressed on this point, you know, that his arguments are too

01:37.240 --> 01:41.620
bad to even need debunking and his conclusions are vile and insane, I can imagine him retreating

01:41.620 --> 01:45.860
ruche-like to the implausible defense that this is actually all just satire.

01:45.860 --> 01:47.200
But satire of what?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Of himself?

01:48.200 --> 01:51.580
Of people who get offended by the intentionally offensive things he says?

01:51.580 --> 01:56.400
The just trolling defense is commonly used online as a way for misogynist, white supremacist,

01:56.400 --> 01:59.160
and other indefensible ideas to evade criticism.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.160
See, if I criticize Milo earnestly, I now look like a fool for feeding the troll.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.880
But if I don't criticize him at all, I give his real message an easy pass.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.080
And there is a real message, isn't there?

02:10.080 --> 02:13.680
In this case, that people who don't strictly conform to an ideal body type deserve nothing

02:13.680 --> 02:15.360
but ridicule and scorn.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.600
Other defenses of fat-shaming seem to follow this same evasive pattern.

02:18.620 --> 02:23.320
First, you acknowledge that what you're saying of course sounds kind of cruel and heartless.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.860
And then you assert that your apparent cruelty is really just tough love with the health

02:27.860 --> 02:30.580
and well-being of the hideous lard planets at heart.

02:30.580 --> 02:33.760
But then of course the whole argument is peppered with abusive statements that give the lie

02:33.760 --> 02:35.620
to the tough love defense.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.740
Blair White's video on the subject follows this basic blueprint.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.560
She spends five minutes laughing at fatties.

02:40.560 --> 02:48.980
Then she fires off a couple of unresearched slapdash opinions about how important it is

02:48.980 --> 02:53.420
for public health that everyone is constantly reminded how bad and disgusting obesity is,

02:53.420 --> 02:55.020
and then she calls it a day.

02:55.020 --> 02:59.900
Well done Blair, 300,000 views, 194,000 subscribers.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.460
I'm not bitter at all, why would you think that?

03:02.460 --> 03:06.780
Of course, anyone with an ounce of perception can see that this so-called tough love and

03:06.780 --> 03:11.560
just stating the facts is obviously just an excuse to upset and humiliate people and

03:11.560 --> 03:13.040
get away with it.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.800
Fatt-shaming is motivated by disgust and disdain, not by compassion and concern.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.160
The people who are actually concerned about obesity generally don't jump at the first

03:20.160 --> 03:23.440
opportunity to treat another human being like absolute shit.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.320
Milo and Blair and Katie Hopkins seem to be asking the question, what would have to be

03:27.320 --> 03:30.180
true for my bullying behavior to be justified?

03:30.180 --> 03:34.600
And whatever the answer is, that must be true, because otherwise I'd be a bad person.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.260
And that's not an acceptable conclusion, so it must be the case that bullying fat people

03:38.260 --> 03:39.880
is actually good for society.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.700
Checkmate, swagellians.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.820
Whereas people who actually care about what is true and good ask real questions.

03:45.820 --> 03:48.600
Questions like, what causes obesity in the first place?

03:48.600 --> 03:52.660
What percentage of obese people have been obese or overweight since childhood or adolescence?

03:52.660 --> 03:56.060
How easy or difficult is it to lose a lot of weight and keep that weight off?

03:56.060 --> 03:59.280
What are the biological and environmental factors that contribute to obesity?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.660
How does an obsession with losing weight affect mental health?

04:01.660 --> 04:04.500
Is our collective obsession with weight loss really just about health?

04:04.500 --> 04:07.240
Or is it driving us into the realm of madness?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.840
Tell us, Socrates.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.740
Tell us!

04:24.560 --> 04:25.720
I'm healthy, goddammit!

04:25.720 --> 04:26.440
I'm healthy!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.800
Tiled Svi.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.020
Wherefore art thou fat?

04:32.020 --> 04:36.400
The pro-bullying camp likes to advocate, or pretend to advocate, the idea that a person's

04:36.400 --> 04:40.440
weight is primarily a matter of self-control and individual responsibility.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.200
But let's take a look at the phenomenon of obesity from an epidemiological standpoint.

04:44.200 --> 04:51.260
The prevalence of obesity in the US has risen from 13.4% in 1962 to 35.7% in 2010.

04:51.260 --> 04:54.960
What happened over the last few decades to cause the obesity rate to more than double?

04:54.960 --> 04:57.120
Did everyone suddenly lose all self-control?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.320
Is there some way this can be blamed on feminism?

04:59.380 --> 05:02.100
Well, this is really not how scientists think.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.660
Researchers have been studying the causes of obesity for decades, and they've identified

05:05.660 --> 05:10.080
a huge range of contributing factors, including the prevalence of high-calorie foods, industrial

05:10.080 --> 05:15.060
agriculture, long work hours, genetics and epigenetics, hormones, insulin resistance,

05:15.060 --> 05:18.220
obesogenic chemicals, and treatment of children with antibiotics.

05:18.220 --> 05:21.200
Basically, it's a clusterfuck of causes that no one fully understands.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.860
But it's a lot more complicated than calories in, calories out, and while it's true that

05:24.860 --> 05:27.940
individuals do have some control over their weight, there's a lot more going on here

05:27.940 --> 05:30.060
than just weakness of the will.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.920
Especially malicious or misinformed is the idea that obese people are just lazy overeaters

05:33.920 --> 05:35.540
with no self-control.

05:35.540 --> 05:42.240
Despite all the publicity given to inspirational weight loss journeys, it's actually extremely

05:42.240 --> 05:46.360
difficult for obese people to keep off weight, because the human body has evolved to keep

05:46.360 --> 05:50.520
weight on to prevent starvation, and it therefore develops adaptations that work to preserve

05:50.520 --> 05:51.720
its maximum weight.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.480
The authors of an article in The Lancet go so far as to suggest that obese people who

05:55.480 --> 05:59.960
have lost weight still have obesity and remission, and advised that the mere recommendation to

05:59.960 --> 06:03.960
avoid calorically dense foods might be no more effective for the typical patient seeking

06:03.960 --> 06:08.160
weight reduction than would be a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding

06:08.160 --> 06:09.160
profusely.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.060
And while there are of course some people who make the heroic effort to lose the weight

06:12.060 --> 06:16.260
and do manage to keep it off, the reality is that most obese people never will.

06:16.260 --> 06:21.120
So the proposal that socially reinforced self-loathing is the best solution to obesity is as stupid

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
as it is immoral.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.260
Ugh, why am I still arguing with these people?

06:24.380 --> 06:28.640
It's like citing scientific studies to an 8th grader who responds by calling you a faggot.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.680
God damn, it's just pathetic.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.960
Makes me want to fucking eat.

06:31.960 --> 06:40.520
4 Big Mac sandwiches with 2252 calories, 4028 mg of sodium, and 132 grams of fat including

06:40.520 --> 06:42.580
5.2 grams of trans fat.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.580
Aww yeah!

06:43.580 --> 06:46.760
That's metal as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.880
Alright chums, let's do this!

06:54.260 --> 07:22.260
Alright, that's it, that's all I got, it's uh, almost 3 Big Macs, that's my limit.

07:22.260 --> 07:31.500
YouTube, there's only one thing I do in times like these, and you're going to want to avert

07:31.500 --> 07:38.340
your eyes.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.220
Tile dry.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.540
Fat acceptance.

07:41.540 --> 07:45.900
According to the CDC, more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.640
Since it seems unlikely that 2 thirds of the population are going to simply hate themselves

07:49.640 --> 07:51.500
thin, we need to consider other options.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.340
It makes good sense to me for doctors and educators to emphasize healthy eating and

07:55.340 --> 07:56.420
exercise habits.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.040
If you eat well and exercise, that's really the most you can be expected to do, whatever

08:00.040 --> 08:01.040
your weight.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.820
But in my opinion, even this view of things sometimes gives a little too sharp a moralizing

08:04.820 --> 08:06.980
edge to the idea of health.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.180
I don't think it's inherently virtuous to be healthy.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.620
I mean, maybe you think it is if you took the glorious pill, or if you're a fucking

08:12.620 --> 08:16.020
Aristotelian or something, but I don't think that it's really any of my business to tell

08:16.020 --> 08:17.540
people that they should be healthy.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.820
I mean, what do I look like, your fucking doctor?

08:19.820 --> 08:22.020
I also think that self-loathing helps nothing.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.420
I don't really have an overeating problem, but I have been known to drink more than the

08:25.420 --> 08:30.980
medically advisable limits once or twice or six times a week, and I know that when someone

08:30.980 --> 08:35.500
tries to shame me for that, well, the experience doesn't generally leave me feeling less

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
like drinking.

08:36.500 --> 08:41.260
A famous study of formerly morbidly obese people who underwent gastric restrictive surgery

08:41.260 --> 08:45.180
found that these patients said they would prefer to be normal weight with a major handicap,

08:45.180 --> 08:48.700
blindness, or one leg amputated than to be morbidly obese again.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.540
Clearly, people really hate being fat as it is, and I know in these discussions a lot

08:52.540 --> 08:56.300
of equivocation goes on between overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, and I'm doing

08:56.300 --> 09:00.180
it too, but I think it's clear from the sheer size of the weight loss industry alone that

09:00.180 --> 09:04.100
people really hate being fat, and it doesn't help that the culturally ideal body is pretty

09:04.100 --> 09:08.100
unobtainable for most people, who won't look like this no matter how hard they try.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.600
If healthy habits are presented as a means to becoming skinny, rather than as valuable

09:11.600 --> 09:15.940
for their health benefits regardless of weight, many people may simply give up altogether.

09:15.940 --> 09:19.700
Given that most of the population is deemed overweight by medical and aesthetic standards,

09:19.700 --> 09:23.660
and given how difficult it is to reverse endemic obesity, for the sake of general happiness,

09:23.660 --> 09:27.420
I'd say the thing to do is tone down the shaming and disgust, and open ourselves up

09:27.420 --> 09:31.260
to the celebration of a diversity of body types, traumatic though it may be for the

09:31.260 --> 09:32.260
weight police.

09:32.260 --> 09:36.420
Part of that is going to involve a symbolic transformation of the meaning of fatness.

09:36.420 --> 09:40.120
What I mean by that is things would be better if instead of sanctimoniously associating

09:40.120 --> 09:45.500
fatness with the sins of gluttony and sloth, we viewed it as a kind of celebration of excess.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Bacchus.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
Falstaff.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.500
David Hume.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
Bon Vivance.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
And voluptuaries, all.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.500
Epicureans, what?

09:51.500 --> 09:55.380
I guess I should have some diversity.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.500
Ladies and gentlemen, Howl and Wolf.

09:58.500 --> 10:07.540
And it is a little harder to think of fat role models when it comes to women.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.900
Lindy West, one of the best writers on this subject, has a very funny passage where she

10:10.900 --> 10:15.420
describes the total lack of fat female role models available to her as a child, and concludes

10:15.420 --> 10:19.700
that the most positive of such role models was Baloo the Bear dressed as a comely gypsy

10:19.700 --> 10:20.700
wench.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.420
I think that's a problem, and one that people in media should work to address.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.580
Now I don't mean through censorship or some kind of sinister cultural engineering, I just

10:27.580 --> 10:30.980
mean it's good for artists to tell stories about lots of different kinds of people, maybe

10:30.980 --> 10:34.540
even stories about people who actually look like the people who live in America, and I

10:34.540 --> 10:38.260
know to some people that in itself looks like sinister cultural engineering, but you know

10:38.260 --> 10:39.260
what?

10:39.260 --> 10:40.260
Too fucking bad.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.260
You'll be okay.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.460
You can go on 4chan still and bitch about the fatties all you want, but the rest of

10:43.460 --> 10:45.260
us are moving on.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.540
Child fear.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.260
Lingering anxiety.

10:48.260 --> 10:51.260
There's one thing that's still bothering me, and that's that while I believe everything

10:51.260 --> 10:55.060
I've said so far in this video, and I genuinely do think other people's bodies are none of

10:55.060 --> 10:59.500
my goddamn business, when it comes to my own body, I admit that I want to be thin, and

10:59.500 --> 11:01.060
I care about being thin.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.060
A lot.

11:02.060 --> 11:05.700
I'm afraid of becoming fat, and this is for reasons of vanity, not health.

11:05.700 --> 11:09.300
And maybe when I get too old to be hot anyway, I'll go full degenerate and gain a bunch of

11:09.300 --> 11:10.300
weight.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.300
Absolute decadence.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.300
Fuck it, why not?

11:12.340 --> 11:16.540
In the meantime, I acknowledge that, emotionally, I'm just as caught up in thin worship as anyone,

11:16.540 --> 11:19.860
despite all of my critiques, and I don't know how to fix that.

11:19.860 --> 11:23.300
Maybe the only thing critique itself can do is allow you to sketch the bars of your own

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
prison.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.900
And if that's true, god help me.

11:26.900 --> 11:27.900
God help us all.

11:27.900 --> 11:44.540
If you liked this video, leave a comment, send some white hot love to my patreon, and

11:44.540 --> 11:47.380
raise those hips in two and three and thrust.

11:47.380 --> 11:52.860
I'd like to thank Heterodox, Vorone, Roman Olyashev, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett

11:52.860 --> 11:59.340
Daffy, Raymond Heinrich, Bottled Sky, NoNoNo, Kat Stass, Neil Tak, Stealer of Souls, and

11:59.340 --> 12:03.820
the other patrons whose generosity casts its gay resplendence over every hill and valley

12:03.820 --> 12:06.820
of the earth.

12:06.820 --> 12:17.180
Oh god, I'm not actually in shape at all, this is killing me.
