0	6520	Warning, the following program depicts exercises which, depending upon your physical condition,
6520	22240	may be hazardous to your health.
22240	27480	Tyle Einz, irony in hypocritical moralism as a mask for sadistic bullying.
27480	31880	A lot of fat-shaming is simply bullying, and giving it a soft word like shaming basically
31880	36940	just makes it easier for villains to shroud cruelty in a cloak of phony concern for health.
36940	42160	For instance, prominent conservative intellectual Milo Yiannopoulos claims if you are obese,
42160	46480	you should hate yourself, at least until you get better, because fatness is a health problem
46480	48040	and shame works.
48040	52820	This is from an article he wrote for Breitbart called Science Proves It, Fat-Shaming Works,
52820	57180	which I recommend to anyone who hasn't yet fully appreciated the extent of this vacuous
57180	60200	assclown's sneering disdain for what is true.
60200	64120	If a fatty isn't shamed immediately, claims this goddamn hyena, it's likely that the
64120	67620	Hampi's self-destructive behavior might spread to its friends.
67620	72380	Oh, but it's not just cruelty, it's for their benefit, our benefit, and the good of the
72380	73380	species.
73380	76940	Wow, I guess Milo's just a humanitarian after all.
76940	82360	Of course, this article is obviously, in some sense, a joke.
82360	85440	It's trolling.
85440	89180	Milo claims to present a scientific defense of fat-shaming, but in fact he cites only
89180	92980	the Daily Mail and a few scientific studies that don't even come close to supporting
92980	93980	his thesis.
93980	97240	Now, if Milo were privately pressed on this point, you know, that his arguments are too
97240	101620	bad to even need debunking and his conclusions are vile and insane, I can imagine him retreating
101620	105860	ruche-like to the implausible defense that this is actually all just satire.
105860	107200	But satire of what?
107200	108200	Of himself?
108200	111580	Of people who get offended by the intentionally offensive things he says?
111580	116400	The just trolling defense is commonly used online as a way for misogynist, white supremacist,
116400	119160	and other indefensible ideas to evade criticism.
119160	124160	See, if I criticize Milo earnestly, I now look like a fool for feeding the troll.
124160	127880	But if I don't criticize him at all, I give his real message an easy pass.
127880	130080	And there is a real message, isn't there?
130080	133680	In this case, that people who don't strictly conform to an ideal body type deserve nothing
133680	135360	but ridicule and scorn.
135360	138600	Other defenses of fat-shaming seem to follow this same evasive pattern.
138620	143320	First, you acknowledge that what you're saying of course sounds kind of cruel and heartless.
143320	147860	And then you assert that your apparent cruelty is really just tough love with the health
147860	150580	and well-being of the hideous lard planets at heart.
150580	153760	But then of course the whole argument is peppered with abusive statements that give the lie
153760	155620	to the tough love defense.
155620	158740	Blair White's video on the subject follows this basic blueprint.
158740	160560	She spends five minutes laughing at fatties.
160560	168980	Then she fires off a couple of unresearched slapdash opinions about how important it is
168980	173420	for public health that everyone is constantly reminded how bad and disgusting obesity is,
173420	175020	and then she calls it a day.
175020	179900	Well done Blair, 300,000 views, 194,000 subscribers.
179900	182460	I'm not bitter at all, why would you think that?
182460	186780	Of course, anyone with an ounce of perception can see that this so-called tough love and
186780	191560	just stating the facts is obviously just an excuse to upset and humiliate people and
191560	193040	get away with it.
193040	196800	Fatt-shaming is motivated by disgust and disdain, not by compassion and concern.
196800	200160	The people who are actually concerned about obesity generally don't jump at the first
200160	203440	opportunity to treat another human being like absolute shit.
203440	207320	Milo and Blair and Katie Hopkins seem to be asking the question, what would have to be
207320	210180	true for my bullying behavior to be justified?
210180	214600	And whatever the answer is, that must be true, because otherwise I'd be a bad person.
214600	218260	And that's not an acceptable conclusion, so it must be the case that bullying fat people
218260	219880	is actually good for society.
219880	221700	Checkmate, swagellians.
221700	225820	Whereas people who actually care about what is true and good ask real questions.
225820	228600	Questions like, what causes obesity in the first place?
228600	232660	What percentage of obese people have been obese or overweight since childhood or adolescence?
232660	236060	How easy or difficult is it to lose a lot of weight and keep that weight off?
236060	239280	What are the biological and environmental factors that contribute to obesity?
239280	241660	How does an obsession with losing weight affect mental health?
241660	244500	Is our collective obsession with weight loss really just about health?
244500	247240	Or is it driving us into the realm of madness?
247240	248840	Tell us, Socrates.
248840	249740	Tell us!
264560	265720	I'm healthy, goddammit!
265720	266440	I'm healthy!
267960	269800	Tiled Svi.
269800	272020	Wherefore art thou fat?
272020	276400	The pro-bullying camp likes to advocate, or pretend to advocate, the idea that a person's
276400	280440	weight is primarily a matter of self-control and individual responsibility.
280440	284200	But let's take a look at the phenomenon of obesity from an epidemiological standpoint.
284200	291260	The prevalence of obesity in the US has risen from 13.4% in 1962 to 35.7% in 2010.
291260	294960	What happened over the last few decades to cause the obesity rate to more than double?
294960	297120	Did everyone suddenly lose all self-control?
297120	299320	Is there some way this can be blamed on feminism?
299380	302100	Well, this is really not how scientists think.
302100	305660	Researchers have been studying the causes of obesity for decades, and they've identified
305660	310080	a huge range of contributing factors, including the prevalence of high-calorie foods, industrial
310080	315060	agriculture, long work hours, genetics and epigenetics, hormones, insulin resistance,
315060	318220	obesogenic chemicals, and treatment of children with antibiotics.
318220	321200	Basically, it's a clusterfuck of causes that no one fully understands.
321200	324860	But it's a lot more complicated than calories in, calories out, and while it's true that
324860	327940	individuals do have some control over their weight, there's a lot more going on here
327940	330060	than just weakness of the will.
330060	333920	Especially malicious or misinformed is the idea that obese people are just lazy overeaters
333920	335540	with no self-control.
335540	342240	Despite all the publicity given to inspirational weight loss journeys, it's actually extremely
342240	346360	difficult for obese people to keep off weight, because the human body has evolved to keep
346360	350520	weight on to prevent starvation, and it therefore develops adaptations that work to preserve
350520	351720	its maximum weight.
351720	355480	The authors of an article in The Lancet go so far as to suggest that obese people who
355480	359960	have lost weight still have obesity and remission, and advised that the mere recommendation to
359960	363960	avoid calorically dense foods might be no more effective for the typical patient seeking
363960	368160	weight reduction than would be a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding
368160	369160	profusely.
369160	372060	And while there are of course some people who make the heroic effort to lose the weight
372060	376260	and do manage to keep it off, the reality is that most obese people never will.
376260	381120	So the proposal that socially reinforced self-loathing is the best solution to obesity is as stupid
381120	382120	as it is immoral.
382120	384260	Ugh, why am I still arguing with these people?
384380	388640	It's like citing scientific studies to an 8th grader who responds by calling you a faggot.
388640	390680	God damn, it's just pathetic.
390680	391960	Makes me want to fucking eat.
391960	400520	4 Big Mac sandwiches with 2252 calories, 4028 mg of sodium, and 132 grams of fat including
400520	402580	5.2 grams of trans fat.
402580	403580	Aww yeah!
403580	406760	That's metal as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
406760	408880	Alright chums, let's do this!
414260	442260	Alright, that's it, that's all I got, it's uh, almost 3 Big Macs, that's my limit.
442260	451500	YouTube, there's only one thing I do in times like these, and you're going to want to avert
451500	458340	your eyes.
458340	460220	Tile dry.
460220	461540	Fat acceptance.
461540	465900	According to the CDC, more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.
465900	469640	Since it seems unlikely that 2 thirds of the population are going to simply hate themselves
469640	471500	thin, we need to consider other options.
471500	475340	It makes good sense to me for doctors and educators to emphasize healthy eating and
475340	476420	exercise habits.
476420	480040	If you eat well and exercise, that's really the most you can be expected to do, whatever
480040	481040	your weight.
481040	484820	But in my opinion, even this view of things sometimes gives a little too sharp a moralizing
484820	486980	edge to the idea of health.
486980	489180	I don't think it's inherently virtuous to be healthy.
489180	492620	I mean, maybe you think it is if you took the glorious pill, or if you're a fucking
492620	496020	Aristotelian or something, but I don't think that it's really any of my business to tell
496020	497540	people that they should be healthy.
497540	499820	I mean, what do I look like, your fucking doctor?
499820	502020	I also think that self-loathing helps nothing.
502020	505420	I don't really have an overeating problem, but I have been known to drink more than the
505420	510980	medically advisable limits once or twice or six times a week, and I know that when someone
510980	515500	tries to shame me for that, well, the experience doesn't generally leave me feeling less
515500	516500	like drinking.
516500	521260	A famous study of formerly morbidly obese people who underwent gastric restrictive surgery
521260	525180	found that these patients said they would prefer to be normal weight with a major handicap,
525180	528700	blindness, or one leg amputated than to be morbidly obese again.
528700	532540	Clearly, people really hate being fat as it is, and I know in these discussions a lot
532540	536300	of equivocation goes on between overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, and I'm doing
536300	540180	it too, but I think it's clear from the sheer size of the weight loss industry alone that
540180	544100	people really hate being fat, and it doesn't help that the culturally ideal body is pretty
544100	548100	unobtainable for most people, who won't look like this no matter how hard they try.
548100	551600	If healthy habits are presented as a means to becoming skinny, rather than as valuable
551600	555940	for their health benefits regardless of weight, many people may simply give up altogether.
555940	559700	Given that most of the population is deemed overweight by medical and aesthetic standards,
559700	563660	and given how difficult it is to reverse endemic obesity, for the sake of general happiness,
563660	567420	I'd say the thing to do is tone down the shaming and disgust, and open ourselves up
567420	571260	to the celebration of a diversity of body types, traumatic though it may be for the
571260	572260	weight police.
572260	576420	Part of that is going to involve a symbolic transformation of the meaning of fatness.
576420	580120	What I mean by that is things would be better if instead of sanctimoniously associating
580120	585500	fatness with the sins of gluttony and sloth, we viewed it as a kind of celebration of excess.
585500	586500	Bacchus.
586500	587500	Falstaff.
587500	588500	David Hume.
588500	589500	Bon Vivance.
589500	590500	And voluptuaries, all.
590500	591500	Epicureans, what?
591500	595380	I guess I should have some diversity.
595380	598500	Ladies and gentlemen, Howl and Wolf.
598500	607540	And it is a little harder to think of fat role models when it comes to women.
607540	610900	Lindy West, one of the best writers on this subject, has a very funny passage where she
610900	615420	describes the total lack of fat female role models available to her as a child, and concludes
615420	619700	that the most positive of such role models was Baloo the Bear dressed as a comely gypsy
619700	620700	wench.
620700	623420	I think that's a problem, and one that people in media should work to address.
623420	627580	Now I don't mean through censorship or some kind of sinister cultural engineering, I just
627580	630980	mean it's good for artists to tell stories about lots of different kinds of people, maybe
630980	634540	even stories about people who actually look like the people who live in America, and I
634540	638260	know to some people that in itself looks like sinister cultural engineering, but you know
638260	639260	what?
639260	640260	Too fucking bad.
640260	641260	You'll be okay.
641260	643460	You can go on 4chan still and bitch about the fatties all you want, but the rest of
643460	645260	us are moving on.
645260	646540	Child fear.
646540	648260	Lingering anxiety.
648260	651260	There's one thing that's still bothering me, and that's that while I believe everything
651260	655060	I've said so far in this video, and I genuinely do think other people's bodies are none of
655060	659500	my goddamn business, when it comes to my own body, I admit that I want to be thin, and
659500	661060	I care about being thin.
661060	662060	A lot.
662060	665700	I'm afraid of becoming fat, and this is for reasons of vanity, not health.
665700	669300	And maybe when I get too old to be hot anyway, I'll go full degenerate and gain a bunch of
669300	670300	weight.
670300	671300	Absolute decadence.
671300	672300	Fuck it, why not?
672340	676540	In the meantime, I acknowledge that, emotionally, I'm just as caught up in thin worship as anyone,
676540	679860	despite all of my critiques, and I don't know how to fix that.
679860	683300	Maybe the only thing critique itself can do is allow you to sketch the bars of your own
683300	684300	prison.
684300	686900	And if that's true, god help me.
686900	687900	God help us all.
687900	704540	If you liked this video, leave a comment, send some white hot love to my patreon, and
704540	707380	raise those hips in two and three and thrust.
707380	712860	I'd like to thank Heterodox, Vorone, Roman Olyashev, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett
712860	719340	Daffy, Raymond Heinrich, Bottled Sky, NoNoNo, Kat Stass, Neil Tak, Stealer of Souls, and
719340	723820	the other patrons whose generosity casts its gay resplendence over every hill and valley
723820	726820	of the earth.
726820	737180	Oh god, I'm not actually in shape at all, this is killing me.
