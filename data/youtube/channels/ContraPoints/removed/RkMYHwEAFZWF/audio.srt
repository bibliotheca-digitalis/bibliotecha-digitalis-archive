1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Warning, the following program depicts exercises which, depending upon your physical condition,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:22,240
may be hazardous to your health.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,480
Tyle Einz, irony in hypocritical moralism as a mask for sadistic bullying.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,880
A lot of fat-shaming is simply bullying, and giving it a soft word like shaming basically

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,940
just makes it easier for villains to shroud cruelty in a cloak of phony concern for health.

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,160
For instance, prominent conservative intellectual Milo Yiannopoulos claims if you are obese,

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
you should hate yourself, at least until you get better, because fatness is a health problem

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,040
and shame works.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,820
This is from an article he wrote for Breitbart called Science Proves It, Fat-Shaming Works,

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,180
which I recommend to anyone who hasn't yet fully appreciated the extent of this vacuous

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,200
assclown's sneering disdain for what is true.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,120
If a fatty isn't shamed immediately, claims this goddamn hyena, it's likely that the

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,620
Hampi's self-destructive behavior might spread to its friends.

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,380
Oh, but it's not just cruelty, it's for their benefit, our benefit, and the good of the

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,380
species.

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,940
Wow, I guess Milo's just a humanitarian after all.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,360
Of course, this article is obviously, in some sense, a joke.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,440
It's trolling.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,180
Milo claims to present a scientific defense of fat-shaming, but in fact he cites only

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,980
the Daily Mail and a few scientific studies that don't even come close to supporting

21
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,980
his thesis.

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,240
Now, if Milo were privately pressed on this point, you know, that his arguments are too

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,620
bad to even need debunking and his conclusions are vile and insane, I can imagine him retreating

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,860
ruche-like to the implausible defense that this is actually all just satire.

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,200
But satire of what?

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Of himself?

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,580
Of people who get offended by the intentionally offensive things he says?

28
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,400
The just trolling defense is commonly used online as a way for misogynist, white supremacist,

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
and other indefensible ideas to evade criticism.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
See, if I criticize Milo earnestly, I now look like a fool for feeding the troll.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,880
But if I don't criticize him at all, I give his real message an easy pass.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,080
And there is a real message, isn't there?

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
In this case, that people who don't strictly conform to an ideal body type deserve nothing

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
but ridicule and scorn.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,600
Other defenses of fat-shaming seem to follow this same evasive pattern.

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,320
First, you acknowledge that what you're saying of course sounds kind of cruel and heartless.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,860
And then you assert that your apparent cruelty is really just tough love with the health

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,580
and well-being of the hideous lard planets at heart.

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,760
But then of course the whole argument is peppered with abusive statements that give the lie

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,620
to the tough love defense.

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,740
Blair White's video on the subject follows this basic blueprint.

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,560
She spends five minutes laughing at fatties.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,980
Then she fires off a couple of unresearched slapdash opinions about how important it is

44
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,420
for public health that everyone is constantly reminded how bad and disgusting obesity is,

45
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,020
and then she calls it a day.

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,900
Well done Blair, 300,000 views, 194,000 subscribers.

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,460
I'm not bitter at all, why would you think that?

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,780
Of course, anyone with an ounce of perception can see that this so-called tough love and

49
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,560
just stating the facts is obviously just an excuse to upset and humiliate people and

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,040
get away with it.

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,800
Fatt-shaming is motivated by disgust and disdain, not by compassion and concern.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,160
The people who are actually concerned about obesity generally don't jump at the first

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,440
opportunity to treat another human being like absolute shit.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,320
Milo and Blair and Katie Hopkins seem to be asking the question, what would have to be

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,180
true for my bullying behavior to be justified?

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,600
And whatever the answer is, that must be true, because otherwise I'd be a bad person.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,260
And that's not an acceptable conclusion, so it must be the case that bullying fat people

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,880
is actually good for society.

59
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,700
Checkmate, swagellians.

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,820
Whereas people who actually care about what is true and good ask real questions.

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,600
Questions like, what causes obesity in the first place?

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,660
What percentage of obese people have been obese or overweight since childhood or adolescence?

63
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,060
How easy or difficult is it to lose a lot of weight and keep that weight off?

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,280
What are the biological and environmental factors that contribute to obesity?

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,660
How does an obsession with losing weight affect mental health?

66
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,500
Is our collective obsession with weight loss really just about health?

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,240
Or is it driving us into the realm of madness?

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,840
Tell us, Socrates.

69
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,740
Tell us!

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm healthy, goddammit!

71
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,440
I'm healthy!

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,800
Tiled Svi.

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,020
Wherefore art thou fat?

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,400
The pro-bullying camp likes to advocate, or pretend to advocate, the idea that a person's

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,440
weight is primarily a matter of self-control and individual responsibility.

76
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,200
But let's take a look at the phenomenon of obesity from an epidemiological standpoint.

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,260
The prevalence of obesity in the US has risen from 13.4% in 1962 to 35.7% in 2010.

78
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,960
What happened over the last few decades to cause the obesity rate to more than double?

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
Did everyone suddenly lose all self-control?

80
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,320
Is there some way this can be blamed on feminism?

81
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,100
Well, this is really not how scientists think.

82
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,660
Researchers have been studying the causes of obesity for decades, and they've identified

83
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,080
a huge range of contributing factors, including the prevalence of high-calorie foods, industrial

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,060
agriculture, long work hours, genetics and epigenetics, hormones, insulin resistance,

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,220
obesogenic chemicals, and treatment of children with antibiotics.

86
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,200
Basically, it's a clusterfuck of causes that no one fully understands.

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,860
But it's a lot more complicated than calories in, calories out, and while it's true that

88
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,940
individuals do have some control over their weight, there's a lot more going on here

89
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,060
than just weakness of the will.

90
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,920
Especially malicious or misinformed is the idea that obese people are just lazy overeaters

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,540
with no self-control.

92
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,240
Despite all the publicity given to inspirational weight loss journeys, it's actually extremely

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,360
difficult for obese people to keep off weight, because the human body has evolved to keep

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,520
weight on to prevent starvation, and it therefore develops adaptations that work to preserve

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,720
its maximum weight.

96
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,480
The authors of an article in The Lancet go so far as to suggest that obese people who

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,960
have lost weight still have obesity and remission, and advised that the mere recommendation to

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
avoid calorically dense foods might be no more effective for the typical patient seeking

99
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,160
weight reduction than would be a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
profusely.

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,060
And while there are of course some people who make the heroic effort to lose the weight

102
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,260
and do manage to keep it off, the reality is that most obese people never will.

103
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,120
So the proposal that socially reinforced self-loathing is the best solution to obesity is as stupid

104
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
as it is immoral.

105
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,260
Ugh, why am I still arguing with these people?

106
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,640
It's like citing scientific studies to an 8th grader who responds by calling you a faggot.

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,680
God damn, it's just pathetic.

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,960
Makes me want to fucking eat.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:40,520
4 Big Mac sandwiches with 2252 calories, 4028 mg of sodium, and 132 grams of fat including

110
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,580
5.2 grams of trans fat.

111
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
Aww yeah!

112
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,760
That's metal as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,880
Alright chums, let's do this!

114
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Alright, that's it, that's all I got, it's uh, almost 3 Big Macs, that's my limit.

115
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:31,500
YouTube, there's only one thing I do in times like these, and you're going to want to avert

116
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,340
your eyes.

117
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,220
Tile dry.

118
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,540
Fat acceptance.

119
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,900
According to the CDC, more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.

120
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,640
Since it seems unlikely that 2 thirds of the population are going to simply hate themselves

121
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,500
thin, we need to consider other options.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,340
It makes good sense to me for doctors and educators to emphasize healthy eating and

123
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,420
exercise habits.

124
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,040
If you eat well and exercise, that's really the most you can be expected to do, whatever

125
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
your weight.

126
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,820
But in my opinion, even this view of things sometimes gives a little too sharp a moralizing

127
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,980
edge to the idea of health.

128
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,180
I don't think it's inherently virtuous to be healthy.

129
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,620
I mean, maybe you think it is if you took the glorious pill, or if you're a fucking

130
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,020
Aristotelian or something, but I don't think that it's really any of my business to tell

131
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,540
people that they should be healthy.

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,820
I mean, what do I look like, your fucking doctor?

133
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,020
I also think that self-loathing helps nothing.

134
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,420
I don't really have an overeating problem, but I have been known to drink more than the

135
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,980
medically advisable limits once or twice or six times a week, and I know that when someone

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,500
tries to shame me for that, well, the experience doesn't generally leave me feeling less

137
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
like drinking.

138
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,260
A famous study of formerly morbidly obese people who underwent gastric restrictive surgery

139
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,180
found that these patients said they would prefer to be normal weight with a major handicap,

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,700
blindness, or one leg amputated than to be morbidly obese again.

141
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,540
Clearly, people really hate being fat as it is, and I know in these discussions a lot

142
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,300
of equivocation goes on between overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, and I'm doing

143
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,180
it too, but I think it's clear from the sheer size of the weight loss industry alone that

144
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,100
people really hate being fat, and it doesn't help that the culturally ideal body is pretty

145
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,100
unobtainable for most people, who won't look like this no matter how hard they try.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,600
If healthy habits are presented as a means to becoming skinny, rather than as valuable

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,940
for their health benefits regardless of weight, many people may simply give up altogether.

148
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,700
Given that most of the population is deemed overweight by medical and aesthetic standards,

149
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,660
and given how difficult it is to reverse endemic obesity, for the sake of general happiness,

150
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,420
I'd say the thing to do is tone down the shaming and disgust, and open ourselves up

151
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,260
to the celebration of a diversity of body types, traumatic though it may be for the

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
weight police.

153
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,420
Part of that is going to involve a symbolic transformation of the meaning of fatness.

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,120
What I mean by that is things would be better if instead of sanctimoniously associating

155
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,500
fatness with the sins of gluttony and sloth, we viewed it as a kind of celebration of excess.

156
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Bacchus.

157
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Falstaff.

158
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
David Hume.

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Bon Vivance.

160
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
And voluptuaries, all.

161
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Epicureans, what?

162
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,380
I guess I should have some diversity.

163
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,500
Ladies and gentlemen, Howl and Wolf.

164
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:07,540
And it is a little harder to think of fat role models when it comes to women.

165
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,900
Lindy West, one of the best writers on this subject, has a very funny passage where she

166
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,420
describes the total lack of fat female role models available to her as a child, and concludes

167
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,700
that the most positive of such role models was Baloo the Bear dressed as a comely gypsy

168
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
wench.

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,420
I think that's a problem, and one that people in media should work to address.

170
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,580
Now I don't mean through censorship or some kind of sinister cultural engineering, I just

171
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,980
mean it's good for artists to tell stories about lots of different kinds of people, maybe

172
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,540
even stories about people who actually look like the people who live in America, and I

173
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,260
know to some people that in itself looks like sinister cultural engineering, but you know

174
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
what?

175
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Too fucking bad.

176
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
You'll be okay.

177
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,460
You can go on 4chan still and bitch about the fatties all you want, but the rest of

178
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,260
us are moving on.

179
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,540
Child fear.

180
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,260
Lingering anxiety.

181
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,260
There's one thing that's still bothering me, and that's that while I believe everything

182
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,060
I've said so far in this video, and I genuinely do think other people's bodies are none of

183
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,500
my goddamn business, when it comes to my own body, I admit that I want to be thin, and

184
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,060
I care about being thin.

185
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
A lot.

186
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm afraid of becoming fat, and this is for reasons of vanity, not health.

187
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,300
And maybe when I get too old to be hot anyway, I'll go full degenerate and gain a bunch of

188
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
weight.

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Absolute decadence.

190
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Fuck it, why not?

191
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,540
In the meantime, I acknowledge that, emotionally, I'm just as caught up in thin worship as anyone,

192
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,860
despite all of my critiques, and I don't know how to fix that.

193
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,300
Maybe the only thing critique itself can do is allow you to sketch the bars of your own

194
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
prison.

195
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,900
And if that's true, god help me.

196
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
God help us all.

197
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:44,540
If you liked this video, leave a comment, send some white hot love to my patreon, and

198
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,380
raise those hips in two and three and thrust.

199
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,860
I'd like to thank Heterodox, Vorone, Roman Olyashev, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett

200
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:59,340
Daffy, Raymond Heinrich, Bottled Sky, NoNoNo, Kat Stass, Neil Tak, Stealer of Souls, and

201
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,820
the other patrons whose generosity casts its gay resplendence over every hill and valley

202
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
of the earth.

203
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:17,180
Oh god, I'm not actually in shape at all, this is killing me.
