1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
So YouTube's all in an uproar, because apparently there are too many genders.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,600
There are simply too many notes, Hamletzart.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,480
You see, when we were kids, boys played with tiny skateboards and girls played with urine.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,640
Potty feels like magic and it flushes out loud.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,760
The cosmic order was in balance, but now there's demigweers and trigenders and everyone wants

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
to kill themselves.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
But you know what?

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,040
Maybe hold off on the bleach for a second, Barry Hamlet.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,520
I say we give this thing a shot.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,920
But if we're gonna do that, we're gonna need to get into the spirit of the thing.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,400
So I think we're at a point where most civilized people accept homosexuality, and we seem to

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,360
even be making progress in the transgender issue, but non-binary genders are where the

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
line has been drawn.

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,280
Now, I don't identify as non-binary myself.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,400
In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Blue Man Muddy Waters pronounces the word

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
man.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Say it again.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,480
If you mispronounce it, I will be triggered.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,320
The point is I can't claim to speak for people who are non-binary, but what I can do is look

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
at arguments against non-binary identities and see if they have any merit.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,880
I say arguments against because I don't think non-binary people need to provide any arguments

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,200
in support of their own existence, because, unlike most of you, I am a real American,

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,740
which means that I believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called freedom.

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Argument one.

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,440
It's new and different and I don't like it.

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,160
The vast majority of people I see objecting to non-binary identities are people who are

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
basically just repulsed by something that's new and different and ridiculous to them.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,760
I identify as an attack helicopter.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,680
It's funny because you could never use a helicopter in combat.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,120
It should, but doesn't go without saying, that finding something weird and distasteful

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,400
does not in itself amount to an argument against it.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
I find it especially hard to sympathize with this view, since I have a personality type

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
that just kind of goes along with things, almost to a pathological extent.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Like, normal human beings are repulsed by things like incest and cannibalism, but I

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,960
kind of just don't have any emotions at all about those things.

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,160
And if someone tells me they alternate between three different gender identities, my initial

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,520
response is to say, really, that's interesting, tell me more.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,440
You know, I'm not repulsed, if anything, I'm attracted.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,520
If you think I'm comparing non-binary identities to cannibalism, here's the address to complain

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
to.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Argument two.

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,440
This is just made up because there's no science to support it.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,640
It's very interesting for me as a transsexual to see so many people running around claiming

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,160
all these crazy gender identities, when in reality, being transgender is an actual medical

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
diagnosis.

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,080
It means you've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is basically an extreme discontent

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
with one's own gender.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,960
So Blair's argument is that being transsexual is a medical diagnosis, whereas being non-binary

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,280
isn't, and therefore the former is a real phenomenon, whereas the latter is just make-believe.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,720
But for one thing, this is just an appeal to the authority of current medical practice.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
Five seconds ago, homosexuality was an actual medical diagnosis.

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,960
Monarchs make shit up as they go just as much as anyone, and they invent new words

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
to describe new conditions all the time.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,840
For another thing, non-binary gender isn't primarily a medical issue in the first place.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,080
Keep in mind that there's multiple dimensions to gender.

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,960
There's biological sex, male, female, intersex.

57
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,480
There's social roles, including things like mannerisms, style, dress, what kinds of work

58
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
and relationships are open to you.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,480
And then there's identity, which is your inner sense of what gender you are.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,400
And gender identity is what's in question here, so I really don't see why we need a

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,440
biological basis for validation.

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,320
You know, there's probably no gay gene, but there's definitely gay people, and we

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
didn't need brain scans to figure that out.

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,480
For another thing, there isn't very much in the way of scientific research on non-binary

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
genders yet.

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,520
We can't have scientific terms for things until scientists decide to study them.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Argument three.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,060
I don't feel like a gender, therefore no one else does either.

69
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,680
So to me, gender identity is kind of a confusing topic, since I personally don't have any

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,200
strong feelings of identifying with a gender at all.

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,160
I look inside myself and I ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,560
And the answer is that I feel like shit.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I mean, it's just hollow in here.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,280
To me, gender is all costumes, it's all charade, I choose to perform masculinity because that's

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,640
what I've been conditioned to do and it's just easiest.

76
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,720
But I feel irony toward gender roles and a kind of distance from my body.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,800
If I woke up tomorrow with tits and a vagina, I think I could probably roll with it.

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,680
You know, I get to wear better clothes.

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,080
But the only time I really feel like a woman is when I listen to Lionel Richie.

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes, you once, you twice, three times a lady.

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Oh yeah.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
That's the stuff.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,120
And the only times I feel like a man are when I listen to Muddy Waters and when I'm having

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
sex with a woman, which feels very natural.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
You could try it sometime.

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,000
You know, God smiles down, the angels trumpets sound, the maiden is laid bare, the intrepid

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
knight bounces.

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Oh, for fuck's sake!

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
What do you want?

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh, Jesus.

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Dark Mother, what is it now?

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,040
You dare make a video about feminism and not mention me!

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
This video isn't even about feminism!

94
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
It definitely isn't about video games.

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,080
But every video must be about me, because I'm the most important woman in the world!

96
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
No.

97
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
You know what?

98
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Fuck that.

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
I'm not doing this anymore.

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,080
SILENCE!

101
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Alright.

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Suck your goddamn c**t.

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Man, I'm tired of this shit.

104
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Argument 4.

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080
I refuse to call people by non-binary pronouns because it's not grammatical English.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,680
What do you people think language is, anyway?

107
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,720
You do realize it's just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,440
According to Wittgenstein, yeah I'm pulling this card, the meaning of words is determined

109
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,000
merely by the way they're used.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,240
So if we start using words in a new way, the new use determines the new meaning, and grammars

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,760
can be created or destroyed to suit our purposes.

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,360
You know, language is a human tool, not a dictate of the gods.

113
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,640
Wittgenstein also compared language to an ancient city, since language is always built

114
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,320
around the ruins of its own past.

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,640
This is also why I think the non-binary pronoun they is more likely to catch on than new inventions

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,640
like Z in here, because it's just a more natural way for the language to evolve.

117
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,360
But you know, Wittgenstein was also another one of these boring, unfunny, self-loathing

118
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,160
gay Jews, so, you know, what is with these guys?

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Argument 5.

120
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,640
Non-binary people are just special snowflake trans-crenders.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,680
Well, there's no doubt that non-binary genders are having a bit of a moment right now.

122
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,920
And you could ask, will all of these neologisms stick, you know, words like cloudgender and

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,320
greygender and astrogender, and the answer is that probably no, most of them won't.

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
But some of them probably will.

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,560
And while this gender inventiveness has probably gotten a little bit out of hand, I'm sure

126
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,880
it's always been the case that there are people who don't really fit into either gender,

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,760
and it's probably always going to be the case, and surely a society that makes room

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,120
for those people is more humane than one that doesn't.

129
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,240
And while the current wave of gender inventors will probably make some mistakes along the

130
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,000
way, I for one admire their experimentation.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
For one thing, they've paved the way for the rest of us normies to become a little

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,180
more fluid ourselves.

133
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
And why not?

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
It's fun.

135
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,500
So if we allow non-binary genders, then soon people's genders will be pineapple and mayonnaise.

136
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Good.

137
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Let's have pineapple and mayonnaise genders.

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,620
And this is where I'd like to see the radical feminists get on board.

139
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,600
I mean, patriarchy cannot possibly exist in a society where a significant number of people

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,220
are mayonnaise gender.

141
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,080
How am I supposed to explain to my child?

142
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Kill your shitty child.

143
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Then you won't have to explain anything.

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,020
Seriously, though, I think kids should be confused by gender, because it doesn't make

145
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
any goddamn sense.

146
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,140
In traditional agrarian societies, it made sense to divide people up by sex and assign

147
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,260
them different roles.

148
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,100
All there was to do in life was farm and reproduce, so men used their school biceps to plow the

149
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,380
mule and women bled on the birthing bed, and it was a pretty good system.

150
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,140
But in a capitalist, individualistic society, it doesn't really make sense to assign people

151
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,860
rigid roles based on what reproductive organs they have.

152
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,780
We know from history and anthropology that gender is pretty variable.

153
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,440
So I say, let's reinvent it to suit our purposes.

154
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,120
We should be celebrating, not mocking, the gender deviance of our own time.

155
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,960
After all, they're paving the way for the future, when our great-grandchildren will

156
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,780
plug their brains directly into the simulation to avoid the climate change-induced nightmare

157
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,420
that is what's left of the physical and biological realm.

158
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,660
There will be no more men and women in this world, only quad-gender wolfkin shamans endlessly

159
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,660
pollulating over the sunny plains of Azeroth.

160
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,380
And that, frankly, is a paradise I'm looking forward to.

161
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,900
If you liked this video, consider sending me a dollar or two on Patreon.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,540
If you're broke, or if you don't like me that much, understandably, well, you can leave

163
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
a comment.

164
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Tell me you love me.

165
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
The greatest love of all is happening to me.

166
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,540
The greatest love of all is inside me.

167
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:59,420
Patron Nick Wolf asks, who is the better hair, The Amazing Atheist or Thunderf00t?

168
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,980
Well, they both have real potential.

169
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,140
Thunderf00t has a lot of volume, but his hair is just extremely frizzy, probably because

170
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
it's dry.

171
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,620
Some deep conditioning and less frequent shampooing would fix this.

172
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,780
The Amazing Atheist has straight hair similar to mine, which is easier to manage, but again

173
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,540
it looks dry and wiry, probably due to inadequate conditioning.

174
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,260
I'm gonna have to go with Thunderf00t on this one, though, since if he'd just take better

175
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,460
care of it, his hair could really attain that early 18th century look, which I know isn't

176
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,260
everyone's jam, but it's certainly what I'm into.

177
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
Oh, and one more thing.

178
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,100
If you want to give me money but don't like recurring donations, I now have a PayPal link

179
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,580
in the description, so yay!

180
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
I love you.
