0	3840	So YouTube's all in an uproar, because apparently there are too many genders.
3840	6600	There are simply too many notes, Hamletzart.
6600	10480	You see, when we were kids, boys played with tiny skateboards and girls played with urine.
10480	14640	Potty feels like magic and it flushes out loud.
14640	18760	The cosmic order was in balance, but now there's demigweers and trigenders and everyone wants
18760	19760	to kill themselves.
19760	20760	But you know what?
20760	23040	Maybe hold off on the bleach for a second, Barry Hamlet.
23040	24520	I say we give this thing a shot.
24520	27920	But if we're gonna do that, we're gonna need to get into the spirit of the thing.
60000	69400	So I think we're at a point where most civilized people accept homosexuality, and we seem to
69400	73360	even be making progress in the transgender issue, but non-binary genders are where the
73360	74360	line has been drawn.
74360	76280	Now, I don't identify as non-binary myself.
76280	80400	In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Blue Man Muddy Waters pronounces the word
80400	81400	man.
81400	82400	Say it again.
82400	88480	If you mispronounce it, I will be triggered.
88480	92320	The point is I can't claim to speak for people who are non-binary, but what I can do is look
92320	95920	at arguments against non-binary identities and see if they have any merit.
95920	99880	I say arguments against because I don't think non-binary people need to provide any arguments
99880	104200	in support of their own existence, because, unlike most of you, I am a real American,
104200	110740	which means that I believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called freedom.
110740	111740	Argument one.
111740	113440	It's new and different and I don't like it.
113440	117160	The vast majority of people I see objecting to non-binary identities are people who are
117200	121280	basically just repulsed by something that's new and different and ridiculous to them.
121280	124760	I identify as an attack helicopter.
124760	132680	It's funny because you could never use a helicopter in combat.
132680	136120	It should, but doesn't go without saying, that finding something weird and distasteful
136120	138400	does not in itself amount to an argument against it.
138400	142080	I find it especially hard to sympathize with this view, since I have a personality type
142080	146040	that just kind of goes along with things, almost to a pathological extent.
146040	149840	Like, normal human beings are repulsed by things like incest and cannibalism, but I
149840	152960	kind of just don't have any emotions at all about those things.
152960	156160	And if someone tells me they alternate between three different gender identities, my initial
156160	160520	response is to say, really, that's interesting, tell me more.
160520	163440	You know, I'm not repulsed, if anything, I'm attracted.
163440	167520	If you think I'm comparing non-binary identities to cannibalism, here's the address to complain
167520	168520	to.
168520	169520	Argument two.
169520	171440	This is just made up because there's no science to support it.
171440	175640	It's very interesting for me as a transsexual to see so many people running around claiming
175720	180160	all these crazy gender identities, when in reality, being transgender is an actual medical
180160	181160	diagnosis.
181160	185080	It means you've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is basically an extreme discontent
185080	186080	with one's own gender.
186080	190960	So Blair's argument is that being transsexual is a medical diagnosis, whereas being non-binary
190960	195280	isn't, and therefore the former is a real phenomenon, whereas the latter is just make-believe.
195280	198720	But for one thing, this is just an appeal to the authority of current medical practice.
198720	203040	Five seconds ago, homosexuality was an actual medical diagnosis.
203040	205960	Monarchs make shit up as they go just as much as anyone, and they invent new words
205960	207960	to describe new conditions all the time.
207960	211840	For another thing, non-binary gender isn't primarily a medical issue in the first place.
211840	214080	Keep in mind that there's multiple dimensions to gender.
214080	216960	There's biological sex, male, female, intersex.
216960	221480	There's social roles, including things like mannerisms, style, dress, what kinds of work
221480	223240	and relationships are open to you.
223240	226480	And then there's identity, which is your inner sense of what gender you are.
226480	229400	And gender identity is what's in question here, so I really don't see why we need a
229400	231440	biological basis for validation.
231440	234320	You know, there's probably no gay gene, but there's definitely gay people, and we
234320	236200	didn't need brain scans to figure that out.
236200	239480	For another thing, there isn't very much in the way of scientific research on non-binary
239480	240480	genders yet.
240480	244520	We can't have scientific terms for things until scientists decide to study them.
244520	245520	Argument three.
245520	248060	I don't feel like a gender, therefore no one else does either.
248060	251680	So to me, gender identity is kind of a confusing topic, since I personally don't have any
251680	254200	strong feelings of identifying with a gender at all.
254200	257160	I look inside myself and I ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?
257160	259560	And the answer is that I feel like shit.
259720	261720	I mean, it's just hollow in here.
261720	266280	To me, gender is all costumes, it's all charade, I choose to perform masculinity because that's
266280	268640	what I've been conditioned to do and it's just easiest.
268640	271720	But I feel irony toward gender roles and a kind of distance from my body.
271720	275800	If I woke up tomorrow with tits and a vagina, I think I could probably roll with it.
275800	277680	You know, I get to wear better clothes.
277680	281080	But the only time I really feel like a woman is when I listen to Lionel Richie.
281080	290600	Yes, you once, you twice, three times a lady.
290600	291600	Oh yeah.
291600	292600	That's the stuff.
292600	297120	And the only times I feel like a man are when I listen to Muddy Waters and when I'm having
297120	299360	sex with a woman, which feels very natural.
299360	300360	You could try it sometime.
300360	306000	You know, God smiles down, the angels trumpets sound, the maiden is laid bare, the intrepid
306000	307000	knight bounces.
307040	309040	Oh, for fuck's sake!
309040	311040	What do you want?
315040	317040	Oh, Jesus.
323040	325040	Dark Mother, what is it now?
325040	329040	You dare make a video about feminism and not mention me!
329040	331040	This video isn't even about feminism!
331040	333040	It definitely isn't about video games.
333080	337080	But every video must be about me, because I'm the most important woman in the world!
337080	338080	No.
338080	339080	You know what?
339080	340080	Fuck that.
340080	341080	I'm not doing this anymore.
341080	345080	SILENCE!
345080	346080	Alright.
346080	348080	Suck your goddamn c**t.
351080	354080	Man, I'm tired of this shit.
354080	355080	Argument 4.
355080	358080	I refuse to call people by non-binary pronouns because it's not grammatical English.
358080	360680	What do you people think language is, anyway?
360720	363720	You do realize it's just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth.
363720	367440	According to Wittgenstein, yeah I'm pulling this card, the meaning of words is determined
367440	369000	merely by the way they're used.
369000	373240	So if we start using words in a new way, the new use determines the new meaning, and grammars
373240	375760	can be created or destroyed to suit our purposes.
375760	379360	You know, language is a human tool, not a dictate of the gods.
379360	382640	Wittgenstein also compared language to an ancient city, since language is always built
382640	384320	around the ruins of its own past.
384320	388640	This is also why I think the non-binary pronoun they is more likely to catch on than new inventions
388680	392640	like Z in here, because it's just a more natural way for the language to evolve.
392640	396360	But you know, Wittgenstein was also another one of these boring, unfunny, self-loathing
396360	400160	gay Jews, so, you know, what is with these guys?
400160	401160	Argument 5.
401160	403640	Non-binary people are just special snowflake trans-crenders.
403640	408680	Well, there's no doubt that non-binary genders are having a bit of a moment right now.
408680	412920	And you could ask, will all of these neologisms stick, you know, words like cloudgender and
412920	417320	greygender and astrogender, and the answer is that probably no, most of them won't.
417320	419040	But some of them probably will.
419040	422560	And while this gender inventiveness has probably gotten a little bit out of hand, I'm sure
422560	425880	it's always been the case that there are people who don't really fit into either gender,
425880	429760	and it's probably always going to be the case, and surely a society that makes room
429760	432120	for those people is more humane than one that doesn't.
432120	435240	And while the current wave of gender inventors will probably make some mistakes along the
435240	438000	way, I for one admire their experimentation.
438000	440640	For one thing, they've paved the way for the rest of us normies to become a little
440640	442180	more fluid ourselves.
442180	443180	And why not?
443180	444180	It's fun.
444180	448500	So if we allow non-binary genders, then soon people's genders will be pineapple and mayonnaise.
448500	449500	Good.
449500	451400	Let's have pineapple and mayonnaise genders.
451400	453620	And this is where I'd like to see the radical feminists get on board.
453620	457600	I mean, patriarchy cannot possibly exist in a society where a significant number of people
457600	459220	are mayonnaise gender.
459220	462080	How am I supposed to explain to my child?
462080	463080	Kill your shitty child.
463080	464080	Then you won't have to explain anything.
464080	467020	Seriously, though, I think kids should be confused by gender, because it doesn't make
467020	468020	any goddamn sense.
468020	472140	In traditional agrarian societies, it made sense to divide people up by sex and assign
472140	473260	them different roles.
473260	477100	All there was to do in life was farm and reproduce, so men used their school biceps to plow the
477100	480380	mule and women bled on the birthing bed, and it was a pretty good system.
480380	484140	But in a capitalist, individualistic society, it doesn't really make sense to assign people
484140	486860	rigid roles based on what reproductive organs they have.
486860	489780	We know from history and anthropology that gender is pretty variable.
489780	492440	So I say, let's reinvent it to suit our purposes.
492440	496120	We should be celebrating, not mocking, the gender deviance of our own time.
496120	498960	After all, they're paving the way for the future, when our great-grandchildren will
498960	502780	plug their brains directly into the simulation to avoid the climate change-induced nightmare
502820	505420	that is what's left of the physical and biological realm.
505420	509660	There will be no more men and women in this world, only quad-gender wolfkin shamans endlessly
509660	512660	pollulating over the sunny plains of Azeroth.
512660	516380	And that, frankly, is a paradise I'm looking forward to.
516380	519900	If you liked this video, consider sending me a dollar or two on Patreon.
519900	523540	If you're broke, or if you don't like me that much, understandably, well, you can leave
523540	524540	a comment.
524540	525540	Tell me you love me.
525540	527540	The greatest love of all is happening to me.
527540	530540	The greatest love of all is inside me.
532780	539420	Patron Nick Wolf asks, who is the better hair, The Amazing Atheist or Thunderf00t?
539420	540980	Well, they both have real potential.
540980	544140	Thunderf00t has a lot of volume, but his hair is just extremely frizzy, probably because
544140	545140	it's dry.
545140	547620	Some deep conditioning and less frequent shampooing would fix this.
547620	550780	The Amazing Atheist has straight hair similar to mine, which is easier to manage, but again
550780	553540	it looks dry and wiry, probably due to inadequate conditioning.
553540	556260	I'm gonna have to go with Thunderf00t on this one, though, since if he'd just take better
556260	559460	care of it, his hair could really attain that early 18th century look, which I know isn't
559460	561260	everyone's jam, but it's certainly what I'm into.
561260	562260	Oh, and one more thing.
562260	565100	If you want to give me money but don't like recurring donations, I now have a PayPal link
565100	566580	in the description, so yay!
566580	567580	I love you.
