00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
So YouTube's all in an uproar, because apparently there are too many genders.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.600
There are simply too many notes, Hamletzart.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.480
You see, when we were kids, boys played with tiny skateboards and girls played with urine.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.640
Potty feels like magic and it flushes out loud.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.760
The cosmic order was in balance, but now there's demigweers and trigenders and everyone wants

00:18.760 --> 00:19.760
to kill themselves.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.760
But you know what?

00:20.760 --> 00:23.040
Maybe hold off on the bleach for a second, Barry Hamlet.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.520
I say we give this thing a shot.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.920
But if we're gonna do that, we're gonna need to get into the spirit of the thing.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.400
So I think we're at a point where most civilized people accept homosexuality, and we seem to

01:09.400 --> 01:13.360
even be making progress in the transgender issue, but non-binary genders are where the

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
line has been drawn.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.280
Now, I don't identify as non-binary myself.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.400
In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Blue Man Muddy Waters pronounces the word

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
man.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Say it again.

01:22.400 --> 01:28.480
If you mispronounce it, I will be triggered.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.320
The point is I can't claim to speak for people who are non-binary, but what I can do is look

01:32.320 --> 01:35.920
at arguments against non-binary identities and see if they have any merit.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.880
I say arguments against because I don't think non-binary people need to provide any arguments

01:39.880 --> 01:44.200
in support of their own existence, because, unlike most of you, I am a real American,

01:44.200 --> 01:50.740
which means that I believe in a little thing you may have forgotten about called freedom.

01:50.740 --> 01:51.740
Argument one.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.440
It's new and different and I don't like it.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.160
The vast majority of people I see objecting to non-binary identities are people who are

01:57.200 --> 02:01.280
basically just repulsed by something that's new and different and ridiculous to them.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.760
I identify as an attack helicopter.

02:04.760 --> 02:12.680
It's funny because you could never use a helicopter in combat.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.120
It should, but doesn't go without saying, that finding something weird and distasteful

02:16.120 --> 02:18.400
does not in itself amount to an argument against it.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.080
I find it especially hard to sympathize with this view, since I have a personality type

02:22.080 --> 02:26.040
that just kind of goes along with things, almost to a pathological extent.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.840
Like, normal human beings are repulsed by things like incest and cannibalism, but I

02:29.840 --> 02:32.960
kind of just don't have any emotions at all about those things.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.160
And if someone tells me they alternate between three different gender identities, my initial

02:36.160 --> 02:40.520
response is to say, really, that's interesting, tell me more.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.440
You know, I'm not repulsed, if anything, I'm attracted.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.520
If you think I'm comparing non-binary identities to cannibalism, here's the address to complain

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
to.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
Argument two.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.440
This is just made up because there's no science to support it.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.640
It's very interesting for me as a transsexual to see so many people running around claiming

02:55.720 --> 03:00.160
all these crazy gender identities, when in reality, being transgender is an actual medical

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
diagnosis.

03:01.160 --> 03:05.080
It means you've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is basically an extreme discontent

03:05.080 --> 03:06.080
with one's own gender.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.960
So Blair's argument is that being transsexual is a medical diagnosis, whereas being non-binary

03:10.960 --> 03:15.280
isn't, and therefore the former is a real phenomenon, whereas the latter is just make-believe.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.720
But for one thing, this is just an appeal to the authority of current medical practice.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.040
Five seconds ago, homosexuality was an actual medical diagnosis.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.960
Monarchs make shit up as they go just as much as anyone, and they invent new words

03:25.960 --> 03:27.960
to describe new conditions all the time.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.840
For another thing, non-binary gender isn't primarily a medical issue in the first place.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.080
Keep in mind that there's multiple dimensions to gender.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.960
There's biological sex, male, female, intersex.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.480
There's social roles, including things like mannerisms, style, dress, what kinds of work

03:41.480 --> 03:43.240
and relationships are open to you.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.480
And then there's identity, which is your inner sense of what gender you are.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.400
And gender identity is what's in question here, so I really don't see why we need a

03:49.400 --> 03:51.440
biological basis for validation.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.320
You know, there's probably no gay gene, but there's definitely gay people, and we

03:54.320 --> 03:56.200
didn't need brain scans to figure that out.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.480
For another thing, there isn't very much in the way of scientific research on non-binary

03:59.480 --> 04:00.480
genders yet.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.520
We can't have scientific terms for things until scientists decide to study them.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
Argument three.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.060
I don't feel like a gender, therefore no one else does either.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.680
So to me, gender identity is kind of a confusing topic, since I personally don't have any

04:11.680 --> 04:14.200
strong feelings of identifying with a gender at all.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.160
I look inside myself and I ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

04:17.160 --> 04:19.560
And the answer is that I feel like shit.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.720
I mean, it's just hollow in here.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.280
To me, gender is all costumes, it's all charade, I choose to perform masculinity because that's

04:26.280 --> 04:28.640
what I've been conditioned to do and it's just easiest.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.720
But I feel irony toward gender roles and a kind of distance from my body.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.800
If I woke up tomorrow with tits and a vagina, I think I could probably roll with it.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.680
You know, I get to wear better clothes.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.080
But the only time I really feel like a woman is when I listen to Lionel Richie.

04:41.080 --> 04:50.600
Yes, you once, you twice, three times a lady.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
Oh yeah.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
That's the stuff.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.120
And the only times I feel like a man are when I listen to Muddy Waters and when I'm having

04:57.120 --> 04:59.360
sex with a woman, which feels very natural.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
You could try it sometime.

05:00.360 --> 05:06.000
You know, God smiles down, the angels trumpets sound, the maiden is laid bare, the intrepid

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
knight bounces.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.040
Oh, for fuck's sake!

05:09.040 --> 05:11.040
What do you want?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
Oh, Jesus.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
Dark Mother, what is it now?

05:25.040 --> 05:29.040
You dare make a video about feminism and not mention me!

05:29.040 --> 05:31.040
This video isn't even about feminism!

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
It definitely isn't about video games.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.080
But every video must be about me, because I'm the most important woman in the world!

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
No.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
You know what?

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Fuck that.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
I'm not doing this anymore.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.080
SILENCE!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.080
Alright.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.080
Suck your goddamn c**t.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.080
Man, I'm tired of this shit.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
Argument 4.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.080
I refuse to call people by non-binary pronouns because it's not grammatical English.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.680
What do you people think language is, anyway?

06:00.720 --> 06:03.720
You do realize it's just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.440
According to Wittgenstein, yeah I'm pulling this card, the meaning of words is determined

06:07.440 --> 06:09.000
merely by the way they're used.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.240
So if we start using words in a new way, the new use determines the new meaning, and grammars

06:13.240 --> 06:15.760
can be created or destroyed to suit our purposes.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.360
You know, language is a human tool, not a dictate of the gods.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.640
Wittgenstein also compared language to an ancient city, since language is always built

06:22.640 --> 06:24.320
around the ruins of its own past.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.640
This is also why I think the non-binary pronoun they is more likely to catch on than new inventions

06:28.680 --> 06:32.640
like Z in here, because it's just a more natural way for the language to evolve.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.360
But you know, Wittgenstein was also another one of these boring, unfunny, self-loathing

06:36.360 --> 06:40.160
gay Jews, so, you know, what is with these guys?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
Argument 5.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.640
Non-binary people are just special snowflake trans-crenders.

06:43.640 --> 06:48.680
Well, there's no doubt that non-binary genders are having a bit of a moment right now.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.920
And you could ask, will all of these neologisms stick, you know, words like cloudgender and

06:52.920 --> 06:57.320
greygender and astrogender, and the answer is that probably no, most of them won't.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.040
But some of them probably will.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.560
And while this gender inventiveness has probably gotten a little bit out of hand, I'm sure

07:02.560 --> 07:05.880
it's always been the case that there are people who don't really fit into either gender,

07:05.880 --> 07:09.760
and it's probably always going to be the case, and surely a society that makes room

07:09.760 --> 07:12.120
for those people is more humane than one that doesn't.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.240
And while the current wave of gender inventors will probably make some mistakes along the

07:15.240 --> 07:18.000
way, I for one admire their experimentation.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.640
For one thing, they've paved the way for the rest of us normies to become a little

07:20.640 --> 07:22.180
more fluid ourselves.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.180
And why not?

07:23.180 --> 07:24.180
It's fun.

07:24.180 --> 07:28.500
So if we allow non-binary genders, then soon people's genders will be pineapple and mayonnaise.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
Good.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.400
Let's have pineapple and mayonnaise genders.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.620
And this is where I'd like to see the radical feminists get on board.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.600
I mean, patriarchy cannot possibly exist in a society where a significant number of people

07:37.600 --> 07:39.220
are mayonnaise gender.

07:39.220 --> 07:42.080
How am I supposed to explain to my child?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
Kill your shitty child.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
Then you won't have to explain anything.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.020
Seriously, though, I think kids should be confused by gender, because it doesn't make

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
any goddamn sense.

07:48.020 --> 07:52.140
In traditional agrarian societies, it made sense to divide people up by sex and assign

07:52.140 --> 07:53.260
them different roles.

07:53.260 --> 07:57.100
All there was to do in life was farm and reproduce, so men used their school biceps to plow the

07:57.100 --> 08:00.380
mule and women bled on the birthing bed, and it was a pretty good system.

08:00.380 --> 08:04.140
But in a capitalist, individualistic society, it doesn't really make sense to assign people

08:04.140 --> 08:06.860
rigid roles based on what reproductive organs they have.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.780
We know from history and anthropology that gender is pretty variable.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.440
So I say, let's reinvent it to suit our purposes.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.120
We should be celebrating, not mocking, the gender deviance of our own time.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.960
After all, they're paving the way for the future, when our great-grandchildren will

08:18.960 --> 08:22.780
plug their brains directly into the simulation to avoid the climate change-induced nightmare

08:22.820 --> 08:25.420
that is what's left of the physical and biological realm.

08:25.420 --> 08:29.660
There will be no more men and women in this world, only quad-gender wolfkin shamans endlessly

08:29.660 --> 08:32.660
pollulating over the sunny plains of Azeroth.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.380
And that, frankly, is a paradise I'm looking forward to.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.900
If you liked this video, consider sending me a dollar or two on Patreon.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.540
If you're broke, or if you don't like me that much, understandably, well, you can leave

08:43.540 --> 08:44.540
a comment.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.540
Tell me you love me.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.540
The greatest love of all is happening to me.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.540
The greatest love of all is inside me.

08:52.780 --> 08:59.420
Patron Nick Wolf asks, who is the better hair, The Amazing Atheist or Thunderf00t?

08:59.420 --> 09:00.980
Well, they both have real potential.

09:00.980 --> 09:04.140
Thunderf00t has a lot of volume, but his hair is just extremely frizzy, probably because

09:04.140 --> 09:05.140
it's dry.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.620
Some deep conditioning and less frequent shampooing would fix this.

09:07.620 --> 09:10.780
The Amazing Atheist has straight hair similar to mine, which is easier to manage, but again

09:10.780 --> 09:13.540
it looks dry and wiry, probably due to inadequate conditioning.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.260
I'm gonna have to go with Thunderf00t on this one, though, since if he'd just take better

09:16.260 --> 09:19.460
care of it, his hair could really attain that early 18th century look, which I know isn't

09:19.460 --> 09:21.260
everyone's jam, but it's certainly what I'm into.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.260
Oh, and one more thing.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.100
If you want to give me money but don't like recurring donations, I now have a PayPal link

09:25.100 --> 09:26.580
in the description, so yay!

09:26.580 --> 09:27.580
I love you.
