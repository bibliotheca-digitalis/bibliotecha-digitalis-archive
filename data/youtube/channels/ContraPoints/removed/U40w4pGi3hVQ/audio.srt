00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Welcome to the lab.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,760
Let's see what's on the slab.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
Shh!

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,760
Let the examination begin.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:39,200
Part negative two.

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,600
The pleb to your way of thinking about gender is rigid, binary, and naturalistic.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,240
There is penis, there is vagine, and that's all there is to say about it.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,680
This way of thinking comes in part from certain prejudices favouring the firm, robust, masculine

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,400
hard sciences versus the flaccid, feminine, soft social sciences.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,520
But the thing is, even if you're a science pro, you should appreciate that this kind

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,680
of black and white rigidity is not a good way to think about anything.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,040
Even Richard Dawkins, the most manly, robust, skeptical science man in the world, came up

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,040
with a thought experiment to illustrate this point in biology.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
It goes like this.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,120
Imagine you take a rabbit and you place her mother next to her, and next to the mother,

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,700
the mother's mother, and in a long line you lay out the lineage of rabbits for millions

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,920
of generations.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,560
Eventually, you get to an ancestor that is definitely not a rabbit, it's say, the common

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,360
ancestor of the rabbit and the duck, or whatever the fuck peeps are.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
So at one end of the line you have an ordinary modern rabbit, and at the other some kind

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,400
of prehistoric animal that is definitely not a rabbit, though from each generation

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,780
to the next, the difference between mother and daughter is imperceptible.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,840
So, without ever arriving at a definite point where we can say, this is the boundary dividing

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,860
the rabbits from the non-rabbits, there is nonetheless a continuous genealogy of organisms

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,080
leading from non-rabbits to rabbits.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,500
So what we have on our hands here is a spectrum of rabbitness, you can compare it to the spectrum

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,720
between boys and men.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,480
A ten year old is a boy, a thirty year old is a man, and somewhere between the boy becomes

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,120
a man, though there's no definite day where the dividing line occurs.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,280
But the human brain does not like this idea.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,340
We naturally prefer binaries to spectrums, which could be why most traditional societies

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,760
have some kind of ritual that marks the moment when a boy becomes a man, usually involving

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
doing some kind of fucked up shit to kids.

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,640
Good thing I inhaled all that gas.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
What is it with men?

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,600
So words like man and rabbit are nouns, and nouns generally have a binary function in

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
our grammar.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,320
We don't have a word for something that's slightly a rabbit, moderately a rabbit, or

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,600
mostly but not all a rabbit.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,440
Things are either rabbits or they aren't, but that's just a rule of the English language,

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,900
and nature does not abide by the rules of English.

42
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,840
This kind of discrepancy between the way words are used and the way biology actually works

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,520
is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to explain the concept of evolution to people

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
who are new to the idea.

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,200
As the beautiful old creationist proverb goes, a monkey cannot give birth to a man, it ain't

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
natural.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,040
But thinking about it certainly turns me on.

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm just going to palpate the interior here, palpate, palpate, palpate, oh shit.

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,800
Congratulations it's a rabbit!

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,320
Part negative one, biological sex.

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,080
So the boundaries of the concept rabbit seem well defined at first, but any attempt to

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,000
actually define what those boundaries are seems to fail, and the same is true with pretty

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
much any word we want to define.

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,480
So take for instance the concept of a chair, an example philosophers like to use because

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
they sit on their asses all day doing absolutely nothing of value to society.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,320
How do you decide what is and isn't a chair?

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,680
One way you could do this is to come up with a list of necessary or sufficient conditions

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
that describe what counts as a chair.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,560
So for example you could say that a chair is a man-made object with a backrest that

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
people sit on.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,640
Well, but what about a rock naturally shaped like a chair that people sit on?

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,960
What about a sculpture of a chair that no one sits on?

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,760
What if the chair was made by a woman you misogynistic trash?

64
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,240
It's not really possible to come up with a list of conditions that defines every way

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
we use the word chair.

66
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,760
Instead what we have are a bunch of related properties, like being man-made, being sat

67
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,440
on, and so on, none of which is alone necessary or sufficient to define what it really means

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
to be a chair.

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
So with that in mind, what happens when we try to define the biological categories of

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,760
male and female?

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Well, the first thing we might do is come up with a list of anatomical features, including

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,000
chromosomes, gonads, genitals, hormones, and secondary sex characteristics.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,920
We might see a female as a person with XX sex chromosomes, ovaries, a vagina, a certain

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,480
hormone balance, and secondary sex characteristics like breasts and soft skin that you just

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,200
want to pour milk all over.

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,040
But hold on, we know that there are transsexual women who have female secondary sex characteristics,

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
hormone balance, and genitals, but not ovaries or XX chromosomes.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,160
So insisting there are exactly two biological sex categories leaves us unable to accurately

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,160
describe the anatomy of people who don't conform to our preconceived conceptual schema.

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Now some geniuses think they can solve that problem by pronouncing that henceforth only

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,680
chromosomes shall be used to determine sex.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,880
But even insisting on a purely chromosome-based categorization doesn't always work, because

83
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,520
there are intersex people who have just an X chromosome, or XXY, XYY, XXX, or other atypical

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,780
karyotypes.

85
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,640
There are also people with a condition called Swyer syndrome, who are born with a uterus,

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,280
fallopian tubes, a cervix, and a vagina, but have XY sex chromosomes.

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,560
Now if you're aware of all this and you still want to insist on strictly binary sexual

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,840
categories, then you're trying to force reality to fit your preconceived conceptual

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,200
scheme instead of adapting your concepts to fit reality.

90
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,560
And that is what bad science looks like.

91
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
I haven't even started talking about gender yet.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,560
I've been so goddamn busy prematurely cockblocking the penetrating scientific insights of armchair

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
anatomists.

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,520
Now this is the part of the video where I'm sure you've already guessed that I say gender

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,560
is different from biological sex, and yes, it is a social construct.

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,040
But what is a social construct?

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,520
A common misconception is that something's being a social construct means that it has

98
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,120
no reality, that it's just a figment of the imagination, but that is not the case.

99
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Money is a social construct, but money is very real.

100
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,480
All our lives are structured around money to some extent, and the limits placed on us

101
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,960
by our finances can often be just as restrictive as the limits placed by the laws of gravity.

102
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,960
However, the difference between gravity and money is that gravity works the same way no

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,040
matter how humans behave, whereas the very existence of money is contingent on certain

104
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,840
human behaviors and beliefs.

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
If our practices change, money changes.

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,320
Does gold in World of Warcraft count as money?

107
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,120
Well, does it work like money?

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,560
Yeah, pretty much.

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,720
So it's money.

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Welcome to cyberreality.

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,640
And you would be foolish to try to determine the monetary value of actual gold by investigating

112
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
its chemical properties.

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,240
Instead, you should investigate the economic behavior of human beings, and the symbolic

114
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
function of gold in our societies.

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
The same goes for gender.

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,960
Examining human bodies is a lot more fun than doing sociology, but chromosomes and genitals

117
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,080
will not tell you which gender wears lipstick, or raises the children, or scars the skin

118
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
in order to embody the spirit of the crocodile.

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,000
So even though social science is soft and girly and unrobust, if we're serious about

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,920
understanding gender, it's kind of the only option we have.

121
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,360
Because not everything is reducible to biology.

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,920
Sometimes people with XY chromosomes have soft, smooth skin that I just want to pour

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,800
milk over, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it because I'm an adult and it's

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,240
my choice, and it's my right, and it's not harming anyone so just leave me alone.

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,560
One popular way of trying to make sense of gender is depicted in a diagram called the

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
genderbread person.

127
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,880
The diagram shows a series of sliders representing spectrums of biological sex, gender expression,

128
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
and identity.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,440
The sex spectrum represents intersex and transsexual people better than the binary categories.

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,520
The identity slider represents the psychological aspects of gender, including transgender and

131
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,640
non-binary identities, and the expression slider represents the social performance of

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
gender.

133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,440
So this way of defining gender is a lot more sophisticated than the view that refuses to

134
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
look beyond biology.

135
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,720
But the genderbread person is still a massive simplification, since it presents the poles

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,200
of these spectrums, like masculinity and femininity, as if they were eternal and stable, when in

137
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,160
fact they're socially constructed and historically contingent.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,280
The 18th century idea of masculinity is very different from, say, the contemporary hipster

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,400
idea of masculinity, and class and racial distinctions are excluded from the diagram

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
altogether.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,840
So if we want to know what gender is in the sense of the social behavior of gender, then

142
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,000
we should just ask sociologists, anthropologists, and historians, and they'll tell us that

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,360
there are as many masculinities and femininities as there are cultures.

144
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,160
But that still doesn't answer what it means to psychologically identify as a man or a

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,280
woman, nor does it tell me the relationship between society's norms and me as an individual.

146
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,760
But that's what I really want to know.

147
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,840
I want to know who I am inside.

148
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,760
What to make of all this emptiness.

149
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
Whether I'm a man or a woman or something else.

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,760
I just want to know who I am, dack.

151
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
It's 2017, man.

152
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I don't know what gender I am.

153
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Now listen to Synthwave.

154
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's do some das.

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,760
It's fucking 2017, man.

156
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,760
If you want to advocate against gender injustice, you're gonna need to come up with an account

157
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
of what it means to be a woman in order to make sense of what you're doing.

158
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
And feminists with different political goals will tend to define womanhood differently.

159
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,200
So TERFs, who think that patriarchal oppression is based solely on the reproductive anatomy

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,760
of women's bodies, basically end up back on the same page as the science bros.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
There is penis, there is vagine.

162
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Penis oppresses vagine.

163
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Now a more sophisticated radical feminist like Catherine McKinnon might argue that the

164
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,760
essential thing is not anatomy, but a certain kind of power dynamic, womanhood being defined

165
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
by sexual submission and objectification.

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Whereas a queer feminist like Judith Butler might want to place more emphasis on the performative

167
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,760
nature of gender, and on the possibility of queering practices like drag to reveal its

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
contingent and imitative nature.

169
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,760
And a transgender feminist will more likely want to define womanhood in terms of a psychological

170
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,760
state, perhaps a proprioceptive sense of belonging in a woman's body.

171
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
So which of these definitions are correct?

172
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Well, all of them are, in a way.

173
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,760
We should adopt whatever definition makes the most sense in a given context.

174
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,760
If we're advocating for abortion rights, it makes sense to take the biological view.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
But if we're talking about the way women are treated in public spaces, it might make

176
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
more sense to take the performative view.

177
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
We have to always try to understand a broad concept like gender in a given context.

178
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
It's like yeah, in some contexts I prefer to pour milk on someone else's face, but

179
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,760
in other contexts I like someone to pour hot milk all over my goddamn face and t-t-t-t-t.

180
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Ah, fuck.

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Nurse, get my lawyer on the phone.

182
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Babies, I'm sorry.

183
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Part Infinity.

184
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Final Enlightenment.

185
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Now maybe you're not satisfied with this answer.

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
You're thinking it's fine to have operational definitions of something for a specific purpose,

187
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
but you want to know what gender is, really.

188
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
What does it really mean to be a man or a woman?

189
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Well, these are philosophical questions, and the defining feature of philosophical questions

190
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
is that they have no final answer.

191
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Philosophy can only take you to the end of a cul-de-sac.

192
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It can help you understand the cul-de-sac, but that's as far as our little monkey brains can go.

193
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Once you reach the dead end, that's it.

194
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
You're done.

195
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
There's no more thinking you can do.

196
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,760
It's time to sit back, relax, and get inspired to live each moment bolder and louder.

197
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
With a nice cold Pepsi.

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Amen.

199
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Amen.

200
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
I love you.

201
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,760
It's fucking 2017, man.
