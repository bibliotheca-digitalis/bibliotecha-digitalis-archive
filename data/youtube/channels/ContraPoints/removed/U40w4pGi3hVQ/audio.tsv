0	4360	Welcome to the lab.
4360	5760	Let's see what's on the slab.
5760	6760	Shh!
6760	9760	Let the examination begin.
9760	39200	Part negative two.
40200	44600	The pleb to your way of thinking about gender is rigid, binary, and naturalistic.
44600	49240	There is penis, there is vagine, and that's all there is to say about it.
49240	53680	This way of thinking comes in part from certain prejudices favouring the firm, robust, masculine
53680	58400	hard sciences versus the flaccid, feminine, soft social sciences.
58400	62520	But the thing is, even if you're a science pro, you should appreciate that this kind
62520	65680	of black and white rigidity is not a good way to think about anything.
65680	70040	Even Richard Dawkins, the most manly, robust, skeptical science man in the world, came up
70040	73040	with a thought experiment to illustrate this point in biology.
73040	74360	It goes like this.
74360	78120	Imagine you take a rabbit and you place her mother next to her, and next to the mother,
78120	81700	the mother's mother, and in a long line you lay out the lineage of rabbits for millions
81700	82920	of generations.
82920	87560	Eventually, you get to an ancestor that is definitely not a rabbit, it's say, the common
87560	91360	ancestor of the rabbit and the duck, or whatever the fuck peeps are.
91360	94960	So at one end of the line you have an ordinary modern rabbit, and at the other some kind
94960	98400	of prehistoric animal that is definitely not a rabbit, though from each generation
98400	101780	to the next, the difference between mother and daughter is imperceptible.
101780	105840	So, without ever arriving at a definite point where we can say, this is the boundary dividing
105840	109860	the rabbits from the non-rabbits, there is nonetheless a continuous genealogy of organisms
109860	112080	leading from non-rabbits to rabbits.
112080	116500	So what we have on our hands here is a spectrum of rabbitness, you can compare it to the spectrum
116500	117720	between boys and men.
117720	122480	A ten year old is a boy, a thirty year old is a man, and somewhere between the boy becomes
122480	126120	a man, though there's no definite day where the dividing line occurs.
126120	128280	But the human brain does not like this idea.
128280	132340	We naturally prefer binaries to spectrums, which could be why most traditional societies
132340	136760	have some kind of ritual that marks the moment when a boy becomes a man, usually involving
136760	138560	doing some kind of fucked up shit to kids.
138560	140640	Good thing I inhaled all that gas.
140640	142520	What is it with men?
142520	146600	So words like man and rabbit are nouns, and nouns generally have a binary function in
146600	147600	our grammar.
147600	151320	We don't have a word for something that's slightly a rabbit, moderately a rabbit, or
151320	154600	mostly but not all a rabbit.
154600	158440	Things are either rabbits or they aren't, but that's just a rule of the English language,
158440	160900	and nature does not abide by the rules of English.
160900	164840	This kind of discrepancy between the way words are used and the way biology actually works
164840	168520	is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to explain the concept of evolution to people
168520	169720	who are new to the idea.
169720	175200	As the beautiful old creationist proverb goes, a monkey cannot give birth to a man, it ain't
175200	176200	natural.
176200	178040	But thinking about it certainly turns me on.
178680	184920	I'm just going to palpate the interior here, palpate, palpate, palpate, oh shit.
184920	187800	Congratulations it's a rabbit!
187800	191320	Part negative one, biological sex.
191320	195080	So the boundaries of the concept rabbit seem well defined at first, but any attempt to
195080	199000	actually define what those boundaries are seems to fail, and the same is true with pretty
199000	200520	much any word we want to define.
200520	204480	So take for instance the concept of a chair, an example philosophers like to use because
204480	208000	they sit on their asses all day doing absolutely nothing of value to society.
208000	210320	How do you decide what is and isn't a chair?
210320	213680	One way you could do this is to come up with a list of necessary or sufficient conditions
213680	215760	that describe what counts as a chair.
215760	219560	So for example you could say that a chair is a man-made object with a backrest that
219560	220560	people sit on.
220560	223640	Well, but what about a rock naturally shaped like a chair that people sit on?
223640	225960	What about a sculpture of a chair that no one sits on?
225960	228760	What if the chair was made by a woman you misogynistic trash?
228760	232240	It's not really possible to come up with a list of conditions that defines every way
232240	234000	we use the word chair.
234040	237760	Instead what we have are a bunch of related properties, like being man-made, being sat
237760	242440	on, and so on, none of which is alone necessary or sufficient to define what it really means
242440	243440	to be a chair.
243440	246640	So with that in mind, what happens when we try to define the biological categories of
246640	247760	male and female?
247760	251680	Well, the first thing we might do is come up with a list of anatomical features, including
251680	257000	chromosomes, gonads, genitals, hormones, and secondary sex characteristics.
257000	261920	We might see a female as a person with XX sex chromosomes, ovaries, a vagina, a certain
261920	266480	hormone balance, and secondary sex characteristics like breasts and soft skin that you just
266480	268200	want to pour milk all over.
268200	273040	But hold on, we know that there are transsexual women who have female secondary sex characteristics,
273040	276880	hormone balance, and genitals, but not ovaries or XX chromosomes.
276880	281160	So insisting there are exactly two biological sex categories leaves us unable to accurately
281160	285160	describe the anatomy of people who don't conform to our preconceived conceptual schema.
285160	289160	Now some geniuses think they can solve that problem by pronouncing that henceforth only
289160	291680	chromosomes shall be used to determine sex.
291680	295880	But even insisting on a purely chromosome-based categorization doesn't always work, because
295880	302520	there are intersex people who have just an X chromosome, or XXY, XYY, XXX, or other atypical
302520	303780	karyotypes.
303780	307640	There are also people with a condition called Swyer syndrome, who are born with a uterus,
307640	311280	fallopian tubes, a cervix, and a vagina, but have XY sex chromosomes.
311280	315560	Now if you're aware of all this and you still want to insist on strictly binary sexual
315560	318840	categories, then you're trying to force reality to fit your preconceived conceptual
318840	322200	scheme instead of adapting your concepts to fit reality.
322200	324560	And that is what bad science looks like.
338560	340600	I haven't even started talking about gender yet.
340600	345560	I've been so goddamn busy prematurely cockblocking the penetrating scientific insights of armchair
345560	346560	anatomists.
346560	349520	Now this is the part of the video where I'm sure you've already guessed that I say gender
349520	353560	is different from biological sex, and yes, it is a social construct.
353560	355040	But what is a social construct?
355040	358520	A common misconception is that something's being a social construct means that it has
358520	363120	no reality, that it's just a figment of the imagination, but that is not the case.
363120	366120	Money is a social construct, but money is very real.
366120	369480	All our lives are structured around money to some extent, and the limits placed on us
369480	373960	by our finances can often be just as restrictive as the limits placed by the laws of gravity.
373960	377960	However, the difference between gravity and money is that gravity works the same way no
377960	382040	matter how humans behave, whereas the very existence of money is contingent on certain
382040	383840	human behaviors and beliefs.
383840	386160	If our practices change, money changes.
386160	388320	Does gold in World of Warcraft count as money?
388320	390120	Well, does it work like money?
390120	391560	Yeah, pretty much.
391560	392720	So it's money.
392720	396720	Welcome to cyberreality.
396720	400640	And you would be foolish to try to determine the monetary value of actual gold by investigating
400640	402200	its chemical properties.
402200	406240	Instead, you should investigate the economic behavior of human beings, and the symbolic
406240	408200	function of gold in our societies.
408200	409880	The same goes for gender.
409880	413960	Examining human bodies is a lot more fun than doing sociology, but chromosomes and genitals
413960	418080	will not tell you which gender wears lipstick, or raises the children, or scars the skin
418080	420720	in order to embody the spirit of the crocodile.
420720	425000	So even though social science is soft and girly and unrobust, if we're serious about
425000	427920	understanding gender, it's kind of the only option we have.
427920	430360	Because not everything is reducible to biology.
430360	433920	Sometimes people with XY chromosomes have soft, smooth skin that I just want to pour
433920	437800	milk over, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it because I'm an adult and it's
437800	444240	my choice, and it's my right, and it's not harming anyone so just leave me alone.
444240	447560	One popular way of trying to make sense of gender is depicted in a diagram called the
447560	448960	genderbread person.
448960	453880	The diagram shows a series of sliders representing spectrums of biological sex, gender expression,
453880	454880	and identity.
454880	459440	The sex spectrum represents intersex and transsexual people better than the binary categories.
459440	463520	The identity slider represents the psychological aspects of gender, including transgender and
463520	467640	non-binary identities, and the expression slider represents the social performance of
467640	468640	gender.
468640	471440	So this way of defining gender is a lot more sophisticated than the view that refuses to
471440	472640	look beyond biology.
472640	476720	But the genderbread person is still a massive simplification, since it presents the poles
476720	481200	of these spectrums, like masculinity and femininity, as if they were eternal and stable, when in
481200	484160	fact they're socially constructed and historically contingent.
484160	488280	The 18th century idea of masculinity is very different from, say, the contemporary hipster
488280	492400	idea of masculinity, and class and racial distinctions are excluded from the diagram
492400	493400	altogether.
493400	496840	So if we want to know what gender is in the sense of the social behavior of gender, then
496840	501000	we should just ask sociologists, anthropologists, and historians, and they'll tell us that
501000	504360	there are as many masculinities and femininities as there are cultures.
504360	508160	But that still doesn't answer what it means to psychologically identify as a man or a
508160	512280	woman, nor does it tell me the relationship between society's norms and me as an individual.
512280	513760	But that's what I really want to know.
513760	515840	I want to know who I am inside.
515840	517760	What to make of all this emptiness.
517760	520400	Whether I'm a man or a woman or something else.
520400	522760	I just want to know who I am, dack.
529760	531760	It's 2017, man.
533760	535760	I don't know what gender I am.
538760	540760	Now listen to Synthwave.
542760	544760	Let's do some das.
545760	548760	It's fucking 2017, man.
551760	555760	If you want to advocate against gender injustice, you're gonna need to come up with an account
555760	558760	of what it means to be a woman in order to make sense of what you're doing.
558760	561760	And feminists with different political goals will tend to define womanhood differently.
561760	566200	So TERFs, who think that patriarchal oppression is based solely on the reproductive anatomy
566200	569760	of women's bodies, basically end up back on the same page as the science bros.
569760	572760	There is penis, there is vagine.
572760	573760	Penis oppresses vagine.
573760	577760	Now a more sophisticated radical feminist like Catherine McKinnon might argue that the
577760	582760	essential thing is not anatomy, but a certain kind of power dynamic, womanhood being defined
582760	584760	by sexual submission and objectification.
584760	588760	Whereas a queer feminist like Judith Butler might want to place more emphasis on the performative
588760	593760	nature of gender, and on the possibility of queering practices like drag to reveal its
593760	594760	contingent and imitative nature.
594760	598760	And a transgender feminist will more likely want to define womanhood in terms of a psychological
598760	602760	state, perhaps a proprioceptive sense of belonging in a woman's body.
602760	604760	So which of these definitions are correct?
604760	606760	Well, all of them are, in a way.
606760	610760	We should adopt whatever definition makes the most sense in a given context.
610760	614760	If we're advocating for abortion rights, it makes sense to take the biological view.
614760	617760	But if we're talking about the way women are treated in public spaces, it might make
617760	619760	more sense to take the performative view.
619760	623760	We have to always try to understand a broad concept like gender in a given context.
623760	627760	It's like yeah, in some contexts I prefer to pour milk on someone else's face, but
627760	632760	in other contexts I like someone to pour hot milk all over my goddamn face and t-t-t-t-t.
632760	633760	Ah, fuck.
633760	636760	Nurse, get my lawyer on the phone.
636760	638760	Babies, I'm sorry.
638760	639760	Part Infinity.
639760	640760	Final Enlightenment.
640760	643760	Now maybe you're not satisfied with this answer.
643760	647760	You're thinking it's fine to have operational definitions of something for a specific purpose,
647760	649760	but you want to know what gender is, really.
649760	651760	What does it really mean to be a man or a woman?
651760	655760	Well, these are philosophical questions, and the defining feature of philosophical questions
655760	657760	is that they have no final answer.
657760	660760	Philosophy can only take you to the end of a cul-de-sac.
660760	664760	It can help you understand the cul-de-sac, but that's as far as our little monkey brains can go.
664760	666760	Once you reach the dead end, that's it.
666760	667760	You're done.
667760	669760	There's no more thinking you can do.
669760	675760	It's time to sit back, relax, and get inspired to live each moment bolder and louder.
675760	678760	With a nice cold Pepsi.
685760	687760	Amen.
715760	716760	Amen.
745760	747760	I love you.
751760	754760	It's fucking 2017, man.
