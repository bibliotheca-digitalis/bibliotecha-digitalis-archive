00:00.000 --> 00:08.500
And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to

00:08.500 --> 00:12.120
all the young women out there…

00:12.120 --> 00:15.440
Some of the more cynical feminists out there have suggested that Taylor's Grammy was

00:15.440 --> 00:19.520
not so much a victory for all women as a victory for Taylor Swift, and that this version of

00:19.520 --> 00:23.440
feminism is really just like upper-class white women congratulating themselves for how much

00:23.440 --> 00:25.000
wealth and power they have.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.560
Now I, on the other hand…

00:27.560 --> 00:28.560
Huh.

00:28.560 --> 00:34.160
Well, anyway, the important question is, what would a Taylor Swift song sound like covered

00:34.160 --> 00:35.160
by Bob Dylan?

00:35.160 --> 00:45.160
I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've

00:45.160 --> 00:52.160
never been Till you put me down, oh I knew you were

00:52.160 --> 01:00.160
trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've

01:00.160 --> 01:09.160
never been Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

01:09.160 --> 01:13.960
Trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble

01:13.960 --> 01:15.920
What was God thinking when he designed drugs?

01:15.920 --> 01:19.120
He said, this one will make you alert and awake, but anxious, and you'll have to take

01:19.120 --> 01:20.240
a shit, because fuck you.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.320
When people who are angry about feminism find out that I'm not angry about feminism, they

01:24.320 --> 01:27.680
often present me with evidence of feminists doing something stupid, and then they want

01:27.680 --> 01:29.240
to know, what do I think of that, huh?

01:29.240 --> 01:32.520
And it's hard, because it's not easy to respond to that kind of accusation without

01:32.520 --> 01:35.480
sounding like you're committing some kind of no-true feminist fallacy.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.520
Though it's extremely easy for any asshole with an internet connection to send you a

01:39.520 --> 01:42.200
video of a blue-haired woman saying she hates men.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.400
Haha!

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
Feminism exposed!

01:44.400 --> 01:47.200
But why is there so much bad feminism in the first place?

01:47.200 --> 01:51.320
Well, one reason is that feminism has gotten so big in the last decade that everyone seems

01:51.320 --> 01:54.880
to want to get in on it, leading us to a situation where much of what goes on under the heading

01:54.880 --> 01:56.600
of feminism is just plain nonsense.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.920
In the current year, female mega-millionaires can draw praise for presenting their own personal

02:00.920 --> 02:05.360
success stories as parables about the global empowerment of all womankind, and corporate

02:05.360 --> 02:09.860
marketing has discovered that attaching heartwarming girl-power babble to a brand can attract an

02:09.860 --> 02:13.100
extra kick of publicity from writers of feminist blogs.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.940
If I asked you to run like a girl now, would you do it differently?

02:17.940 --> 02:18.940
I would run like myself.

02:18.940 --> 02:19.940
Would you like a chance to redo it?

02:19.940 --> 02:20.940
Yeah.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.940
My god.

02:21.940 --> 02:38.100
I am ravenous!

02:38.100 --> 02:43.140
I want support for ugly girls and lazy girls and girls that can't ever get their eyeliner

02:43.140 --> 02:44.140
right.

02:44.140 --> 02:47.440
Well, good on them, I guess, for saying ugly girls, instead of disingenuinely insisting

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
that everyone is beautiful.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.540
You mean disingenuously, not disingenuinely, you dumb idiot!

02:52.540 --> 02:54.540
Wretch feminists destroyed!

02:54.540 --> 02:57.560
But should we really be celebrating laziness and incompetence?

02:57.560 --> 03:01.160
If we support people who can't get their eyeliner right, like me in this video, how

03:01.160 --> 03:03.140
are they ever supposed to learn and improve?

03:03.140 --> 03:04.140
We need shame.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.140
Shame!

03:05.140 --> 03:06.140
Let's ban Fosse.

03:06.140 --> 03:07.140
Be brave.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.180
Be you.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.180
Ban Fosse.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.180
No!

03:10.180 --> 03:15.300
If we ban Fosse, then women will end up just like men, and men are fucking assholes.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
I hate men!

03:16.300 --> 03:20.860
Seriously, though, some of the feminist advice given to women is borderline psychopathic.

03:20.860 --> 03:23.740
You know, like, never take no for an answer.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.340
Always take what you want.

03:25.340 --> 03:26.340
This is like rapist advice!

03:26.340 --> 03:30.020
And I get that this is an attempt to turn women into monsters so they can survive in

03:30.020 --> 03:34.460
a monstrous world, but if feminism is genuine social activism instead of just individual

03:34.460 --> 03:38.100
lessons in how to game the corporate shark tank to your advantage, wouldn't it be better

03:38.100 --> 03:41.980
to advocate for a softer, more effeminate world where it's okay to apologize and to

03:41.980 --> 03:42.980
care about other people?

03:42.980 --> 03:47.140
I feel like there's a misogynistic strain in some feminism that resents femininity and

03:47.140 --> 03:48.420
wants women to be more like men.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.580
But I like women the way they are, goddammit!

03:50.580 --> 03:52.060
We shouldn't be trying to turn women into men.

03:52.060 --> 03:55.660
What we should be doing is trying to turn men into women.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.660
Beautiful.

03:56.660 --> 03:57.660
Perfect.

03:57.660 --> 03:58.660
Angels.

03:58.660 --> 03:59.660
Hairless.

03:59.660 --> 03:59.660


04:04.460 --> 04:16.980
Now, if I wanted to, I could probably make an entire career out of complaining about

04:16.980 --> 04:19.020
the things in feminism I don't like.

04:19.020 --> 04:22.380
I'd certainly attract a larger audience and probably more money, but there are already

04:22.380 --> 04:25.860
so many assholes complaining about feminism that I just can't bring myself to do it.

04:25.860 --> 04:29.260
I don't want to be mistaken for one of those, and honestly I don't think it would do any

04:29.260 --> 04:30.540
good for me to do that anyway.

04:30.540 --> 04:33.800
You know, it's one thing when a young woman criticizes the stupid things her peers are

04:33.800 --> 04:38.120
doing on Tumblr or whatever, when you've got like 49-year-old men ranting about the

04:38.120 --> 04:42.600
shit 19-year-old girls are doing, I don't know, I just get kind of a creepy vibe from

04:42.600 --> 04:43.600
it.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.640
It reminds me of when adult men used to complain about Justin Bieber all the time.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.840
Like why do you care so much what music female babies listen to anyway?

04:50.840 --> 04:54.920
I still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her.

04:54.920 --> 04:59.440
People with names like Sammy and Joe, Eddie and Tony, and Peggy and Guy and Patty and

04:59.440 --> 05:04.160
Rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies

05:04.160 --> 05:05.840
were to my palate.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
Ah geez.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.840
Now, one serious problem with junk food feminism is that it potentially distracts from more

05:10.840 --> 05:12.800
substantive feminist activism.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.240
But it's only a distraction to the extent you allow yourself to be distracted by it.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.920
And of course the shitlords of YouTube have every interest in keeping the worst of feminism

05:19.920 --> 05:20.920
in the spotlight.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.520
I know to my ideological opponents it might sound weird for me to say that I'm a feminist

05:24.520 --> 05:27.800
even though I believe a lot of feminism is garbage, but what you have to understand is

05:27.800 --> 05:32.040
that feminism has gotten so huge and so ubiquitous that it's come to resemble the whole of human

05:32.040 --> 05:36.640
life, which is to say that 95% of it is absolute fucking shit, which should come as no surprise.

05:36.640 --> 05:43.120
I mean, 95% of music is shit, 95% of movies are shit, and 99.999% of YouTube videos are

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
shit.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.640
The Earth itself is mostly shit.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.040
It's like shitty deserts and open oceans and cold ass tundras and hot fucking mosquito

05:50.040 --> 05:54.360
rainforests, and there's like plagues of locusts and dinosaurs tearing zebras apart, and the

05:54.360 --> 05:59.080
whole planet is adrift in a cosmos that's 99.9% forever empty, and most of the parts

05:59.080 --> 06:01.840
that aren't empty are bad and violent and shitty.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.120
And all of this is really just a metaphor for the human soul, which spends most of its

06:05.120 --> 06:10.400
time waiting in line, looking at the clock, in traffic, bored, anxious, envious, insecure,

06:10.400 --> 06:14.800
broke, lonely, sick, hungover, aging, working, waiting for the person you have a crush on

06:14.800 --> 06:18.800
to text you back and thinking they definitely hate you, 9-11, vomiting, waiting to text

06:18.800 --> 06:21.480
your crush back because you don't want them to think you like them as much as you do,

06:21.480 --> 06:25.400
begging for forgiveness, drying your iPhone, watching insects die because of the horrible

06:25.400 --> 06:29.560
chemicals you sprayed on them, wretched, creepy, lust, longing for childhood joys that can

06:29.560 --> 06:33.280
never be regained, the encroaching death of passion that slowly rots your marriage, the

06:33.280 --> 06:37.740
fucking Delaware Turnpike, cancer, joyless intoxication, and whatever music it is they

06:37.740 --> 06:40.200
play at fucking CVS.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.440
It's all kind of a bunch of shit, which is why the meaning of life is to seek out the

06:43.440 --> 06:47.400
little moments of ecstasy and redemption that make it all worthwhile, and to try each day

06:47.400 --> 06:51.720
to see the world as interesting and beautiful and strange, or at least it finds it all kind

06:51.720 --> 06:52.720
of funny.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.440
At least, that's the best thing I've been able to come up with.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.000
What's your fucking idea?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.480
If you liked this video, you can follow me in the usual places, and now on Facebook too.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.000
I want to thank all my new patrons for helping to make this video possible.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.560
I have more ideas for videos and time or money to make them, so the more support I get, the

07:09.560 --> 07:10.880
more I can do with this channel.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.040
Each new pledge is a triumph for every single woman on the face of God's grey earth.

07:15.040 --> 07:15.640
Namaste.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.680
Namaste.
