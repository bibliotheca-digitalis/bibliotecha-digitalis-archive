0	8500	And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to
8500	12120	all the young women out there…
12120	15440	Some of the more cynical feminists out there have suggested that Taylor's Grammy was
15440	19520	not so much a victory for all women as a victory for Taylor Swift, and that this version of
19520	23440	feminism is really just like upper-class white women congratulating themselves for how much
23440	25000	wealth and power they have.
25000	27560	Now I, on the other hand…
27560	28560	Huh.
28560	34160	Well, anyway, the important question is, what would a Taylor Swift song sound like covered
34160	35160	by Bob Dylan?
35160	45160	I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've
45160	52160	never been Till you put me down, oh I knew you were
52160	60160	trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've
60160	69160	never been Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
69160	73960	Trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble
73960	75920	What was God thinking when he designed drugs?
75920	79120	He said, this one will make you alert and awake, but anxious, and you'll have to take
79120	80240	a shit, because fuck you.
80240	84320	When people who are angry about feminism find out that I'm not angry about feminism, they
84320	87680	often present me with evidence of feminists doing something stupid, and then they want
87680	89240	to know, what do I think of that, huh?
89240	92520	And it's hard, because it's not easy to respond to that kind of accusation without
92520	95480	sounding like you're committing some kind of no-true feminist fallacy.
95480	99520	Though it's extremely easy for any asshole with an internet connection to send you a
99520	102200	video of a blue-haired woman saying she hates men.
102200	103400	Haha!
103400	104400	Feminism exposed!
104400	107200	But why is there so much bad feminism in the first place?
107200	111320	Well, one reason is that feminism has gotten so big in the last decade that everyone seems
111320	114880	to want to get in on it, leading us to a situation where much of what goes on under the heading
114880	116600	of feminism is just plain nonsense.
116600	120920	In the current year, female mega-millionaires can draw praise for presenting their own personal
120920	125360	success stories as parables about the global empowerment of all womankind, and corporate
125360	129860	marketing has discovered that attaching heartwarming girl-power babble to a brand can attract an
129860	133100	extra kick of publicity from writers of feminist blogs.
133100	137940	If I asked you to run like a girl now, would you do it differently?
137940	138940	I would run like myself.
138940	139940	Would you like a chance to redo it?
139940	140940	Yeah.
140940	141940	My god.
141940	158100	I am ravenous!
158100	163140	I want support for ugly girls and lazy girls and girls that can't ever get their eyeliner
163140	164140	right.
164140	167440	Well, good on them, I guess, for saying ugly girls, instead of disingenuinely insisting
167440	168440	that everyone is beautiful.
168440	172540	You mean disingenuously, not disingenuinely, you dumb idiot!
172540	174540	Wretch feminists destroyed!
174540	177560	But should we really be celebrating laziness and incompetence?
177560	181160	If we support people who can't get their eyeliner right, like me in this video, how
181160	183140	are they ever supposed to learn and improve?
183140	184140	We need shame.
184140	185140	Shame!
185140	186140	Let's ban Fosse.
186140	187140	Be brave.
187180	188180	Be you.
188180	189180	Ban Fosse.
189180	190180	No!
190180	195300	If we ban Fosse, then women will end up just like men, and men are fucking assholes.
195300	196300	I hate men!
196300	200860	Seriously, though, some of the feminist advice given to women is borderline psychopathic.
200860	203740	You know, like, never take no for an answer.
203740	205340	Always take what you want.
205340	206340	This is like rapist advice!
206340	210020	And I get that this is an attempt to turn women into monsters so they can survive in
210020	214460	a monstrous world, but if feminism is genuine social activism instead of just individual
214460	218100	lessons in how to game the corporate shark tank to your advantage, wouldn't it be better
218100	221980	to advocate for a softer, more effeminate world where it's okay to apologize and to
221980	222980	care about other people?
222980	227140	I feel like there's a misogynistic strain in some feminism that resents femininity and
227140	228420	wants women to be more like men.
228420	230580	But I like women the way they are, goddammit!
230580	232060	We shouldn't be trying to turn women into men.
232060	235660	What we should be doing is trying to turn men into women.
235660	236660	Beautiful.
236660	237660	Perfect.
237660	238660	Angels.
238660	239660	Hairless.
239660	239660	
244460	256980	Now, if I wanted to, I could probably make an entire career out of complaining about
256980	259020	the things in feminism I don't like.
259020	262380	I'd certainly attract a larger audience and probably more money, but there are already
262380	265860	so many assholes complaining about feminism that I just can't bring myself to do it.
265860	269260	I don't want to be mistaken for one of those, and honestly I don't think it would do any
269260	270540	good for me to do that anyway.
270540	273800	You know, it's one thing when a young woman criticizes the stupid things her peers are
273800	278120	doing on Tumblr or whatever, when you've got like 49-year-old men ranting about the
278120	282600	shit 19-year-old girls are doing, I don't know, I just get kind of a creepy vibe from
282600	283600	it.
283600	286640	It reminds me of when adult men used to complain about Justin Bieber all the time.
286640	290840	Like why do you care so much what music female babies listen to anyway?
290840	294920	I still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her.
294920	299440	People with names like Sammy and Joe, Eddie and Tony, and Peggy and Guy and Patty and
299440	304160	Rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies
304160	305840	were to my palate.
305840	306840	Ah geez.
306840	310840	Now, one serious problem with junk food feminism is that it potentially distracts from more
310840	312800	substantive feminist activism.
312800	316240	But it's only a distraction to the extent you allow yourself to be distracted by it.
316240	319920	And of course the shitlords of YouTube have every interest in keeping the worst of feminism
319920	320920	in the spotlight.
320920	324520	I know to my ideological opponents it might sound weird for me to say that I'm a feminist
324520	327800	even though I believe a lot of feminism is garbage, but what you have to understand is
327800	332040	that feminism has gotten so huge and so ubiquitous that it's come to resemble the whole of human
332040	336640	life, which is to say that 95% of it is absolute fucking shit, which should come as no surprise.
336640	343120	I mean, 95% of music is shit, 95% of movies are shit, and 99.999% of YouTube videos are
343120	344120	shit.
344120	345640	The Earth itself is mostly shit.
345640	350040	It's like shitty deserts and open oceans and cold ass tundras and hot fucking mosquito
350040	354360	rainforests, and there's like plagues of locusts and dinosaurs tearing zebras apart, and the
354360	359080	whole planet is adrift in a cosmos that's 99.9% forever empty, and most of the parts
359080	361840	that aren't empty are bad and violent and shitty.
361840	365120	And all of this is really just a metaphor for the human soul, which spends most of its
365120	370400	time waiting in line, looking at the clock, in traffic, bored, anxious, envious, insecure,
370400	374800	broke, lonely, sick, hungover, aging, working, waiting for the person you have a crush on
374800	378800	to text you back and thinking they definitely hate you, 9-11, vomiting, waiting to text
378800	381480	your crush back because you don't want them to think you like them as much as you do,
381480	385400	begging for forgiveness, drying your iPhone, watching insects die because of the horrible
385400	389560	chemicals you sprayed on them, wretched, creepy, lust, longing for childhood joys that can
389560	393280	never be regained, the encroaching death of passion that slowly rots your marriage, the
393280	397740	fucking Delaware Turnpike, cancer, joyless intoxication, and whatever music it is they
397740	400200	play at fucking CVS.
400200	403440	It's all kind of a bunch of shit, which is why the meaning of life is to seek out the
403440	407400	little moments of ecstasy and redemption that make it all worthwhile, and to try each day
407400	411720	to see the world as interesting and beautiful and strange, or at least it finds it all kind
411720	412720	of funny.
412720	415440	At least, that's the best thing I've been able to come up with.
415440	419000	What's your fucking idea?
419000	422480	If you liked this video, you can follow me in the usual places, and now on Facebook too.
422480	426000	I want to thank all my new patrons for helping to make this video possible.
426000	429560	I have more ideas for videos and time or money to make them, so the more support I get, the
429560	430880	more I can do with this channel.
430880	435040	Each new pledge is a triumph for every single woman on the face of God's grey earth.
435040	435640	Namaste.
437400	438680	Namaste.
