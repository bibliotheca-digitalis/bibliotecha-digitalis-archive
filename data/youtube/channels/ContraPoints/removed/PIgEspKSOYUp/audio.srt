1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,120
all the young women out there…

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,440
Some of the more cynical feminists out there have suggested that Taylor's Grammy was

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
not so much a victory for all women as a victory for Taylor Swift, and that this version of

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,440
feminism is really just like upper-class white women congratulating themselves for how much

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,000
wealth and power they have.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,560
Now I, on the other hand…

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,560
Huh.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,160
Well, anyway, the important question is, what would a Taylor Swift song sound like covered

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
by Bob Dylan?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:45,160
I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,160
never been Till you put me down, oh I knew you were

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,160
trouble when you walked in So shame on me now, fool me to places I've

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:09,160
never been Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,960
Trouble, trouble, trouble Trouble, trouble, trouble

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
What was God thinking when he designed drugs?

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,120
He said, this one will make you alert and awake, but anxious, and you'll have to take

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,240
a shit, because fuck you.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
When people who are angry about feminism find out that I'm not angry about feminism, they

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,680
often present me with evidence of feminists doing something stupid, and then they want

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,240
to know, what do I think of that, huh?

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,520
And it's hard, because it's not easy to respond to that kind of accusation without

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,480
sounding like you're committing some kind of no-true feminist fallacy.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,520
Though it's extremely easy for any asshole with an internet connection to send you a

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,200
video of a blue-haired woman saying she hates men.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Haha!

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Feminism exposed!

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,200
But why is there so much bad feminism in the first place?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, one reason is that feminism has gotten so big in the last decade that everyone seems

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,880
to want to get in on it, leading us to a situation where much of what goes on under the heading

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
of feminism is just plain nonsense.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,920
In the current year, female mega-millionaires can draw praise for presenting their own personal

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,360
success stories as parables about the global empowerment of all womankind, and corporate

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,860
marketing has discovered that attaching heartwarming girl-power babble to a brand can attract an

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,100
extra kick of publicity from writers of feminist blogs.

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,940
If I asked you to run like a girl now, would you do it differently?

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
I would run like myself.

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Would you like a chance to redo it?

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
Yeah.

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
My god.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:38,100
I am ravenous!

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,140
I want support for ugly girls and lazy girls and girls that can't ever get their eyeliner

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
right.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,440
Well, good on them, I guess, for saying ugly girls, instead of disingenuinely insisting

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
that everyone is beautiful.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,540
You mean disingenuously, not disingenuinely, you dumb idiot!

47
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
Wretch feminists destroyed!

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,560
But should we really be celebrating laziness and incompetence?

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,160
If we support people who can't get their eyeliner right, like me in this video, how

50
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,140
are they ever supposed to learn and improve?

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,140
We need shame.

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Shame!

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Let's ban Fosse.

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
Be brave.

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
Be you.

56
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
Ban Fosse.

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
No!

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,300
If we ban Fosse, then women will end up just like men, and men are fucking assholes.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I hate men!

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,860
Seriously, though, some of the feminist advice given to women is borderline psychopathic.

61
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,740
You know, like, never take no for an answer.

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,340
Always take what you want.

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
This is like rapist advice!

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,020
And I get that this is an attempt to turn women into monsters so they can survive in

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,460
a monstrous world, but if feminism is genuine social activism instead of just individual

66
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,100
lessons in how to game the corporate shark tank to your advantage, wouldn't it be better

67
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,980
to advocate for a softer, more effeminate world where it's okay to apologize and to

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,980
care about other people?

69
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,140
I feel like there's a misogynistic strain in some feminism that resents femininity and

70
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,420
wants women to be more like men.

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580
But I like women the way they are, goddammit!

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,060
We shouldn't be trying to turn women into men.

73
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,660
What we should be doing is trying to turn men into women.

74
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,660
Beautiful.

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
Perfect.

76
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
Angels.

77
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,660
Hairless.

78
00:03:59,660 --> 00:03:59,660


79
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:16,980
Now, if I wanted to, I could probably make an entire career out of complaining about

80
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,020
the things in feminism I don't like.

81
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,380
I'd certainly attract a larger audience and probably more money, but there are already

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,860
so many assholes complaining about feminism that I just can't bring myself to do it.

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,260
I don't want to be mistaken for one of those, and honestly I don't think it would do any

84
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,540
good for me to do that anyway.

85
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,800
You know, it's one thing when a young woman criticizes the stupid things her peers are

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,120
doing on Tumblr or whatever, when you've got like 49-year-old men ranting about the

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,600
shit 19-year-old girls are doing, I don't know, I just get kind of a creepy vibe from

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
it.

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,640
It reminds me of when adult men used to complain about Justin Bieber all the time.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,840
Like why do you care so much what music female babies listen to anyway?

91
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,920
I still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,440
People with names like Sammy and Joe, Eddie and Tony, and Peggy and Guy and Patty and

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,160
Rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
were to my palate.

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Ah geez.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Now, one serious problem with junk food feminism is that it potentially distracts from more

97
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,800
substantive feminist activism.

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,240
But it's only a distraction to the extent you allow yourself to be distracted by it.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,920
And of course the shitlords of YouTube have every interest in keeping the worst of feminism

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
in the spotlight.

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,520
I know to my ideological opponents it might sound weird for me to say that I'm a feminist

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,800
even though I believe a lot of feminism is garbage, but what you have to understand is

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,040
that feminism has gotten so huge and so ubiquitous that it's come to resemble the whole of human

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,640
life, which is to say that 95% of it is absolute fucking shit, which should come as no surprise.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,120
I mean, 95% of music is shit, 95% of movies are shit, and 99.999% of YouTube videos are

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
shit.

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,640
The Earth itself is mostly shit.

108
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,040
It's like shitty deserts and open oceans and cold ass tundras and hot fucking mosquito

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,360
rainforests, and there's like plagues of locusts and dinosaurs tearing zebras apart, and the

110
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,080
whole planet is adrift in a cosmos that's 99.9% forever empty, and most of the parts

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,840
that aren't empty are bad and violent and shitty.

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
And all of this is really just a metaphor for the human soul, which spends most of its

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,400
time waiting in line, looking at the clock, in traffic, bored, anxious, envious, insecure,

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,800
broke, lonely, sick, hungover, aging, working, waiting for the person you have a crush on

115
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
to text you back and thinking they definitely hate you, 9-11, vomiting, waiting to text

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,480
your crush back because you don't want them to think you like them as much as you do,

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,400
begging for forgiveness, drying your iPhone, watching insects die because of the horrible

118
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,560
chemicals you sprayed on them, wretched, creepy, lust, longing for childhood joys that can

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,280
never be regained, the encroaching death of passion that slowly rots your marriage, the

120
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,740
fucking Delaware Turnpike, cancer, joyless intoxication, and whatever music it is they

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,200
play at fucking CVS.

122
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,440
It's all kind of a bunch of shit, which is why the meaning of life is to seek out the

123
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,400
little moments of ecstasy and redemption that make it all worthwhile, and to try each day

124
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,720
to see the world as interesting and beautiful and strange, or at least it finds it all kind

125
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
of funny.

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
At least, that's the best thing I've been able to come up with.

127
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,000
What's your fucking idea?

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,480
If you liked this video, you can follow me in the usual places, and now on Facebook too.

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,000
I want to thank all my new patrons for helping to make this video possible.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,560
I have more ideas for videos and time or money to make them, so the more support I get, the

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,880
more I can do with this channel.

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,040
Each new pledge is a triumph for every single woman on the face of God's grey earth.

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Namaste.

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
Namaste.
