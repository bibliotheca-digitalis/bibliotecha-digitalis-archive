0	5160	Last week, a transgender teenager named Milo Stewart uploaded a YouTube video titled All
5160	9000	Cis People Are Transphobic, and you're probably racist too.
9000	12000	So, what do you think happened next?
12000	15000	How did the YouTube anti-SJW community respond?
15000	20000	Well, since as a community that prides itself on its cool-headed rationality and willingness
20000	25120	to stand up for free speech, you might have expected a compassionate and measured retort.
25120	26960	But you didn't expect that, did you?
26960	28960	And neither did I.
29960	30960	Awwww.
30960	31960	Fuuuuck.
38960	43320	Milo's video inspired several mean-spirited video responses, but the one I want to focus
43320	45960	on is The Amazing Atheists.
45960	51280	Before I dig in, I should say that TJ is by no means the worst anti-SJW vlogger out there.
51280	52960	He has a kind of self-awareness about himself,
52960	55960	But hey, don't feel bad, I barely have a penis either.
55960	56960	and about his audience,
56960	59960	These brainless fucking insects that I respect,
59960	62960	and that's really lacking in certain other vloggers I could mention.
62960	66960	In his video response to Milo, TJ even seems to realize that he's too smart to be saying
66960	67960	the things he's saying.
67960	72960	He almost seems trapped, like he's a hostage who has to cater to these dum-dums in the comments.
72960	78960	And yet there he is, a grown man publicly mocking a transgender 17-year-old on the internet.
78960	84960	Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns.
84960	86960	I am oppressed!
86960	88960	Welcome to the YouTube community, Milo.
88960	90960	You're going to make a lot of friends here.
90960	92960	There's obviously a difference between criticizing and bullying,
92960	96960	but on YouTube, bullying often tries to pass itself off as critique.
96960	99960	There are a lot of claims in Milo's video that are debatable.
99960	102960	For instance, even if you are raised by open-minded people,
102960	109960	you will still be psychologically affected by living in a society built on imperialism,
109960	114960	which, by the way, created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.
114960	117960	I don't know what that means, but if you really wanted to engage with Milo,
117960	118960	you might leave a comment like,
118960	120960	That seems like an extreme claim, Milo.
120960	122960	Why do you say that all cis people are transphobic?
122960	126960	But if you look at the top comments on his video, they're not like that at all.
126960	129960	Everyone is dehumanizing him and encouraging him to kill himself.
129960	132960	You might say that everyone gets nasty comments, and that's true,
132960	137960	but on Milo's video, the nastiest, most personal, most, well, transphobic comments
137960	141960	are also the highest rated, which suggests that they're representative of the general audience.
141960	145960	Notice that these people are supposedly so angry about the accusation of being transphobic
145960	147960	that they respond by being transphobic.
147960	152960	It reminds me of the people who say that there is no rape culture that blames women for being raped,
152960	155960	and, by the way, women are to blame for being raped.
155960	157960	What else does it remind me of?
157960	160960	And this isn't even a real fucking photograph.
160960	161960	This is real, though.
161960	162960	It's so real.
162960	165960	So you say that trans people and feminists need safe spaces
165960	167960	because they're crybabies who can't handle criticism.
167960	171960	But when you look at how terribly they're actually treated in free speech zones,
171960	173960	the safe space thing starts to make sense.
173960	177960	And besides, you all have your own version of safe spaces anyway.
177960	181960	In this case, the complete circle jerk that is the comments section of anti-SJW videos.
181960	186960	I mean, just look at the difference between the ratings of SJW and anti-SJW videos.
196960	198960	Which group of people is in a fucking safe space?
198960	203960	Now I should say that there are some masochists like me who actively enjoy pain and humiliation.
206960	210960	But I'm guessing that most of you don't enjoy being publicly abused and insulted by thousands of people.
210960	213960	You predict that Milo will shut down his comments section,
213960	217960	and if he does, you'll say it's because he can't take criticism and he hates freedom of speech.
217960	220960	But how many of you anonymous cowards could sit through this kind of onslaught?
220960	223960	How many of you could have sat through it when you were fucking seventeen?
223960	226960	It's especially hard for me to watch this kind of shit go down on YouTube,
226960	231960	because I've been led to believe that the people leaving and uploading these comments are, in fact, nerds.
231960	234960	And I thought nerds were bullied and abused by assholes and jocks in high school,
234960	238960	so you'd think they'd be a little kinder to other unfairly reviled people as a result.
238960	239960	But they really aren't.
239960	243960	These nerds seem incapable of genuinely asking themselves whether they're standing up to bullies,
243960	246960	or whether they've become the bullies themselves.
246960	249960	Now I realize that Milo isn't communicating his ideas perfectly.
249960	253960	He's using the kind of SJW talking points that go over well in activist circles,
253960	256960	but don't work when your audience is deeply hostile to you from the beginning.
256960	259960	Assuming Milo doesn't retreat from the shitwave that just hit his channel,
259960	261960	he'll eventually learn that you shouldn't say things like,
261960	264960	I don't care about your cisgender feelings,
264960	268960	unless you're prepared for the locusts to descend upon you like the fucking plague of Egypt.
268960	272960	Wait a minute. Egyptian Sphinx? Isn't that kind of like Sargon of Akkad?
272960	274960	Jesus Christ, these people have disciples now.
274960	276960	I can't stand this.
276960	278960	Back to TJ's video.
278960	282960	It's not just the brainless fucking insects in his audience that are obtuse bullies.
282960	286960	TJ himself mostly misrepresents Milo's arguments so that he can spend more time on mockery.
286960	293960	The general trend now for anti-SJW channels is to berate and pwn some hapless feminist rather than to really argue.
293960	297960	Even the anti-SJW titan T.L. Deer has complained about this recently,
297960	301960	probably because he realizes it's becoming an embarrassment for the entire community he's part of.
301960	304960	The sad thing about this case is that Milo actually had a point.
304960	306960	There's some truth to the idea that everyone is racist,
306960	310960	so long as you distinguish between explicit racial hostility and implicit prejudice and bias.
310960	313960	This is a distinction that Milo himself makes.
313960	319960	Words like racist, misogynistic, and transphobic are not insults,
319960	322960	nor are they stereotypes or generalizations.
322960	327960	Rather, they are facts about the way we are socialized in a Western society.
327960	332960	Now I do agree with the anti-SJWs that leftists should abandon the stupid habit of saying
332960	338960	Western society like it's so much more evil than the progressive utopias of Russia, Uganda, and Saudi Arabia.
338960	342960	But the kid is 17 years old and trying out some new ideas. Give him a fucking break.
342960	345960	I mean, he even clarifies his view when he says
345960	350960	I talk mostly about Western societies because that is what I have the most experience with.
350960	353960	But TJ just responds with a racist caricature
353960	358960	Behead the infidel! But first, let us rape her to remind her that she is female!
358960	361960	She is a witch! She eats at a poo-poo!
361960	365960	Wait, why do people like this guy? Well, the same reason they like this guy.
365960	366960	But TJ should know better.
366960	370960	In the end, TJ has little more to offer than a misrepresentation of Milo's argument.
370960	373960	Oh, you might think to yourself, I'm not racist!
373960	379960	I treat all people as if they deserve the same rights and same human dignity.
379960	382960	Yeah, we've heard that lie before, racist!
382960	389960	As far as we're concerned, you might as well be the Klansman burning the cross and lynching the black people.
390960	394960	In a later video, maybe I'll take up the question of whether everyone has racist prejudices,
394960	397960	but I probably won't use TJ as an antagonist in that video.
397960	400960	He just doesn't have anything serious to say about the subject.
400960	404960	He could have mounted an argument against Milo's claims without attacking his gender identity
404960	409960	and getting these brainless fucking insects in my audience all worked up in a hate frenzy.
409960	413960	But instead, he's decided to appeal to the sort of person for whom a fat kid falling in the mud
413960	416960	and breaking his glasses is the height of comedy.
416960	418960	And how's that working out for him?
418960	420960	Just fucking fine.
420960	424960	And I get that part of the fun of YouTube is watching personalities clash.
424960	427960	I'm not saying that vlogs should be perfectly calm and rational.
427960	431960	It's one thing when a belligerent asshole like me attacks another belligerent asshole like TJ.
431960	434960	But when a belligerent asshole with hundreds of thousands of subscribers
434960	437960	attacks an earnest teenager half his age and with a fraction of his audience,
437960	441960	thereby inundating the small channel with a swarm of brainless fucking insects
441960	444960	who are there not to engage or contribute, but to bully and torment,
444960	446960	well, it's just kind of-
452960	456960	If you liked this video, please validate my self-worth by subscribing and upvoting it.
456960	458960	It's the only thing keeping me going.
458960	460960	Besides the booze.
474960	476960	Would you fuck me?
476960	478960	I'd fuck me.
