00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Last week, a transgender teenager named Milo Stewart uploaded a YouTube video titled All

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,000
Cis People Are Transphobic, and you're probably racist too.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, what do you think happened next?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How did the YouTube anti-SJW community respond?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, since as a community that prides itself on its cool-headed rationality and willingness

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,120
to stand up for free speech, you might have expected a compassionate and measured retort.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,960
But you didn't expect that, did you?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
And neither did I.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Awwww.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Fuuuuck.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,320
Milo's video inspired several mean-spirited video responses, but the one I want to focus

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,960
on is The Amazing Atheists.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,280
Before I dig in, I should say that TJ is by no means the worst anti-SJW vlogger out there.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
He has a kind of self-awareness about himself,

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
But hey, don't feel bad, I barely have a penis either.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
and about his audience,

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,960
These brainless fucking insects that I respect,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,960
and that's really lacking in certain other vloggers I could mention.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
In his video response to Milo, TJ even seems to realize that he's too smart to be saying

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
the things he's saying.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,960
He almost seems trapped, like he's a hostage who has to cater to these dum-dums in the comments.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,960
And yet there he is, a grown man publicly mocking a transgender 17-year-old on the internet.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Hey guys, I may appear female, but I am in fact a non-binary trans person who prefers male pronouns.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I am oppressed!

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Welcome to the YouTube community, Milo.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
You're going to make a lot of friends here.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
There's obviously a difference between criticizing and bullying,

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
but on YouTube, bullying often tries to pass itself off as critique.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,960
There are a lot of claims in Milo's video that are debatable.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
For instance, even if you are raised by open-minded people,

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,960
you will still be psychologically affected by living in a society built on imperialism,

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,960
which, by the way, created cisnormativity and heteronormativity.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
I don't know what that means, but if you really wanted to engage with Milo,

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
you might leave a comment like,

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
That seems like an extreme claim, Milo.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Why do you say that all cis people are transphobic?

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
But if you look at the top comments on his video, they're not like that at all.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Everyone is dehumanizing him and encouraging him to kill himself.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,960
You might say that everyone gets nasty comments, and that's true,

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,960
but on Milo's video, the nastiest, most personal, most, well, transphobic comments

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,960
are also the highest rated, which suggests that they're representative of the general audience.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Notice that these people are supposedly so angry about the accusation of being transphobic

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
that they respond by being transphobic.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,960
It reminds me of the people who say that there is no rape culture that blames women for being raped,

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,960
and, by the way, women are to blame for being raped.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
What else does it remind me of?

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,960
And this isn't even a real fucking photograph.

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
This is real, though.

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
It's so real.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
So you say that trans people and feminists need safe spaces

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
because they're crybabies who can't handle criticism.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,960
But when you look at how terribly they're actually treated in free speech zones,

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
the safe space thing starts to make sense.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
And besides, you all have your own version of safe spaces anyway.

55
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,960
In this case, the complete circle jerk that is the comments section of anti-SJW videos.

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I mean, just look at the difference between the ratings of SJW and anti-SJW videos.

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Which group of people is in a fucking safe space?

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Now I should say that there are some masochists like me who actively enjoy pain and humiliation.

59
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,960
But I'm guessing that most of you don't enjoy being publicly abused and insulted by thousands of people.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,960
You predict that Milo will shut down his comments section,

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,960
and if he does, you'll say it's because he can't take criticism and he hates freedom of speech.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
But how many of you anonymous cowards could sit through this kind of onslaught?

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,960
How many of you could have sat through it when you were fucking seventeen?

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
It's especially hard for me to watch this kind of shit go down on YouTube,

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,960
because I've been led to believe that the people leaving and uploading these comments are, in fact, nerds.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
And I thought nerds were bullied and abused by assholes and jocks in high school,

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,960
so you'd think they'd be a little kinder to other unfairly reviled people as a result.

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
But they really aren't.

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,960
These nerds seem incapable of genuinely asking themselves whether they're standing up to bullies,

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,960
or whether they've become the bullies themselves.

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Now I realize that Milo isn't communicating his ideas perfectly.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,960
He's using the kind of SJW talking points that go over well in activist circles,

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
but don't work when your audience is deeply hostile to you from the beginning.

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Assuming Milo doesn't retreat from the shitwave that just hit his channel,

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
he'll eventually learn that you shouldn't say things like,

76
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I don't care about your cisgender feelings,

77
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
unless you're prepared for the locusts to descend upon you like the fucking plague of Egypt.

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Wait a minute. Egyptian Sphinx? Isn't that kind of like Sargon of Akkad?

79
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Jesus Christ, these people have disciples now.

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I can't stand this.

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Back to TJ's video.

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
It's not just the brainless fucking insects in his audience that are obtuse bullies.

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
TJ himself mostly misrepresents Milo's arguments so that he can spend more time on mockery.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,960
The general trend now for anti-SJW channels is to berate and pwn some hapless feminist rather than to really argue.

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Even the anti-SJW titan T.L. Deer has complained about this recently,

86
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,960
probably because he realizes it's becoming an embarrassment for the entire community he's part of.

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,960
The sad thing about this case is that Milo actually had a point.

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
There's some truth to the idea that everyone is racist,

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
so long as you distinguish between explicit racial hostility and implicit prejudice and bias.

90
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
This is a distinction that Milo himself makes.

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Words like racist, misogynistic, and transphobic are not insults,

92
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
nor are they stereotypes or generalizations.

93
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Rather, they are facts about the way we are socialized in a Western society.

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Now I do agree with the anti-SJWs that leftists should abandon the stupid habit of saying

95
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Western society like it's so much more evil than the progressive utopias of Russia, Uganda, and Saudi Arabia.

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
But the kid is 17 years old and trying out some new ideas. Give him a fucking break.

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I mean, he even clarifies his view when he says

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I talk mostly about Western societies because that is what I have the most experience with.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
But TJ just responds with a racist caricature

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Behead the infidel! But first, let us rape her to remind her that she is female!

101
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
She is a witch! She eats at a poo-poo!

102
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Wait, why do people like this guy? Well, the same reason they like this guy.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
But TJ should know better.

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
In the end, TJ has little more to offer than a misrepresentation of Milo's argument.

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Oh, you might think to yourself, I'm not racist!

106
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I treat all people as if they deserve the same rights and same human dignity.

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Yeah, we've heard that lie before, racist!

108
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,960
As far as we're concerned, you might as well be the Klansman burning the cross and lynching the black people.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
In a later video, maybe I'll take up the question of whether everyone has racist prejudices,

110
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,960
but I probably won't use TJ as an antagonist in that video.

111
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,960
He just doesn't have anything serious to say about the subject.

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
He could have mounted an argument against Milo's claims without attacking his gender identity

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,960
and getting these brainless fucking insects in my audience all worked up in a hate frenzy.

114
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,960
But instead, he's decided to appeal to the sort of person for whom a fat kid falling in the mud

115
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,960
and breaking his glasses is the height of comedy.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
And how's that working out for him?

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Just fucking fine.

118
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,960
And I get that part of the fun of YouTube is watching personalities clash.

119
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm not saying that vlogs should be perfectly calm and rational.

120
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,960
It's one thing when a belligerent asshole like me attacks another belligerent asshole like TJ.

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,960
But when a belligerent asshole with hundreds of thousands of subscribers

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
attacks an earnest teenager half his age and with a fraction of his audience,

123
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,960
thereby inundating the small channel with a swarm of brainless fucking insects

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
who are there not to engage or contribute, but to bully and torment,

125
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
well, it's just kind of-

126
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,960
If you liked this video, please validate my self-worth by subscribing and upvoting it.

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
It's the only thing keeping me going.

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Besides the booze.

129
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Would you fuck me?

130
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
I'd fuck me.
