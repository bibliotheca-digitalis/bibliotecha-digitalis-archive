0	4440	There's nothing like starting a new game of childhood to make me feel like a Pok√©mon
4440	5440	again.
5440	6440	Huh.
6440	7880	No option to play as a female character.
7880	9560	Wait, is that sexist?
9560	10560	Is this patriarchy?
10560	12080	Is this a trope versus women?
12080	13080	No!
13080	14080	Not here!
14080	15080	Not in my childhood!
15080	16080	I need a-
16080	17080	Get out of my childhood!
17080	19080	Oh god, I'm sorry.
19080	24520	Forgive me, sweet mother, dark mother, cold mother, kind mother, cruel mother.
24520	26320	Baby, I'm sorry.
30000	46800	I don't like arguing about feminism itself, because no one agrees what feminism means,
46800	50200	and if you call yourself a feminist you're vulnerable to what we might call the Trigglypuff
50200	54400	argument, where your opponent says, look at this dumb retarded feminist, and you end up
54400	58480	feeling like you have to apologize for something you never agreed with in the first place.
58480	62760	So let's just skip the debate about what feminism means, and about who is or isn't a feminist.
62760	66440	The important thing are the substantive issues, and one of the big ones is rape culture.
66440	67640	So let's start with that.
67640	71120	In the shitlord corners of YouTube, the consensus seems to be that there is such a thing as
71120	74960	a rape culture, but that it's only the province of Muslims and the blacks.
74960	77160	Sargon in particular has made this claim several times.
77160	80840	While I certainly agree that there are rape cultures in African and Muslim societies,
80840	83280	I don't think that we in the West are entirely off the hook.
83280	86680	I also think it's more important for us to establish whether or not there is a rape culture
86680	90560	in our own societies than it is to protest on behalf of people living in Africa, simply
90560	93960	because we have more influence over our own cultures than we do over what people are doing
93960	95260	in the Congo.
95260	98920	This is also my response to people who say, why are feminists complaining about first
98920	101800	world problems when there's still female genital mutilation in Egypt?
101800	105840	Well, if I could press a button and end female genital mutilation in Egypt, then I would.
105840	109000	But the truth is that I have no influence whatsoever over cultural traditions in North
109000	112480	Africa, whereas I do at least have a small influence over the people in my immediate
112480	113480	vicinity.
113480	116560	So if it turns out that there is a rape culture in America, then that has more of a moral
116600	119000	pull on me than whatever it is that people are doing in Somalia.
119000	122320	And to be clear, I'm not saying that you shouldn't care about female genital mutilation.
122320	125520	I agree that it's important to be an informed global citizen and all that shit.
125520	128480	I'm just saying that you have more influence and therefore more responsibility within your
128480	129480	own society.
129480	132320	So the question I'm addressing is whether there's a rape culture in Western society.
132320	137200	But this is actually a pretty bad way of framing the issue, since Western society is an extremely
137200	138340	vague term.
138340	139840	What counts as Western society?
139840	140920	Does Moldova count?
140920	141920	Does Australia?
141920	142960	Does Mexico?
143040	146600	But even if we restrict the topic to just one country, it remains unclear what it would
146600	150040	mean to say that, for example, American culture is a rape culture.
150040	151040	What is American culture?
151040	153040	Are we talking about hip hop culture?
153040	154380	Appalachian culture?
154380	155660	Juggalo culture?
155660	156660	This gets pretty complicated.
156660	158780	It's like doing my goddamn taxes.
158780	164160	The standard deduction must be prorated using the Maryland income factor.
164160	167780	Prorate the standard deduction using the following formula.
167780	173340	Standard deduction times Maryland income factor equals prorated standard deduction.
173340	175740	What the fuck is the Maryland income factor?
175740	176940	God damn it!
176940	179520	What do feminists mean when they say we live in a rape culture?
179520	180520	Who are we?
180520	181520	What is culture?
181520	182520	What is is?
182520	183520	Enlighten us, Socrates!
183520	186460	All of us will die before these questions are answered, so I'm going to push ahead with
186460	188940	a warning that clarifications might be necessary.
188940	192660	The phrase rape culture describes an environment where rape is normalized and justified and
192660	194700	where rape victims are shamed and blamed.
194900	198580	Certainly this accurately describes the culture of Congolese warlords and Homeric heroes,
198580	202420	but in a different way it also pertains to societies that do not openly endorse rape.
202420	206140	A common argument against the idea of first world rape culture has it that because rape
206140	210340	is illegal and because rape among crimes is reviled almost uniquely, there is no way that
210340	213900	say American society could be accurately described as a rape culture.
213900	216780	But of course there are also laws against drugs, and we're all taught that drugs are
216780	219580	bad in school, yet still there exists a drug culture.
219580	220900	Not that I know anything about drug culture.
220900	222420	I've read a couple articles about it.
222420	226820	One took over the line, sweet Jesus, one took over the line.
226820	227820	Shh!
227820	230340	Part of what's going on here is that our culture is in conflict.
230340	233540	On the one hand, there's our education and the law telling us that drugs are bad, and
233540	236820	on the other hand there's the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industries telling us that
236820	241300	drugs are the solution to anxiety and sadness, and on the third hand, there's the goddamn
241300	244660	media that glamorizes partying and hedonism.
244660	245660	As it should.
245660	248940	Those things are glamorous and fun.
248940	250300	Something similar is going on with rape.
250540	254500	On the one hand, we view rape as this crime to end all crimes, this abomination so fathomless
254500	256660	and evil that we dare not even joke about it.
256660	257660	And on the other hand...
263340	266580	There's almost an air of protesting too much about our hatred of rape.
266580	268980	It reminds me of our collective attitude toward pedophilia.
268980	273100	Overtly, we hate it so intensely that there are actually vigilante gangs of pedophile
273100	276940	hunters in reality TV shows dedicated to persecuting potential offenders.
277180	281260	At the same time, we fetishize youth and even childhood to such an extent that the explicit
281260	284460	disdain we hold towards pedophiles almost amounts to a kind of doublethink.
284460	287460	Likewise, I think our society is essentially conflicted about rape.
287460	290860	I also think that, far from being knocked down proof that there is no rape culture,
290860	295060	the exaggerated horror we reserve for an extreme idea of rape actually helps to provide cover
295060	296820	for more common everyday rape.
296820	300060	If rape is the worst of crimes and rapists are monsters, then why don't we feel like
300060	304500	we're looking at abject evil when confronted with an actual rapist, like, say, Brock Turner
304500	306060	of Stanford Dumpster fame?
306140	309980	Well, probably it's because fingering an unconscious woman for a few minutes is not the worst crime
309980	313500	humans are capable of, and Brock Turner is probably not a total monster.
313500	316940	In fact, if you're an upper-middle-class Stanford alum like the judge who sentenced
316940	320660	him to six months in county jail, he might even seem relatable and sympathetic.
320660	324180	But what Brock did still is rape, and it is illegal and immoral.
324180	328020	His crime just wasn't some kind of especially heinous law-and-order SVU-type situation.
328020	331940	So Christina buys him breakfast, he rapes her for lunch.
332900	336380	So there's a mismatch about what we say we think about rape and what we actually think.
336380	340060	The idea that psychopathy or some inherent and incorrigible moral defect is what leads
340060	343700	men to rape also supports the argument that teaching men not to rape is a hare-brained
343700	345380	feminist pipe dream.
345380	347940	Rapists know that rape is wrong, the argument goes.
347940	350140	You can't teach thieves not to steal.
350140	354100	Put your hands up if you have a lock on your front door.
354100	355100	Why do you do that?
355100	356100	Why do you put a lock-
356100	357100	Don't you even start.
357100	360980	Look, everyone agrees that the sentence rape is wrong is true because the word rape is
361060	362940	loaded with negative moral value.
362940	366420	The problem is not that rapists don't accept the truth of the proposition rape is wrong,
366420	369540	it's that they don't even think of their behavior as rape in the first place.
369540	373220	The people who argue that rapists know that rape is wrong have a bad theory about the
373220	374740	psychology of rapists.
374740	376460	In Brock Turner's statement in court, he said,
382700	386060	The same Broadly article that quote is from also quotes the vice president of the European
386060	387620	Men's Health Forum, who says,
390980	395180	Instead, the phrase you constantly hear them say is,
395180	396780	I thought she wanted it too.
396780	400620	A few years ago, there was an Ask a Rapist thread on Reddit, where rapists and people
400620	403380	who had almost committed rape shared their side of the story.
403380	405940	Very few of the rapists claimed to have been thinking at the time,
405940	410340	I know that rape is wrong, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I'm so evil.
410340	413460	Much more common is, that's when I thought she must have wanted it.
413460	415860	There's also a lot of rationalizing and justifying.
415860	419420	The men can't control themselves theory is very popular with rapists.
419420	422540	An erect penis has no conscience, as one rapist puts it.
422540	425740	And actually that's true, but you are not a slave to your penis, sir.
425740	429220	Blaming alcohol is also popular, which I take personal offense to since I've been drunk
429220	431300	since 2008 and I never raped anyone.
431300	434900	Now there are some exceptions to the rule that American rape culture is subtle.
434900	438180	Some fraternities have straight-up Mycenaean rape cultures that would make any ISIS rape
438180	439180	lord proud.
439180	442940	A few years ago, a Phi Kappa Tau member at Georgia Tech sent an email to his chapter
442940	448380	titled Luring Your Rape Bait, in which he describes a simple seven-step system for weaponizing
448380	452540	alcohol to coerce girls into sex, ejaculate inside of them, and shove them out of your
452540	453540	room.
453540	458340	Of course, the email also says, no raping, in all caps, so I guess it's not really rape.
458340	459340	There is no rape culture.
459340	460340	Case closed.
460340	463740	My theory about fraternity rape culture is that it begins with sadomasochistic hazing
463740	467420	rituals and just generally doing gay rapey shit to people who are unconscious.
467420	471020	This creates an atmosphere of disrespect for consent and bodily autonomy, which is propped
471020	474900	up by an ideology of male bonding, and comes to seem harmless and normal.
474900	478300	Then when women stumble into the lair, they're treated with the same lack of respect, mind
478300	482900	us the male bonding, and plus misogyny and social pressure to get laid by any means necessary,
482900	483900	and the result is rape.
483900	487940	Now, the existence of fraternity rape culture doesn't prove that America is a rape culture,
487940	490260	but that's not exactly what I'm trying to prove.
490260	494300	My point is that there are significant segments of American society that implicitly or explicitly
494300	495580	encourage rape.
495580	499100	The feminist blogosphere is part of American culture, but I don't think any feminist would
499100	500820	want to say that it's part of rape culture.
500820	504460	A corollary of this is that rape could probably be somewhat reduced by opposing these rapey
504460	506260	elements in American society.
506260	507700	There's an argument that goes,
527820	530900	While this might be strictly speaking true, I don't think it's the case that rape can't
530900	531900	be reduced.
531900	532900	How could it be reduced?
532900	535940	Well, for one, shut down the institutions that support rape culture.
535940	539020	Close down frat chapters that encourage or permit their members to rape.
539020	541100	Make consent a big part of sex education.
541100	545340	I know that shitlords argue we already teach men not to rape and no more education is necessary.
545340	548460	Telling women to stay home, to not drink, and to dress like nuns is the only option
548460	549620	we have, they say.
549620	554300	But I for one never really encountered a sophisticated discussion about consent until age 22, when
554300	557340	I received my cultural Marxist brainwashing from academic feminism.
557340	560660	In high school sex ed, I learned that abstinence is the only safe option.
560660	563620	I gave a class presentation on scabies, and that was about it.
563620	566980	There was nothing about determining whether someone is too intoxicated to consent or what
566980	570980	coercion looks like, though these topics are kind of complicated and, to a lot of people,
570980	572380	apparently not obvious.
572380	575700	Kids receive mixed messages about it from their peers, and so yes, I think good education
575700	577100	on the subject would in fact help.
577100	579740	And I don't think parents are doing an adequate job either.
579740	583100	Brock Turner's dad still can't really face the fact that his son is a rapist even after
583100	584160	he was convicted.
584160	587300	Most parents understandably don't want to believe that their child is capable of raping
587300	588300	someone.
588300	591820	This is another area where our idea of rapists as inhuman monsters actually gets in the way
591820	592820	of preventing rape.
592820	595860	The Brock Turner case is interesting because it illustrates some of the ways that there
595860	599740	are still remnants of rape culture in America, but it also illustrates how things have changed
599740	600860	for the better.
600860	604140	On the one hand, there is the tendency of the media, and for that matter the judge,
604140	608300	to sympathize with the rapist, to downplay his crimes, and to lament the ruined opportunities
608300	610940	that will result from the tragedy of his having raped someone.
610940	613660	On the other hand, Brock has been widely vilified on the internet.
613660	617020	His comparatively lenient sentence has been met with outrage, and the Vice President of
617020	619820	the United States has publicly declared his victim a hero.
619820	623140	This is the opposite of what we would expect from a rape culture, and it indicates that
623140	625140	major progress has been made on this issue.
625140	627740	I say progress because things used to be a lot worse.
627740	631860	I wasn't around in the 1960s, but I think that art and media history tell a pretty compelling
631860	632860	story.
632860	636540	Look at this scene from Goldfinger where the hero James Bond rapes Pussy Galore until her
636540	637700	body says yes.
637700	638700	Skip it.
638700	639700	I'm not interested.
639700	640700	Let's go.
640700	645380	What would it take for you to see things my way?
645380	648060	A lot more than you've got.
648060	649300	How do you know?
649300	653580	I don't want to know.
653580	657300	Isn't it customary to grant the condemned man his last request?
657300	660660	You've asked for this.
660660	664980	I'm going to skip the next 30 seconds of hilarious pre-rape jiu-jitsu.
664980	665980	Ah.
665980	675700	Now let's both play.
675700	684580	It's not rape if romantic orchestral music swells in the background.
684580	687660	It's pretty hard to imagine a script with a scene like that in it getting picked up
687660	688660	today.
688660	691900	But this sort of thing does still have its apologists, like in this video where professional
691900	696580	dating coach Adam Lyons teaches you to get girls like James Bond by being persistent
696580	698740	and not getting discouraged by resistance.
698740	702580	I'm not going to take no for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner.
702580	707500	And winners, we don't listen to words like no or don't or stop.
707500	709460	Those words are just not in our vocabulary.
709460	710460	I know what you need.
710460	712540	And Adam Lyons knows what he's talking about.
712540	716500	Once voted least likely to get a girlfriend at school, he's internationally regarded as
716500	718940	one of the top three specialists on seduction.
718940	719940	I'm sold.
719940	723220	I think we're at a point where most of us find this unacceptable, but it's worth asking
723220	724960	why this progress has occurred.
724960	728260	I think a big part of it is that feminists have been complaining about this for literally
728260	731880	decades, and a lot of people, especially in media and academia, have finally listened
731880	732880	to them.
732880	735840	Sometimes to get things done you just have to complain for 40 or 50 years, and it's
735840	738600	not fun, and it sucks to listen to, but you just have to do it.
738600	742240	Eventually the culture changes, and then everyone pretends they were on your side all along,
742240	745640	as happened with gay rights and is currently happening with trans acceptance, and, I'm
745640	747920	happy to report, with opposition to rape culture.
747920	750920	The exception, of course, are the millions of troglodytes on YouTube still clinging to
750920	753280	justifiably outdated notions about sex and gender.
753280	756120	I'm not saying that everything feminism does is good, but that there isn't room
756120	759540	for justified critique, since even the most righteous social movements usually come with
759540	761080	us mattering of bad ideas.
761080	762080	No one is perfect.
762080	765280	Martin Luther King cheated on his wife and plagiarized his doctoral dissertation.
765280	769100	And if Thunderf00t and Sargon had been around in 1964, they probably would have been writing
769100	771240	articles decrying him as a cheater and a fraud.
771240	774280	They're just a couple of rational freethinkers pointing out the facts.
774280	778280	Fortunately, the bad ideas seem to fade out after a while, while the good ideas tend to
778280	779280	stick.
779280	782760	In the 1970s it was a popular talking point for the women's movement that PMS is a fiction
782760	784360	of patriarchal psychiatry.
784360	787760	This bad idea has vanished, while the good idea that women ought to have equal employment
787760	789160	opportunity has persisted.
789160	791960	So it's not that there's anything wrong with critiquing the weak ideas of social
791960	792960	justice movements.
792960	795960	I mean, that's probably what I'd be doing myself if YouTube weren't so inundated
795960	798240	with bullying shitlord response channel bullshit.
798240	803200	What I strongly oppose is this position that feminism is cancer, and feminism is the enemy,
803200	805080	and feminism poisons everything.
805080	808000	This is just reactionary and indefensible.
808000	814440	If you liked this video, please like, subscribe, and PM me your nudes.
814440	818120	It's alright, I'm a man on the internet who makes videos about rape.
818120	819120	What could be safer than that?
