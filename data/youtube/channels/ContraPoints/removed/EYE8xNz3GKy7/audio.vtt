00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
There's nothing like starting a new game of childhood to make me feel like a PokÃ©mon

00:04.440 --> 00:05.440
again.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.440
Huh.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.880
No option to play as a female character.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.560
Wait, is that sexist?

00:09.560 --> 00:10.560
Is this patriarchy?

00:10.560 --> 00:12.080
Is this a trope versus women?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.080
No!

00:13.080 --> 00:14.080
Not here!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.080
Not in my childhood!

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
I need a-

00:16.080 --> 00:17.080
Get out of my childhood!

00:17.080 --> 00:19.080
Oh god, I'm sorry.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.520
Forgive me, sweet mother, dark mother, cold mother, kind mother, cruel mother.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.320
Baby, I'm sorry.

00:30.000 --> 00:46.800
I don't like arguing about feminism itself, because no one agrees what feminism means,

00:46.800 --> 00:50.200
and if you call yourself a feminist you're vulnerable to what we might call the Trigglypuff

00:50.200 --> 00:54.400
argument, where your opponent says, look at this dumb retarded feminist, and you end up

00:54.400 --> 00:58.480
feeling like you have to apologize for something you never agreed with in the first place.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.760
So let's just skip the debate about what feminism means, and about who is or isn't a feminist.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.440
The important thing are the substantive issues, and one of the big ones is rape culture.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.640
So let's start with that.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.120
In the shitlord corners of YouTube, the consensus seems to be that there is such a thing as

01:11.120 --> 01:14.960
a rape culture, but that it's only the province of Muslims and the blacks.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.160
Sargon in particular has made this claim several times.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.840
While I certainly agree that there are rape cultures in African and Muslim societies,

01:20.840 --> 01:23.280
I don't think that we in the West are entirely off the hook.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.680
I also think it's more important for us to establish whether or not there is a rape culture

01:26.680 --> 01:30.560
in our own societies than it is to protest on behalf of people living in Africa, simply

01:30.560 --> 01:33.960
because we have more influence over our own cultures than we do over what people are doing

01:33.960 --> 01:35.260
in the Congo.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.920
This is also my response to people who say, why are feminists complaining about first

01:38.920 --> 01:41.800
world problems when there's still female genital mutilation in Egypt?

01:41.800 --> 01:45.840
Well, if I could press a button and end female genital mutilation in Egypt, then I would.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.000
But the truth is that I have no influence whatsoever over cultural traditions in North

01:49.000 --> 01:52.480
Africa, whereas I do at least have a small influence over the people in my immediate

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
vicinity.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.560
So if it turns out that there is a rape culture in America, then that has more of a moral

01:56.600 --> 01:59.000
pull on me than whatever it is that people are doing in Somalia.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.320
And to be clear, I'm not saying that you shouldn't care about female genital mutilation.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.520
I agree that it's important to be an informed global citizen and all that shit.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.480
I'm just saying that you have more influence and therefore more responsibility within your

02:08.480 --> 02:09.480
own society.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.320
So the question I'm addressing is whether there's a rape culture in Western society.

02:12.320 --> 02:17.200
But this is actually a pretty bad way of framing the issue, since Western society is an extremely

02:17.200 --> 02:18.340
vague term.

02:18.340 --> 02:19.840
What counts as Western society?

02:19.840 --> 02:20.920
Does Moldova count?

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
Does Australia?

02:21.920 --> 02:22.960
Does Mexico?

02:23.040 --> 02:26.600
But even if we restrict the topic to just one country, it remains unclear what it would

02:26.600 --> 02:30.040
mean to say that, for example, American culture is a rape culture.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.040
What is American culture?

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
Are we talking about hip hop culture?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.380
Appalachian culture?

02:34.380 --> 02:35.660
Juggalo culture?

02:35.660 --> 02:36.660
This gets pretty complicated.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.780
It's like doing my goddamn taxes.

02:38.780 --> 02:44.160
The standard deduction must be prorated using the Maryland income factor.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.780
Prorate the standard deduction using the following formula.

02:47.780 --> 02:53.340
Standard deduction times Maryland income factor equals prorated standard deduction.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.740
What the fuck is the Maryland income factor?

02:55.740 --> 02:56.940
God damn it!

02:56.940 --> 02:59.520
What do feminists mean when they say we live in a rape culture?

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Who are we?

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
What is culture?

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
What is is?

03:02.520 --> 03:03.520
Enlighten us, Socrates!

03:03.520 --> 03:06.460
All of us will die before these questions are answered, so I'm going to push ahead with

03:06.460 --> 03:08.940
a warning that clarifications might be necessary.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.660
The phrase rape culture describes an environment where rape is normalized and justified and

03:12.660 --> 03:14.700
where rape victims are shamed and blamed.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.580
Certainly this accurately describes the culture of Congolese warlords and Homeric heroes,

03:18.580 --> 03:22.420
but in a different way it also pertains to societies that do not openly endorse rape.

03:22.420 --> 03:26.140
A common argument against the idea of first world rape culture has it that because rape

03:26.140 --> 03:30.340
is illegal and because rape among crimes is reviled almost uniquely, there is no way that

03:30.340 --> 03:33.900
say American society could be accurately described as a rape culture.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.780
But of course there are also laws against drugs, and we're all taught that drugs are

03:36.780 --> 03:39.580
bad in school, yet still there exists a drug culture.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.900
Not that I know anything about drug culture.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.420
I've read a couple articles about it.

03:42.420 --> 03:46.820
One took over the line, sweet Jesus, one took over the line.

03:46.820 --> 03:47.820
Shh!

03:47.820 --> 03:50.340
Part of what's going on here is that our culture is in conflict.

03:50.340 --> 03:53.540
On the one hand, there's our education and the law telling us that drugs are bad, and

03:53.540 --> 03:56.820
on the other hand there's the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industries telling us that

03:56.820 --> 04:01.300
drugs are the solution to anxiety and sadness, and on the third hand, there's the goddamn

04:01.300 --> 04:04.660
media that glamorizes partying and hedonism.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.660
As it should.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.940
Those things are glamorous and fun.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.300
Something similar is going on with rape.

04:10.540 --> 04:14.500
On the one hand, we view rape as this crime to end all crimes, this abomination so fathomless

04:14.500 --> 04:16.660
and evil that we dare not even joke about it.

04:16.660 --> 04:17.660
And on the other hand...

04:23.340 --> 04:26.580
There's almost an air of protesting too much about our hatred of rape.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.980
It reminds me of our collective attitude toward pedophilia.

04:28.980 --> 04:33.100
Overtly, we hate it so intensely that there are actually vigilante gangs of pedophile

04:33.100 --> 04:36.940
hunters in reality TV shows dedicated to persecuting potential offenders.

04:37.180 --> 04:41.260
At the same time, we fetishize youth and even childhood to such an extent that the explicit

04:41.260 --> 04:44.460
disdain we hold towards pedophiles almost amounts to a kind of doublethink.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.460
Likewise, I think our society is essentially conflicted about rape.

04:47.460 --> 04:50.860
I also think that, far from being knocked down proof that there is no rape culture,

04:50.860 --> 04:55.060
the exaggerated horror we reserve for an extreme idea of rape actually helps to provide cover

04:55.060 --> 04:56.820
for more common everyday rape.

04:56.820 --> 05:00.060
If rape is the worst of crimes and rapists are monsters, then why don't we feel like

05:00.060 --> 05:04.500
we're looking at abject evil when confronted with an actual rapist, like, say, Brock Turner

05:04.500 --> 05:06.060
of Stanford Dumpster fame?

05:06.140 --> 05:09.980
Well, probably it's because fingering an unconscious woman for a few minutes is not the worst crime

05:09.980 --> 05:13.500
humans are capable of, and Brock Turner is probably not a total monster.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.940
In fact, if you're an upper-middle-class Stanford alum like the judge who sentenced

05:16.940 --> 05:20.660
him to six months in county jail, he might even seem relatable and sympathetic.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.180
But what Brock did still is rape, and it is illegal and immoral.

05:24.180 --> 05:28.020
His crime just wasn't some kind of especially heinous law-and-order SVU-type situation.

05:28.020 --> 05:31.940
So Christina buys him breakfast, he rapes her for lunch.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.380
So there's a mismatch about what we say we think about rape and what we actually think.

05:36.380 --> 05:40.060
The idea that psychopathy or some inherent and incorrigible moral defect is what leads

05:40.060 --> 05:43.700
men to rape also supports the argument that teaching men not to rape is a hare-brained

05:43.700 --> 05:45.380
feminist pipe dream.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.940
Rapists know that rape is wrong, the argument goes.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.140
You can't teach thieves not to steal.

05:50.140 --> 05:54.100
Put your hands up if you have a lock on your front door.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
Why do you do that?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
Why do you put a lock-

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
Don't you even start.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.980
Look, everyone agrees that the sentence rape is wrong is true because the word rape is

06:01.060 --> 06:02.940
loaded with negative moral value.

06:02.940 --> 06:06.420
The problem is not that rapists don't accept the truth of the proposition rape is wrong,

06:06.420 --> 06:09.540
it's that they don't even think of their behavior as rape in the first place.

06:09.540 --> 06:13.220
The people who argue that rapists know that rape is wrong have a bad theory about the

06:13.220 --> 06:14.740
psychology of rapists.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.460
In Brock Turner's statement in court, he said,

06:22.700 --> 06:26.060
The same Broadly article that quote is from also quotes the vice president of the European

06:26.060 --> 06:27.620
Men's Health Forum, who says,

06:30.980 --> 06:35.180
Instead, the phrase you constantly hear them say is,

06:35.180 --> 06:36.780
I thought she wanted it too.

06:36.780 --> 06:40.620
A few years ago, there was an Ask a Rapist thread on Reddit, where rapists and people

06:40.620 --> 06:43.380
who had almost committed rape shared their side of the story.

06:43.380 --> 06:45.940
Very few of the rapists claimed to have been thinking at the time,

06:45.940 --> 06:50.340
I know that rape is wrong, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I'm so evil.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.460
Much more common is, that's when I thought she must have wanted it.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.860
There's also a lot of rationalizing and justifying.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.420
The men can't control themselves theory is very popular with rapists.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.540
An erect penis has no conscience, as one rapist puts it.

07:02.540 --> 07:05.740
And actually that's true, but you are not a slave to your penis, sir.

07:05.740 --> 07:09.220
Blaming alcohol is also popular, which I take personal offense to since I've been drunk

07:09.220 --> 07:11.300
since 2008 and I never raped anyone.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.900
Now there are some exceptions to the rule that American rape culture is subtle.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.180
Some fraternities have straight-up Mycenaean rape cultures that would make any ISIS rape

07:18.180 --> 07:19.180
lord proud.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.940
A few years ago, a Phi Kappa Tau member at Georgia Tech sent an email to his chapter

07:22.940 --> 07:28.380
titled Luring Your Rape Bait, in which he describes a simple seven-step system for weaponizing

07:28.380 --> 07:32.540
alcohol to coerce girls into sex, ejaculate inside of them, and shove them out of your

07:32.540 --> 07:33.540
room.

07:33.540 --> 07:38.340
Of course, the email also says, no raping, in all caps, so I guess it's not really rape.

07:38.340 --> 07:39.340
There is no rape culture.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.340
Case closed.

07:40.340 --> 07:43.740
My theory about fraternity rape culture is that it begins with sadomasochistic hazing

07:43.740 --> 07:47.420
rituals and just generally doing gay rapey shit to people who are unconscious.

07:47.420 --> 07:51.020
This creates an atmosphere of disrespect for consent and bodily autonomy, which is propped

07:51.020 --> 07:54.900
up by an ideology of male bonding, and comes to seem harmless and normal.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.300
Then when women stumble into the lair, they're treated with the same lack of respect, mind

07:58.300 --> 08:02.900
us the male bonding, and plus misogyny and social pressure to get laid by any means necessary,

08:02.900 --> 08:03.900
and the result is rape.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.940
Now, the existence of fraternity rape culture doesn't prove that America is a rape culture,

08:07.940 --> 08:10.260
but that's not exactly what I'm trying to prove.

08:10.260 --> 08:14.300
My point is that there are significant segments of American society that implicitly or explicitly

08:14.300 --> 08:15.580
encourage rape.

08:15.580 --> 08:19.100
The feminist blogosphere is part of American culture, but I don't think any feminist would

08:19.100 --> 08:20.820
want to say that it's part of rape culture.

08:20.820 --> 08:24.460
A corollary of this is that rape could probably be somewhat reduced by opposing these rapey

08:24.460 --> 08:26.260
elements in American society.

08:26.260 --> 08:27.700
There's an argument that goes,

08:47.820 --> 08:50.900
While this might be strictly speaking true, I don't think it's the case that rape can't

08:50.900 --> 08:51.900
be reduced.

08:51.900 --> 08:52.900
How could it be reduced?

08:52.900 --> 08:55.940
Well, for one, shut down the institutions that support rape culture.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.020
Close down frat chapters that encourage or permit their members to rape.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.100
Make consent a big part of sex education.

09:01.100 --> 09:05.340
I know that shitlords argue we already teach men not to rape and no more education is necessary.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.460
Telling women to stay home, to not drink, and to dress like nuns is the only option

09:08.460 --> 09:09.620
we have, they say.

09:09.620 --> 09:14.300
But I for one never really encountered a sophisticated discussion about consent until age 22, when

09:14.300 --> 09:17.340
I received my cultural Marxist brainwashing from academic feminism.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.660
In high school sex ed, I learned that abstinence is the only safe option.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.620
I gave a class presentation on scabies, and that was about it.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.980
There was nothing about determining whether someone is too intoxicated to consent or what

09:26.980 --> 09:30.980
coercion looks like, though these topics are kind of complicated and, to a lot of people,

09:30.980 --> 09:32.380
apparently not obvious.

09:32.380 --> 09:35.700
Kids receive mixed messages about it from their peers, and so yes, I think good education

09:35.700 --> 09:37.100
on the subject would in fact help.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.740
And I don't think parents are doing an adequate job either.

09:39.740 --> 09:43.100
Brock Turner's dad still can't really face the fact that his son is a rapist even after

09:43.100 --> 09:44.160
he was convicted.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.300
Most parents understandably don't want to believe that their child is capable of raping

09:47.300 --> 09:48.300
someone.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.820
This is another area where our idea of rapists as inhuman monsters actually gets in the way

09:51.820 --> 09:52.820
of preventing rape.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.860
The Brock Turner case is interesting because it illustrates some of the ways that there

09:55.860 --> 09:59.740
are still remnants of rape culture in America, but it also illustrates how things have changed

09:59.740 --> 10:00.860
for the better.

10:00.860 --> 10:04.140
On the one hand, there is the tendency of the media, and for that matter the judge,

10:04.140 --> 10:08.300
to sympathize with the rapist, to downplay his crimes, and to lament the ruined opportunities

10:08.300 --> 10:10.940
that will result from the tragedy of his having raped someone.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.660
On the other hand, Brock has been widely vilified on the internet.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.020
His comparatively lenient sentence has been met with outrage, and the Vice President of

10:17.020 --> 10:19.820
the United States has publicly declared his victim a hero.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.140
This is the opposite of what we would expect from a rape culture, and it indicates that

10:23.140 --> 10:25.140
major progress has been made on this issue.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.740
I say progress because things used to be a lot worse.

10:27.740 --> 10:31.860
I wasn't around in the 1960s, but I think that art and media history tell a pretty compelling

10:31.860 --> 10:32.860
story.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.540
Look at this scene from Goldfinger where the hero James Bond rapes Pussy Galore until her

10:36.540 --> 10:37.700
body says yes.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.700
Skip it.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.700
I'm not interested.

10:39.700 --> 10:40.700
Let's go.

10:40.700 --> 10:45.380
What would it take for you to see things my way?

10:45.380 --> 10:48.060
A lot more than you've got.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.300
How do you know?

10:49.300 --> 10:53.580
I don't want to know.

10:53.580 --> 10:57.300
Isn't it customary to grant the condemned man his last request?

10:57.300 --> 11:00.660
You've asked for this.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.980
I'm going to skip the next 30 seconds of hilarious pre-rape jiu-jitsu.

11:04.980 --> 11:05.980
Ah.

11:05.980 --> 11:15.700
Now let's both play.

11:15.700 --> 11:24.580
It's not rape if romantic orchestral music swells in the background.

11:24.580 --> 11:27.660
It's pretty hard to imagine a script with a scene like that in it getting picked up

11:27.660 --> 11:28.660
today.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.900
But this sort of thing does still have its apologists, like in this video where professional

11:31.900 --> 11:36.580
dating coach Adam Lyons teaches you to get girls like James Bond by being persistent

11:36.580 --> 11:38.740
and not getting discouraged by resistance.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.580
I'm not going to take no for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner.

11:42.580 --> 11:47.500
And winners, we don't listen to words like no or don't or stop.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.460
Those words are just not in our vocabulary.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.460
I know what you need.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.540
And Adam Lyons knows what he's talking about.

11:52.540 --> 11:56.500
Once voted least likely to get a girlfriend at school, he's internationally regarded as

11:56.500 --> 11:58.940
one of the top three specialists on seduction.

11:58.940 --> 11:59.940
I'm sold.

11:59.940 --> 12:03.220
I think we're at a point where most of us find this unacceptable, but it's worth asking

12:03.220 --> 12:04.960
why this progress has occurred.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.260
I think a big part of it is that feminists have been complaining about this for literally

12:08.260 --> 12:11.880
decades, and a lot of people, especially in media and academia, have finally listened

12:11.880 --> 12:12.880
to them.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.840
Sometimes to get things done you just have to complain for 40 or 50 years, and it's

12:15.840 --> 12:18.600
not fun, and it sucks to listen to, but you just have to do it.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.240
Eventually the culture changes, and then everyone pretends they were on your side all along,

12:22.240 --> 12:25.640
as happened with gay rights and is currently happening with trans acceptance, and, I'm

12:25.640 --> 12:27.920
happy to report, with opposition to rape culture.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.920
The exception, of course, are the millions of troglodytes on YouTube still clinging to

12:30.920 --> 12:33.280
justifiably outdated notions about sex and gender.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.120
I'm not saying that everything feminism does is good, but that there isn't room

12:36.120 --> 12:39.540
for justified critique, since even the most righteous social movements usually come with

12:39.540 --> 12:41.080
us mattering of bad ideas.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.080
No one is perfect.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.280
Martin Luther King cheated on his wife and plagiarized his doctoral dissertation.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.100
And if Thunderf00t and Sargon had been around in 1964, they probably would have been writing

12:49.100 --> 12:51.240
articles decrying him as a cheater and a fraud.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.280
They're just a couple of rational freethinkers pointing out the facts.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.280
Fortunately, the bad ideas seem to fade out after a while, while the good ideas tend to

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
stick.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.760
In the 1970s it was a popular talking point for the women's movement that PMS is a fiction

13:02.760 --> 13:04.360
of patriarchal psychiatry.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.760
This bad idea has vanished, while the good idea that women ought to have equal employment

13:07.760 --> 13:09.160
opportunity has persisted.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.960
So it's not that there's anything wrong with critiquing the weak ideas of social

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
justice movements.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.960
I mean, that's probably what I'd be doing myself if YouTube weren't so inundated

13:15.960 --> 13:18.240
with bullying shitlord response channel bullshit.

13:18.240 --> 13:23.200
What I strongly oppose is this position that feminism is cancer, and feminism is the enemy,

13:23.200 --> 13:25.080
and feminism poisons everything.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.000
This is just reactionary and indefensible.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.440

13:34.440 --> 13:38.120
It's alright, I'm a man on the internet who makes videos about rape.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.120
What could be safer than that?
