1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
There's nothing like starting a new game of childhood to make me feel like a PokÃ©mon

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
again.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
Huh.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,880
No option to play as a female character.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,560
Wait, is that sexist?

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
Is this patriarchy?

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,080
Is this a trope versus women?

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
No!

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
Not here!

10
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Not in my childhood!

11
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
I need a-

12
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,080
Get out of my childhood!

13
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,080
Oh god, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,520
Forgive me, sweet mother, dark mother, cold mother, kind mother, cruel mother.

15
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,320
Baby, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,800
I don't like arguing about feminism itself, because no one agrees what feminism means,

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,200
and if you call yourself a feminist you're vulnerable to what we might call the Trigglypuff

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,400
argument, where your opponent says, look at this dumb retarded feminist, and you end up

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,480
feeling like you have to apologize for something you never agreed with in the first place.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,760
So let's just skip the debate about what feminism means, and about who is or isn't a feminist.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,440
The important thing are the substantive issues, and one of the big ones is rape culture.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,640
So let's start with that.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,120
In the shitlord corners of YouTube, the consensus seems to be that there is such a thing as

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,960
a rape culture, but that it's only the province of Muslims and the blacks.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,160
Sargon in particular has made this claim several times.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,840
While I certainly agree that there are rape cultures in African and Muslim societies,

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,280
I don't think that we in the West are entirely off the hook.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,680
I also think it's more important for us to establish whether or not there is a rape culture

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,560
in our own societies than it is to protest on behalf of people living in Africa, simply

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,960
because we have more influence over our own cultures than we do over what people are doing

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,260
in the Congo.

32
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,920
This is also my response to people who say, why are feminists complaining about first

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,800
world problems when there's still female genital mutilation in Egypt?

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, if I could press a button and end female genital mutilation in Egypt, then I would.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,000
But the truth is that I have no influence whatsoever over cultural traditions in North

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,480
Africa, whereas I do at least have a small influence over the people in my immediate

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
vicinity.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,560
So if it turns out that there is a rape culture in America, then that has more of a moral

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
pull on me than whatever it is that people are doing in Somalia.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,320
And to be clear, I'm not saying that you shouldn't care about female genital mutilation.

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
I agree that it's important to be an informed global citizen and all that shit.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,480
I'm just saying that you have more influence and therefore more responsibility within your

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
own society.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,320
So the question I'm addressing is whether there's a rape culture in Western society.

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,200
But this is actually a pretty bad way of framing the issue, since Western society is an extremely

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,340
vague term.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,840
What counts as Western society?

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
Does Moldova count?

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Does Australia?

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
Does Mexico?

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,600
But even if we restrict the topic to just one country, it remains unclear what it would

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,040
mean to say that, for example, American culture is a rape culture.

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
What is American culture?

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Are we talking about hip hop culture?

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,380
Appalachian culture?

56
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,660
Juggalo culture?

57
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
This gets pretty complicated.

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,780
It's like doing my goddamn taxes.

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,160
The standard deduction must be prorated using the Maryland income factor.

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,780
Prorate the standard deduction using the following formula.

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,340
Standard deduction times Maryland income factor equals prorated standard deduction.

62
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
What the fuck is the Maryland income factor?

63
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,940
God damn it!

64
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,520
What do feminists mean when they say we live in a rape culture?

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Who are we?

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
What is culture?

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
What is is?

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Enlighten us, Socrates!

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,460
All of us will die before these questions are answered, so I'm going to push ahead with

70
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,940
a warning that clarifications might be necessary.

71
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,660
The phrase rape culture describes an environment where rape is normalized and justified and

72
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,700
where rape victims are shamed and blamed.

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,580
Certainly this accurately describes the culture of Congolese warlords and Homeric heroes,

74
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,420
but in a different way it also pertains to societies that do not openly endorse rape.

75
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,140
A common argument against the idea of first world rape culture has it that because rape

76
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,340
is illegal and because rape among crimes is reviled almost uniquely, there is no way that

77
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,900
say American society could be accurately described as a rape culture.

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,780
But of course there are also laws against drugs, and we're all taught that drugs are

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,580
bad in school, yet still there exists a drug culture.

80
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,900
Not that I know anything about drug culture.

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,420
I've read a couple articles about it.

82
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,820
One took over the line, sweet Jesus, one took over the line.

83
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Shh!

84
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,340
Part of what's going on here is that our culture is in conflict.

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,540
On the one hand, there's our education and the law telling us that drugs are bad, and

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,820
on the other hand there's the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industries telling us that

87
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,300
drugs are the solution to anxiety and sadness, and on the third hand, there's the goddamn

88
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,660
media that glamorizes partying and hedonism.

89
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
As it should.

90
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,940
Those things are glamorous and fun.

91
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,300
Something similar is going on with rape.

92
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,500
On the one hand, we view rape as this crime to end all crimes, this abomination so fathomless

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,660
and evil that we dare not even joke about it.

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
And on the other hand...

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,580
There's almost an air of protesting too much about our hatred of rape.

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,980
It reminds me of our collective attitude toward pedophilia.

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,100
Overtly, we hate it so intensely that there are actually vigilante gangs of pedophile

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,940
hunters in reality TV shows dedicated to persecuting potential offenders.

99
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,260
At the same time, we fetishize youth and even childhood to such an extent that the explicit

100
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,460
disdain we hold towards pedophiles almost amounts to a kind of doublethink.

101
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Likewise, I think our society is essentially conflicted about rape.

102
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,860
I also think that, far from being knocked down proof that there is no rape culture,

103
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,060
the exaggerated horror we reserve for an extreme idea of rape actually helps to provide cover

104
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,820
for more common everyday rape.

105
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,060
If rape is the worst of crimes and rapists are monsters, then why don't we feel like

106
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,500
we're looking at abject evil when confronted with an actual rapist, like, say, Brock Turner

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,060
of Stanford Dumpster fame?

108
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,980
Well, probably it's because fingering an unconscious woman for a few minutes is not the worst crime

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,500
humans are capable of, and Brock Turner is probably not a total monster.

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,940
In fact, if you're an upper-middle-class Stanford alum like the judge who sentenced

111
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,660
him to six months in county jail, he might even seem relatable and sympathetic.

112
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,180
But what Brock did still is rape, and it is illegal and immoral.

113
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,020
His crime just wasn't some kind of especially heinous law-and-order SVU-type situation.

114
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,940
So Christina buys him breakfast, he rapes her for lunch.

115
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,380
So there's a mismatch about what we say we think about rape and what we actually think.

116
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,060
The idea that psychopathy or some inherent and incorrigible moral defect is what leads

117
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,700
men to rape also supports the argument that teaching men not to rape is a hare-brained

118
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,380
feminist pipe dream.

119
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,940
Rapists know that rape is wrong, the argument goes.

120
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,140
You can't teach thieves not to steal.

121
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,100
Put your hands up if you have a lock on your front door.

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Why do you do that?

123
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Why do you put a lock-

124
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Don't you even start.

125
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,980
Look, everyone agrees that the sentence rape is wrong is true because the word rape is

126
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,940
loaded with negative moral value.

127
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,420
The problem is not that rapists don't accept the truth of the proposition rape is wrong,

128
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,540
it's that they don't even think of their behavior as rape in the first place.

129
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,220
The people who argue that rapists know that rape is wrong have a bad theory about the

130
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,740
psychology of rapists.

131
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,460
In Brock Turner's statement in court, he said,

132
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,060
The same Broadly article that quote is from also quotes the vice president of the European

133
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,620
Men's Health Forum, who says,

134
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,180
Instead, the phrase you constantly hear them say is,

135
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,780
I thought she wanted it too.

136
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,620
A few years ago, there was an Ask a Rapist thread on Reddit, where rapists and people

137
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,380
who had almost committed rape shared their side of the story.

138
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,940
Very few of the rapists claimed to have been thinking at the time,

139
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,340
I know that rape is wrong, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I'm so evil.

140
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,460
Much more common is, that's when I thought she must have wanted it.

141
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
There's also a lot of rationalizing and justifying.

142
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,420
The men can't control themselves theory is very popular with rapists.

143
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,540
An erect penis has no conscience, as one rapist puts it.

144
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,740
And actually that's true, but you are not a slave to your penis, sir.

145
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,220
Blaming alcohol is also popular, which I take personal offense to since I've been drunk

146
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,300
since 2008 and I never raped anyone.

147
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Now there are some exceptions to the rule that American rape culture is subtle.

148
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,180
Some fraternities have straight-up Mycenaean rape cultures that would make any ISIS rape

149
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
lord proud.

150
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,940
A few years ago, a Phi Kappa Tau member at Georgia Tech sent an email to his chapter

151
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,380
titled Luring Your Rape Bait, in which he describes a simple seven-step system for weaponizing

152
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,540
alcohol to coerce girls into sex, ejaculate inside of them, and shove them out of your

153
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
room.

154
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,340
Of course, the email also says, no raping, in all caps, so I guess it's not really rape.

155
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
There is no rape culture.

156
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Case closed.

157
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,740
My theory about fraternity rape culture is that it begins with sadomasochistic hazing

158
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,420
rituals and just generally doing gay rapey shit to people who are unconscious.

159
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,020
This creates an atmosphere of disrespect for consent and bodily autonomy, which is propped

160
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,900
up by an ideology of male bonding, and comes to seem harmless and normal.

161
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,300
Then when women stumble into the lair, they're treated with the same lack of respect, mind

162
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,900
us the male bonding, and plus misogyny and social pressure to get laid by any means necessary,

163
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
and the result is rape.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,940
Now, the existence of fraternity rape culture doesn't prove that America is a rape culture,

165
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,260
but that's not exactly what I'm trying to prove.

166
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,300
My point is that there are significant segments of American society that implicitly or explicitly

167
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,580
encourage rape.

168
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,100
The feminist blogosphere is part of American culture, but I don't think any feminist would

169
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,820
want to say that it's part of rape culture.

170
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,460
A corollary of this is that rape could probably be somewhat reduced by opposing these rapey

171
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,260
elements in American society.

172
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,700
There's an argument that goes,

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,900
While this might be strictly speaking true, I don't think it's the case that rape can't

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,900
be reduced.

175
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
How could it be reduced?

176
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,940
Well, for one, shut down the institutions that support rape culture.

177
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,020
Close down frat chapters that encourage or permit their members to rape.

178
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,100
Make consent a big part of sex education.

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,340
I know that shitlords argue we already teach men not to rape and no more education is necessary.

180
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,460
Telling women to stay home, to not drink, and to dress like nuns is the only option

181
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,620
we have, they say.

182
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,300
But I for one never really encountered a sophisticated discussion about consent until age 22, when

183
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,340
I received my cultural Marxist brainwashing from academic feminism.

184
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,660
In high school sex ed, I learned that abstinence is the only safe option.

185
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,620
I gave a class presentation on scabies, and that was about it.

186
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,980
There was nothing about determining whether someone is too intoxicated to consent or what

187
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,980
coercion looks like, though these topics are kind of complicated and, to a lot of people,

188
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,380
apparently not obvious.

189
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,700
Kids receive mixed messages about it from their peers, and so yes, I think good education

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,100
on the subject would in fact help.

191
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,740
And I don't think parents are doing an adequate job either.

192
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,100
Brock Turner's dad still can't really face the fact that his son is a rapist even after

193
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,160
he was convicted.

194
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,300
Most parents understandably don't want to believe that their child is capable of raping

195
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
someone.

196
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,820
This is another area where our idea of rapists as inhuman monsters actually gets in the way

197
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
of preventing rape.

198
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,860
The Brock Turner case is interesting because it illustrates some of the ways that there

199
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,740
are still remnants of rape culture in America, but it also illustrates how things have changed

200
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,860
for the better.

201
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,140
On the one hand, there is the tendency of the media, and for that matter the judge,

202
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,300
to sympathize with the rapist, to downplay his crimes, and to lament the ruined opportunities

203
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,940
that will result from the tragedy of his having raped someone.

204
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,660
On the other hand, Brock has been widely vilified on the internet.

205
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,020
His comparatively lenient sentence has been met with outrage, and the Vice President of

206
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,820
the United States has publicly declared his victim a hero.

207
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,140
This is the opposite of what we would expect from a rape culture, and it indicates that

208
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
major progress has been made on this issue.

209
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,740
I say progress because things used to be a lot worse.

210
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,860
I wasn't around in the 1960s, but I think that art and media history tell a pretty compelling

211
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
story.

212
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,540
Look at this scene from Goldfinger where the hero James Bond rapes Pussy Galore until her

213
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,700
body says yes.

214
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Skip it.

215
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm not interested.

216
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Let's go.

217
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,380
What would it take for you to see things my way?

218
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,060
A lot more than you've got.

219
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,300
How do you know?

220
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,580
I don't want to know.

221
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,300
Isn't it customary to grant the condemned man his last request?

222
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,660
You've asked for this.

223
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,980
I'm going to skip the next 30 seconds of hilarious pre-rape jiu-jitsu.

224
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Ah.

225
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:15,700
Now let's both play.

226
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:24,580
It's not rape if romantic orchestral music swells in the background.

227
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,660
It's pretty hard to imagine a script with a scene like that in it getting picked up

228
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
today.

229
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,900
But this sort of thing does still have its apologists, like in this video where professional

230
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,580
dating coach Adam Lyons teaches you to get girls like James Bond by being persistent

231
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,740
and not getting discouraged by resistance.

232
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,580
I'm not going to take no for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner.

233
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,500
And winners, we don't listen to words like no or don't or stop.

234
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,460
Those words are just not in our vocabulary.

235
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
I know what you need.

236
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,540
And Adam Lyons knows what he's talking about.

237
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,500
Once voted least likely to get a girlfriend at school, he's internationally regarded as

238
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,940
one of the top three specialists on seduction.

239
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
I'm sold.

240
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,220
I think we're at a point where most of us find this unacceptable, but it's worth asking

241
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,960
why this progress has occurred.

242
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,260
I think a big part of it is that feminists have been complaining about this for literally

243
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,880
decades, and a lot of people, especially in media and academia, have finally listened

244
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
to them.

245
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,840
Sometimes to get things done you just have to complain for 40 or 50 years, and it's

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,600
not fun, and it sucks to listen to, but you just have to do it.

247
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Eventually the culture changes, and then everyone pretends they were on your side all along,

248
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,640
as happened with gay rights and is currently happening with trans acceptance, and, I'm

249
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,920
happy to report, with opposition to rape culture.

250
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
The exception, of course, are the millions of troglodytes on YouTube still clinging to

251
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,280
justifiably outdated notions about sex and gender.

252
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm not saying that everything feminism does is good, but that there isn't room

253
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,540
for justified critique, since even the most righteous social movements usually come with

254
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,080
us mattering of bad ideas.

255
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
No one is perfect.

256
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Martin Luther King cheated on his wife and plagiarized his doctoral dissertation.

257
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,100
And if Thunderf00t and Sargon had been around in 1964, they probably would have been writing

258
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,240
articles decrying him as a cheater and a fraud.

259
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,280
They're just a couple of rational freethinkers pointing out the facts.

260
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Fortunately, the bad ideas seem to fade out after a while, while the good ideas tend to

261
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
stick.

262
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,760
In the 1970s it was a popular talking point for the women's movement that PMS is a fiction

263
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,360
of patriarchal psychiatry.

264
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,760
This bad idea has vanished, while the good idea that women ought to have equal employment

265
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,160
opportunity has persisted.

266
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,960
So it's not that there's anything wrong with critiquing the weak ideas of social

267
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
justice movements.

268
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I mean, that's probably what I'd be doing myself if YouTube weren't so inundated

269
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,240
with bullying shitlord response channel bullshit.

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
What I strongly oppose is this position that feminism is cancer, and feminism is the enemy,

271
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
and feminism poisons everything.

272
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,000
This is just reactionary and indefensible.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,440
If you liked this video, please like, subscribe, and PM me your nudes.

274
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,120
It's alright, I'm a man on the internet who makes videos about rape.

275
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
What could be safer than that?
