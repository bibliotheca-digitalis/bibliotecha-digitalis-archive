00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Tell me, Lao Shih, what is the meaning of freedom?

00:29.000 --> 00:37.240
The 21st Century's first great work of political philosophy is Charlie Goes America All Over

00:37.240 --> 00:42.620
Everybody's Ass, Season 2 Episode 9 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

00:42.620 --> 00:46.360
The episode begins with a dispute about smoking bans and bars.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.360
I work in this bar.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
I work here.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.480
But that's because you have the freedom to choose to work here.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.520
Charlie and Dee argue that they shouldn't have to work in a smoke-filled environment,

00:53.520 --> 00:57.380
while Mac and Dennis argue that smoking bans are anti-freedom and un-American, prompting

00:57.380 --> 01:00.300
Charlie and Dee to leave the bar to join an anti-smoking crusade.

01:00.300 --> 01:04.280
Meanwhile, Mac, Dennis, and Frank plot to turn patties into the most American bar in

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
all of America.

01:05.280 --> 01:09.800
We will open up patties as the most American bar in all of America, a place with absolute

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
freedom.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.240
Their explicit intention is to create a space with no rules and no restrictions, a place

01:14.240 --> 01:15.420
where anything goes.

01:15.420 --> 01:19.260
However, it's clear from the ensuing discussion that they have a specific vision of what a

01:19.260 --> 01:24.040
no-rules bar would be likeâ€”namely, a bar where they, the straight-ish white men, are

01:24.040 --> 01:28.560
in charge, and where hot college co-eds want to go wild and remove their tops, like at

01:28.560 --> 01:39.040
Mardi Gras in New Orleans.

01:39.040 --> 01:43.680
The problem is that the allure of a no-rules bar soon attracts Frank's Vietnamese gambling

01:43.680 --> 01:47.700
ring, as well as the degenerate McPoils, the presence of whom creates an environment where

01:47.700 --> 01:51.160
hot college co-eds don't really feel like going wild.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.800
This prompts Mac and Dennis to realize that having no rules doesn't really produce the

01:54.800 --> 01:58.840
situation they were hoping for, but when they propose setting some boundaries, Frank throws

01:58.840 --> 02:04.840
their freedom-loving rhetoric right back at them.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.960
The situation at the bar soon devolves into a nightmare of milky incest, drug addiction,

02:08.960 --> 02:19.760
weird Vietnamese music, and the gang all accusing one another of treading on freedom.

02:19.760 --> 02:23.560
Dennis and Mac are finally forced to accept defeat, and the episode ends with them reluctantly

02:23.560 --> 02:30.800
agreeing to call the cops.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.480
This episode is so efficient at conveying the paradoxes of freedom, it should honestly

02:34.480 --> 02:36.380
be taught in university courses.

02:36.380 --> 02:41.400
It shows the way an abstract value like freedom is always invoked in particular circumstances.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.300
It's always imagined as the freedom of specific people to do specific things without the constraint

02:46.300 --> 02:48.140
of specific regulations.

02:48.140 --> 02:52.940
So for Mac and Dennis, freedom means the freedom of Mac and Dennis to host a Girls Gone Wild

02:52.940 --> 02:57.460
Mardi Gras-type situation without the constraint of rules banning toplessness.

02:57.460 --> 03:01.380
It doesn't initially occur to them that the presence of Vietnamese gamblers and milk-guzzling

03:01.380 --> 03:04.020
perverts might also have an inhibiting effect.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.100
This general pattern is repeated when it comes to freedom of speech.

03:07.100 --> 03:11.360
At the level of government, the US Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws restricting

03:11.360 --> 03:12.560
the freedom of speech.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.460
But in any given forum of discussion, you'll find there are always rules restricting what

03:16.460 --> 03:17.460
you can say.

03:17.460 --> 03:21.140
Let's take a look at 4chan, much celebrated as a den of total anarchy.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.140
A RULES?

03:22.140 --> 03:24.700
Wait, but I thought 4chan loved freedom.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.660
I thought it was the most American image board in all of America.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.980
Well thank god there's still Newgrounds.

03:28.980 --> 03:33.640
Hold on, racism is not allowed on 4chan, except on B. But even on B you aren't allowed to

03:33.640 --> 03:35.200
post about My Little Pony.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.580
This is outrageous!

03:36.580 --> 03:38.740
What about brony freedom, 4chan?

03:38.740 --> 03:42.560
I will stand up for the bronies.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.320
The point is, any forum needs to have a few rules in place in order to maintain the purpose

03:46.320 --> 03:48.080
and functionality of the forum.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.600
Now you might say, well, who do we trust to make the rules, and what's to stop the rules

03:51.600 --> 03:53.920
from being abused once they're in place?

03:53.920 --> 03:58.200
Well, welcome to the most basic problem of political theory, a problem that is unavoidable.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.240
We'll always be arguing over what the rules should be, who gets to make them, and how

04:02.240 --> 04:03.240
they should be enforced.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.360
But just because the current rules suck, or are administered incompetently, doesn't mean

04:07.360 --> 04:12.080
that we can or should have no rules, and not even 4chan disagrees with me here, at least

04:12.080 --> 04:13.500
not in practice.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.640
Because even if your forum is a den of fascism and child pornography, there will always come

04:17.640 --> 04:21.100
a moment when everyone looks around at each other and says, maybe we need to set up a

04:21.100 --> 04:22.100
couple boundaries.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.420
It's a free country, bitch.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.720
I don't know why brony posts are restricted to a specific section of 4chan, but I'm guessing

04:29.720 --> 04:33.580
it was because bronies wouldn't stop posting their goddamn shit everywhere and it was driving

04:33.580 --> 04:35.540
everyone crazy and ruining the site.

04:35.540 --> 04:39.620
Likewise, the most American bar in America probably needs to have rules against gambling,

04:39.620 --> 04:43.500
milk, and incest, at least if they want to maintain an environment where hot coeds feel

04:43.500 --> 04:44.500
like going wild.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.940
And universities probably shouldn't be hosting goddamn trolls whose only stated purpose is

04:48.940 --> 04:53.180
Keck-triggering liberals if they want to remain spaces where intellectual discussion among

04:53.180 --> 04:56.460
students and faculty with a diversity of viewpoints can flourish.

04:56.460 --> 05:00.740
But this disinvitation issue has been seized by commentators like Dave Rubin, who object

05:00.740 --> 05:05.180
to the cancellation of bullying dinguses with no redeeming value, or of commencement speakers

05:05.180 --> 05:09.060
who are there to preside over a celebration more than to discuss ideas anyway.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.300
And all of this gets blown way out of proportion.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.260
The many right-wing speakers who regularly appear on college campuses are ignored, the

05:15.260 --> 05:19.620
left-wing speakers who are disinvited are ignored, and Dave keeps harping on the left-hates-free-speech

05:19.620 --> 05:20.780
talking point.

05:20.780 --> 05:21.780
Why?

05:21.780 --> 05:25.700
Well, because it allows him to adopt this phony neutral posture of a centrist defending

05:25.700 --> 05:29.780
free speech, when what he's really doing is smearing and discrediting social justice

05:29.780 --> 05:33.260
movements while sidestepping any deep engagement with their actual ideas.

05:33.260 --> 05:37.460
Now I should say that disinviting speakers is not generally a good way to deal with proponents

05:37.460 --> 05:42.160
of offensive views on campus, and students do sometimes abuse this approach to disinvite

05:42.160 --> 05:46.260
speakers who actually do have something to say, offensive and false though it may be.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.440
But Milo Yiannopoulos is nothing but an open saboteur of the discourse, and his absence

05:50.440 --> 05:54.460
only makes conversations between liberals and good-faith conservatives easier.

05:54.460 --> 05:58.180
Now this is not to say I support the student riots at Berkeley and elsewhere aimed at shutting

05:58.180 --> 06:00.180
down people like Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter.

06:00.180 --> 06:01.180
I actually don't.

06:01.180 --> 06:05.580
I mean, I understand why they riot, and I sympathize to a certain extent, but honestly

06:05.580 --> 06:09.500
we don't even need to have the conversation about the morality of silencing Milo, since

06:09.500 --> 06:13.580
no leftist attempt to deplatform him ever did anything except add to his celebrity and

06:13.580 --> 06:14.580
amplify his voice.

06:14.580 --> 06:19.420
Milo was never successfully silenced, until the right-wingers at CPAC and Breitbart decided

06:19.420 --> 06:21.500
to deplatform him once and for all.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.060
So tell me, Dave, who hates free speech now?

06:24.060 --> 06:26.060
Freedom is life.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.060
Life is vitality.

06:28.060 --> 06:34.060
Vitality is the milk of the wolf.

06:35.900 --> 06:39.260
When I was a grad student, I went to a talk by a pretty famous philosopher.

06:39.260 --> 06:44.100
He was speaking about ancient Greek philosophy and the superiority of the contemplative life

06:44.100 --> 06:45.900
over all other ways of living.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.060
During the question and answer session, a black woman raised her hand.

06:49.060 --> 06:53.020
She was one of the only people of colour in the room, typical for academic philosophy,

06:53.020 --> 06:55.120
and probably the only black woman there.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.700
She asked, isn't it a little elitist to suggest that being a philosopher is the best way to

06:59.700 --> 07:00.700
live your life?

07:00.700 --> 07:04.340
And the professor responded, well, I don't see anything elitist about it.

07:04.380 --> 07:09.180
I mean, I only teach Princeton students, but after all, there were slave women in the garden

07:09.180 --> 07:10.180
of Epicurus.

07:10.180 --> 07:14.420
At which point I was thinking, I would rather lie down with a goat than continue being in

07:14.420 --> 07:15.420
this room.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.380
And if that's how I felt, how did she feel?

07:17.380 --> 07:21.500
And the professor, hold on, I'm not in this field anymore, I don't have to protect anybody.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.500
You know what?

07:22.500 --> 07:27.460
It was John Cooper of Princeton University, the editor of this very famous Plato anthology.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.460
What do we got here?

07:29.460 --> 07:30.460
What do we got here?

07:30.460 --> 07:31.460
What's this?

07:31.460 --> 07:32.460
What's...

07:32.580 --> 07:34.580
Boy, Plato, complete works.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.580
Cooper!

07:36.580 --> 07:37.580
This is a call out.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.940
What you have to realize is each year every philosophy department in America has these

07:40.940 --> 07:45.100
meetings where they all sit around and ask, why are there not more black people in academic

07:45.100 --> 07:46.100
philosophy?

07:46.100 --> 07:48.060
It's just a total mystery.

07:48.060 --> 07:51.900
And what Cooper said wasn't even outright bigotry, I mean, it was a microaggression.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.920
But these kinds of things can add up.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.500
My friend was just telling me that he's in a class at a top American law school with

07:57.500 --> 08:01.700
an 80 year old white professor who said the word n***a several times in class.

08:01.940 --> 08:06.700
And he presumably wasn't trying to cause offense, but a girl in the class, the only black student,

08:06.700 --> 08:09.940
started to cry, ran out of the room, and dropped the course.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.140
So there was only one black student in the course, and now there are none.

08:13.140 --> 08:15.740
And you can say, well that student just needs to toughen up.

08:15.740 --> 08:20.380
And as a pragmatic matter, that is what black people usually do and have always done.

08:20.380 --> 08:23.260
But also, don't tell black people to toughen up.

08:23.260 --> 08:26.620
Black people in America have been very tough for decades and centuries.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.020
They've been much tougher than you, I guarantee it.

08:29.060 --> 08:32.740
And I'm not saying I think these professors should be fired, but I think it's a definite

08:32.740 --> 08:36.600
problem that without even really thinking about it, certain kinds of speech can create

08:36.600 --> 08:39.700
a campus environment that's hostile to certain groups of people.

08:39.700 --> 08:44.000
So again, the question we ought to be discussing is what kind of forum do we want universities

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
to be?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.060
Who gets to feel welcome or unwelcome?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.380
Should we allow posts about My Little Pony?

08:49.380 --> 08:53.340
Does hosting speeches by outright bigots foster or detract from the kind of environment we

08:53.340 --> 08:54.340
want to create?

08:54.340 --> 08:56.180
These are legitimate questions.

08:56.180 --> 08:59.500
Questions we should all be discussing instead of the fake question, does the left hate free

08:59.500 --> 09:00.580
speech?

09:00.580 --> 09:05.300
Because what's up for discussion are not constitutional rights, but the norms of conduct for a particular

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
forum.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.780
And no one with a mature understanding of the issue would say that there should just

09:08.780 --> 09:10.500
be no rules, man.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.140
That is the position of a 16-year-old white kid who's angry that he can't say the N-word,

09:14.140 --> 09:16.100
or that he can't post brony shit on B.

09:16.100 --> 09:21.740
The ether is the light, but not all light reveals.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.740
Sometimes truth dwells in darkness.

09:26.180 --> 09:50.460
I'm singing in the rain, just singing in the rain.

09:50.460 --> 09:54.540
Never in my lifetime have I seen a bigger tantrum thrown over something so small as

09:54.540 --> 09:55.540
trigger warnings.

09:55.900 --> 10:00.300
The practice of adding warnings to media containing potentially triggering content originates

10:00.300 --> 10:02.940
in online communities of feminists and rape survivors.

10:02.940 --> 10:07.180
Effectively, it's a courtesy measure, akin to warning readers that pictures in an article

10:07.180 --> 10:09.020
may not be safe for work.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.580
Trigger warnings are apparently now sometimes used in universities, though I have to say

10:12.580 --> 10:17.460
I was a university student and then a professor until 2016 and I never once encountered a

10:17.460 --> 10:18.740
goddamn trigger warning.

10:18.740 --> 10:23.260
But for some reason, a few journalists and a lot of classical liberal YouTubers have

10:23.260 --> 10:27.140
decided that trigger warnings are a major threat to our most fundamental freedoms, and

10:27.140 --> 10:30.900
a lot of their audience has apparently believed them without really thinking about it or looking

10:30.900 --> 10:31.900
into it at all.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.580
Oh, and safe spaces, too.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.540
Let's not forget about safe spaces.

10:35.540 --> 10:40.140
From the way classical liberals talk, you'd think a safe space is a fortified area designed

10:40.140 --> 10:44.540
to permanently protect sniveling, terrified wrecks of human beings from ever encountering

10:44.540 --> 10:46.100
an idea they disagree with.

10:46.100 --> 10:51.020
In fact, the term safe space originates in LGBT communities, and designates a business,

10:51.020 --> 10:55.260
a bar, a forum, or any other venue where homophobia isn't tolerated.

10:55.260 --> 10:59.780
The concept is decades old, but recently it's been spotlighted by classical liberals claiming

10:59.780 --> 11:04.740
that campus safe spaces are, you guessed it, a harbinger of the death of free speech.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.860
The argument usually goes that safe spaces keep people from encountering ideas they disagree

11:08.860 --> 11:12.020
with, and so they have an infantilizing and a silencing effect.

11:12.020 --> 11:16.540
To which I respond that when gay people are so sheltered that they just have no idea what

11:16.540 --> 11:19.080
homophobia is, and whaaaat?

11:19.080 --> 11:21.760
Some people think marriage is only between a man and a woman.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.800
Who ever heard of such an outlandish idea?

11:23.800 --> 11:27.480
Well, then I'll admit that things have maybe gone a bit too far.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.800
But in the meantime, gay people not experiencing enough homophobia is not really striking me

11:31.800 --> 11:33.600
as a pressing social issue.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.480
For my own part, it's nice to have certain places I can go, and certain communities I

11:37.480 --> 11:41.800
can be with, where I cannot have my gender identity or expression constantly questioned,

11:41.800 --> 11:46.640
and I can just relax and be myself, and not be constantly interrogated about it.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.800
But it's not like having safe spaces means that I've just never heard the idea that there

11:50.800 --> 11:52.200
are only two genders.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
And whaaaat?

11:53.200 --> 11:56.800
Like, we all have this idea imposed on us every day of our goddamn lives.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.640
The fact that I want a two second break from it is not silencing or infantilizing.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.400
Remember Hitchens' defensive ideas that need special protection?

12:03.400 --> 12:06.840
Oh, that person doesn't just have a right to speak.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.840
That person's right to speak must be given extra protection.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.160
Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.120
The idea that there are two genders is the default idea.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.680
The idea that I don't fit the binary was the idea it took effort to come up with.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.320
I find the notion that every commonplace prejudice and assumption needs special protection ridiculous.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.280
And you'll notice that critics of trigger warnings and safe spaces are usually pretty

12:31.280 --> 12:35.000
short on concrete examples of how these things actually erode free speech.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.280
I mean, I've heard people talk about the ways trigger warnings and safe spaces can be misused,

12:39.280 --> 12:42.000
and fair enough, that's a discussion worth having.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.440
But more often I see people alluding to them as a kind of emblem.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.800
Trigger warning and safe space culture, in order to caricature college age leftists as

12:49.800 --> 12:54.240
delicate whiny snowflakes, which, well, there might be a little truth to that.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.760
But you're lying if you pretend that this is fundamentally about free speech.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.840
And worse, you're doing it at the expense of people who have suffered actual trauma,

13:01.840 --> 13:05.480
and have embattled minority groups whose request for safe spaces is perfectly reasonable.

13:05.480 --> 13:10.040
So your sly attempt to invoke liberal values like free speech and diversity to malign these

13:10.040 --> 13:13.000
people is taking a pretty low road indeed.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.920
And I want to ask people who constantly make jokes about trigger warnings and safe spaces,

13:16.920 --> 13:20.240
what percentage of confidence are you at that you're not just being a huge fucking asshole

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
for no reason?

13:21.240 --> 13:27.560
The dark mother casts shade over the blinding fire, revealing in shadow what was hidden

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
by the light.

13:28.560 --> 13:37.080
Dave, I know I'm throwing a lot of criticism at you, and that sucks for you because being

13:37.080 --> 13:38.440
criticized sucks.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.920
Personally, I hate criticism.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.920
It's trash.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.160
But you of all people should be willing to acknowledge that hearing criticism of your

13:44.160 --> 13:47.800
own viewpoint is a necessary part of, like, growth or whatever.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.280
And I like to think that the two of us aren't so far apart ideologically that we can't talk

13:51.280 --> 13:55.200
to each other at all, but I worry that more and more of the people I interact with are

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
that far apart.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.160
It's kind of a scary time to be alive, Dave, and I know you believe in something called

14:00.160 --> 14:02.200
the free marketplace of ideas.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.800
You believe that the best ideas will come out on top, so long as their proponents are

14:05.800 --> 14:07.740
given a fair chance to argue for them.

14:07.780 --> 14:12.100
That must be a very comforting belief, but I regret to say I don't share the optimism.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.380
The human mind is not very rational.

14:14.380 --> 14:17.980
People pick up most of their beliefs from the culture around them, and oftentimes people

14:17.980 --> 14:21.660
seem to believe things for really self-interested reasons that have nothing to do with what

14:21.660 --> 14:24.020
is true or what the strongest arguments support.

14:24.020 --> 14:28.500
So when I see all kinds of bigotry gaining traction instead of fading away as my upbringing

14:28.500 --> 14:32.980
led me to expect, it makes me afraid for a lot of people I care about, and I kind of

14:32.980 --> 14:36.840
freak out because I don't have faith that having good facts and arguments on my side

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
will be enough.

14:37.840 --> 14:42.400
I'm honestly not sure that truth and justice will prevail, so if I seem a little on edge,

14:42.400 --> 14:44.200
that's probably part of the reason why.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.360
And I know you don't agree, but I just thought you should know that.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.600
Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be heading back to my safe space with a **** and a big fat

14:51.600 --> 14:56.080
****, which I'm going to shove deep inside of my ****, but first I like to take a big

14:56.080 --> 15:02.840
juicy **** and I like to just kind of **** and just **** it up and down **** and then

15:02.840 --> 15:10.800
I like to take my big **** and I like to just **** and just **** it all over the goddamn

15:10.800 --> 15:18.800
place until I **** the ball all over and then I like to **** and I like the sound that it

15:18.800 --> 15:24.760
makes and I like especially when **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** ****.

15:24.760 --> 15:25.960
This is where I like it.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.760
This is what feels good to me.

15:55.960 --> 16:00.080
Thank you.
