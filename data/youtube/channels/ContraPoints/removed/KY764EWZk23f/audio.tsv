0	29000	Tell me, Lao Shih, what is the meaning of freedom?
29000	37240	The 21st Century's first great work of political philosophy is Charlie Goes America All Over
37240	42620	Everybody's Ass, Season 2 Episode 9 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
42620	46360	The episode begins with a dispute about smoking bans and bars.
46360	47360	I work in this bar.
47360	48360	I work here.
48360	50480	But that's because you have the freedom to choose to work here.
50480	53520	Charlie and Dee argue that they shouldn't have to work in a smoke-filled environment,
53520	57380	while Mac and Dennis argue that smoking bans are anti-freedom and un-American, prompting
57380	60300	Charlie and Dee to leave the bar to join an anti-smoking crusade.
60300	64280	Meanwhile, Mac, Dennis, and Frank plot to turn patties into the most American bar in
64280	65280	all of America.
65280	69800	We will open up patties as the most American bar in all of America, a place with absolute
69800	70800	freedom.
70800	74240	Their explicit intention is to create a space with no rules and no restrictions, a place
74240	75420	where anything goes.
75420	79260	However, it's clear from the ensuing discussion that they have a specific vision of what a
79260	84040	no-rules bar would be likeâ€”namely, a bar where they, the straight-ish white men, are
84040	88560	in charge, and where hot college co-eds want to go wild and remove their tops, like at
88560	99040	Mardi Gras in New Orleans.
99040	103680	The problem is that the allure of a no-rules bar soon attracts Frank's Vietnamese gambling
103680	107700	ring, as well as the degenerate McPoils, the presence of whom creates an environment where
107700	111160	hot college co-eds don't really feel like going wild.
111160	114800	This prompts Mac and Dennis to realize that having no rules doesn't really produce the
114800	118840	situation they were hoping for, but when they propose setting some boundaries, Frank throws
118840	124840	their freedom-loving rhetoric right back at them.
124840	128960	The situation at the bar soon devolves into a nightmare of milky incest, drug addiction,
128960	139760	weird Vietnamese music, and the gang all accusing one another of treading on freedom.
139760	143560	Dennis and Mac are finally forced to accept defeat, and the episode ends with them reluctantly
143560	150800	agreeing to call the cops.
150800	154480	This episode is so efficient at conveying the paradoxes of freedom, it should honestly
154480	156380	be taught in university courses.
156380	161400	It shows the way an abstract value like freedom is always invoked in particular circumstances.
161400	166300	It's always imagined as the freedom of specific people to do specific things without the constraint
166300	168140	of specific regulations.
168140	172940	So for Mac and Dennis, freedom means the freedom of Mac and Dennis to host a Girls Gone Wild
172940	177460	Mardi Gras-type situation without the constraint of rules banning toplessness.
177460	181380	It doesn't initially occur to them that the presence of Vietnamese gamblers and milk-guzzling
181380	184020	perverts might also have an inhibiting effect.
184020	187100	This general pattern is repeated when it comes to freedom of speech.
187100	191360	At the level of government, the US Constitution prohibits Congress from making laws restricting
191360	192560	the freedom of speech.
192560	196460	But in any given forum of discussion, you'll find there are always rules restricting what
196460	197460	you can say.
197460	201140	Let's take a look at 4chan, much celebrated as a den of total anarchy.
201140	202140	A RULES?
202140	204700	Wait, but I thought 4chan loved freedom.
204700	207660	I thought it was the most American image board in all of America.
207660	208980	Well thank god there's still Newgrounds.
208980	213640	Hold on, racism is not allowed on 4chan, except on B. But even on B you aren't allowed to
213640	215200	post about My Little Pony.
215200	216580	This is outrageous!
216580	218740	What about brony freedom, 4chan?
218740	222560	I will stand up for the bronies.
222560	226320	The point is, any forum needs to have a few rules in place in order to maintain the purpose
226320	228080	and functionality of the forum.
228080	231600	Now you might say, well, who do we trust to make the rules, and what's to stop the rules
231600	233920	from being abused once they're in place?
233920	238200	Well, welcome to the most basic problem of political theory, a problem that is unavoidable.
238200	242240	We'll always be arguing over what the rules should be, who gets to make them, and how
242240	243240	they should be enforced.
243240	247360	But just because the current rules suck, or are administered incompetently, doesn't mean
247360	252080	that we can or should have no rules, and not even 4chan disagrees with me here, at least
252080	253500	not in practice.
253500	257640	Because even if your forum is a den of fascism and child pornography, there will always come
257640	261100	a moment when everyone looks around at each other and says, maybe we need to set up a
261100	262100	couple boundaries.
262100	265420	It's a free country, bitch.
265420	269720	I don't know why brony posts are restricted to a specific section of 4chan, but I'm guessing
269720	273580	it was because bronies wouldn't stop posting their goddamn shit everywhere and it was driving
273580	275540	everyone crazy and ruining the site.
275540	279620	Likewise, the most American bar in America probably needs to have rules against gambling,
279620	283500	milk, and incest, at least if they want to maintain an environment where hot coeds feel
283500	284500	like going wild.
284500	288940	And universities probably shouldn't be hosting goddamn trolls whose only stated purpose is
288940	293180	Keck-triggering liberals if they want to remain spaces where intellectual discussion among
293180	296460	students and faculty with a diversity of viewpoints can flourish.
296460	300740	But this disinvitation issue has been seized by commentators like Dave Rubin, who object
300740	305180	to the cancellation of bullying dinguses with no redeeming value, or of commencement speakers
305180	309060	who are there to preside over a celebration more than to discuss ideas anyway.
309060	311300	And all of this gets blown way out of proportion.
311300	315260	The many right-wing speakers who regularly appear on college campuses are ignored, the
315260	319620	left-wing speakers who are disinvited are ignored, and Dave keeps harping on the left-hates-free-speech
319620	320780	talking point.
320780	321780	Why?
321780	325700	Well, because it allows him to adopt this phony neutral posture of a centrist defending
325700	329780	free speech, when what he's really doing is smearing and discrediting social justice
329780	333260	movements while sidestepping any deep engagement with their actual ideas.
333260	337460	Now I should say that disinviting speakers is not generally a good way to deal with proponents
337460	342160	of offensive views on campus, and students do sometimes abuse this approach to disinvite
342160	346260	speakers who actually do have something to say, offensive and false though it may be.
346260	350440	But Milo Yiannopoulos is nothing but an open saboteur of the discourse, and his absence
350440	354460	only makes conversations between liberals and good-faith conservatives easier.
354460	358180	Now this is not to say I support the student riots at Berkeley and elsewhere aimed at shutting
358180	360180	down people like Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter.
360180	361180	I actually don't.
361180	365580	I mean, I understand why they riot, and I sympathize to a certain extent, but honestly
365580	369500	we don't even need to have the conversation about the morality of silencing Milo, since
369500	373580	no leftist attempt to deplatform him ever did anything except add to his celebrity and
373580	374580	amplify his voice.
374580	379420	Milo was never successfully silenced, until the right-wingers at CPAC and Breitbart decided
379420	381500	to deplatform him once and for all.
381500	384060	So tell me, Dave, who hates free speech now?
384060	386060	Freedom is life.
386060	388060	Life is vitality.
388060	394060	Vitality is the milk of the wolf.
395900	399260	When I was a grad student, I went to a talk by a pretty famous philosopher.
399260	404100	He was speaking about ancient Greek philosophy and the superiority of the contemplative life
404100	405900	over all other ways of living.
405900	409060	During the question and answer session, a black woman raised her hand.
409060	413020	She was one of the only people of colour in the room, typical for academic philosophy,
413020	415120	and probably the only black woman there.
415120	419700	She asked, isn't it a little elitist to suggest that being a philosopher is the best way to
419700	420700	live your life?
420700	424340	And the professor responded, well, I don't see anything elitist about it.
424380	429180	I mean, I only teach Princeton students, but after all, there were slave women in the garden
429180	430180	of Epicurus.
430180	434420	At which point I was thinking, I would rather lie down with a goat than continue being in
434420	435420	this room.
435420	437380	And if that's how I felt, how did she feel?
437380	441500	And the professor, hold on, I'm not in this field anymore, I don't have to protect anybody.
441500	442500	You know what?
442500	447460	It was John Cooper of Princeton University, the editor of this very famous Plato anthology.
447460	449460	What do we got here?
449460	450460	What do we got here?
450460	451460	What's this?
451460	452460	What's...
452580	454580	Boy, Plato, complete works.
455580	456580	Cooper!
456580	457580	This is a call out.
457580	460940	What you have to realize is each year every philosophy department in America has these
460940	465100	meetings where they all sit around and ask, why are there not more black people in academic
465100	466100	philosophy?
466100	468060	It's just a total mystery.
468060	471900	And what Cooper said wasn't even outright bigotry, I mean, it was a microaggression.
471900	473920	But these kinds of things can add up.
473920	477500	My friend was just telling me that he's in a class at a top American law school with
477500	481700	an 80 year old white professor who said the word n***a several times in class.
481940	486700	And he presumably wasn't trying to cause offense, but a girl in the class, the only black student,
486700	489940	started to cry, ran out of the room, and dropped the course.
489940	493140	So there was only one black student in the course, and now there are none.
493140	495740	And you can say, well that student just needs to toughen up.
495740	500380	And as a pragmatic matter, that is what black people usually do and have always done.
500380	503260	But also, don't tell black people to toughen up.
503260	506620	Black people in America have been very tough for decades and centuries.
506620	509020	They've been much tougher than you, I guarantee it.
509060	512740	And I'm not saying I think these professors should be fired, but I think it's a definite
512740	516600	problem that without even really thinking about it, certain kinds of speech can create
516600	519700	a campus environment that's hostile to certain groups of people.
519700	524000	So again, the question we ought to be discussing is what kind of forum do we want universities
524000	525000	to be?
525000	527060	Who gets to feel welcome or unwelcome?
527060	529380	Should we allow posts about My Little Pony?
529380	533340	Does hosting speeches by outright bigots foster or detract from the kind of environment we
533340	534340	want to create?
534340	536180	These are legitimate questions.
536180	539500	Questions we should all be discussing instead of the fake question, does the left hate free
539500	540580	speech?
540580	545300	Because what's up for discussion are not constitutional rights, but the norms of conduct for a particular
545300	546300	forum.
546300	548780	And no one with a mature understanding of the issue would say that there should just
548780	550500	be no rules, man.
550500	554140	That is the position of a 16-year-old white kid who's angry that he can't say the N-word,
554140	556100	or that he can't post brony shit on B.
556100	561740	The ether is the light, but not all light reveals.
561740	563740	Sometimes truth dwells in darkness.
566180	590460	I'm singing in the rain, just singing in the rain.
590460	594540	Never in my lifetime have I seen a bigger tantrum thrown over something so small as
594540	595540	trigger warnings.
595900	600300	The practice of adding warnings to media containing potentially triggering content originates
600300	602940	in online communities of feminists and rape survivors.
602940	607180	Effectively, it's a courtesy measure, akin to warning readers that pictures in an article
607180	609020	may not be safe for work.
609020	612580	Trigger warnings are apparently now sometimes used in universities, though I have to say
612580	617460	I was a university student and then a professor until 2016 and I never once encountered a
617460	618740	goddamn trigger warning.
618740	623260	But for some reason, a few journalists and a lot of classical liberal YouTubers have
623260	627140	decided that trigger warnings are a major threat to our most fundamental freedoms, and
627140	630900	a lot of their audience has apparently believed them without really thinking about it or looking
630900	631900	into it at all.
631900	633580	Oh, and safe spaces, too.
633580	635540	Let's not forget about safe spaces.
635540	640140	From the way classical liberals talk, you'd think a safe space is a fortified area designed
640140	644540	to permanently protect sniveling, terrified wrecks of human beings from ever encountering
644540	646100	an idea they disagree with.
646100	651020	In fact, the term safe space originates in LGBT communities, and designates a business,
651020	655260	a bar, a forum, or any other venue where homophobia isn't tolerated.
655260	659780	The concept is decades old, but recently it's been spotlighted by classical liberals claiming
659780	664740	that campus safe spaces are, you guessed it, a harbinger of the death of free speech.
664740	668860	The argument usually goes that safe spaces keep people from encountering ideas they disagree
668860	672020	with, and so they have an infantilizing and a silencing effect.
672020	676540	To which I respond that when gay people are so sheltered that they just have no idea what
676540	679080	homophobia is, and whaaaat?
679080	681760	Some people think marriage is only between a man and a woman.
681760	683800	Who ever heard of such an outlandish idea?
683800	687480	Well, then I'll admit that things have maybe gone a bit too far.
687480	691800	But in the meantime, gay people not experiencing enough homophobia is not really striking me
691800	693600	as a pressing social issue.
693600	697480	For my own part, it's nice to have certain places I can go, and certain communities I
697480	701800	can be with, where I cannot have my gender identity or expression constantly questioned,
701800	706640	and I can just relax and be myself, and not be constantly interrogated about it.
706640	710800	But it's not like having safe spaces means that I've just never heard the idea that there
710800	712200	are only two genders.
712200	713200	And whaaaat?
713200	716800	Like, we all have this idea imposed on us every day of our goddamn lives.
716800	720640	The fact that I want a two second break from it is not silencing or infantilizing.
720640	723400	Remember Hitchens' defensive ideas that need special protection?
723400	726840	Oh, that person doesn't just have a right to speak.
726840	731840	That person's right to speak must be given extra protection.
731840	736160	Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with.
736160	739120	The idea that there are two genders is the default idea.
739120	742680	The idea that I don't fit the binary was the idea it took effort to come up with.
742680	747320	I find the notion that every commonplace prejudice and assumption needs special protection ridiculous.
747320	751280	And you'll notice that critics of trigger warnings and safe spaces are usually pretty
751280	755000	short on concrete examples of how these things actually erode free speech.
755000	759280	I mean, I've heard people talk about the ways trigger warnings and safe spaces can be misused,
759280	762000	and fair enough, that's a discussion worth having.
762000	765440	But more often I see people alluding to them as a kind of emblem.
765440	769800	Trigger warning and safe space culture, in order to caricature college age leftists as
769800	774240	delicate whiny snowflakes, which, well, there might be a little truth to that.
774240	777760	But you're lying if you pretend that this is fundamentally about free speech.
777760	781840	And worse, you're doing it at the expense of people who have suffered actual trauma,
781840	785480	and have embattled minority groups whose request for safe spaces is perfectly reasonable.
785480	790040	So your sly attempt to invoke liberal values like free speech and diversity to malign these
790040	793000	people is taking a pretty low road indeed.
793000	796920	And I want to ask people who constantly make jokes about trigger warnings and safe spaces,
796920	800240	what percentage of confidence are you at that you're not just being a huge fucking asshole
800240	801240	for no reason?
801240	807560	The dark mother casts shade over the blinding fire, revealing in shadow what was hidden
807560	808560	by the light.
808560	817080	Dave, I know I'm throwing a lot of criticism at you, and that sucks for you because being
817080	818440	criticized sucks.
818440	819920	Personally, I hate criticism.
819920	820920	It's trash.
820920	824160	But you of all people should be willing to acknowledge that hearing criticism of your
824160	827800	own viewpoint is a necessary part of, like, growth or whatever.
827800	831280	And I like to think that the two of us aren't so far apart ideologically that we can't talk
831280	835200	to each other at all, but I worry that more and more of the people I interact with are
835200	836200	that far apart.
836200	840160	It's kind of a scary time to be alive, Dave, and I know you believe in something called
840160	842200	the free marketplace of ideas.
842200	845800	You believe that the best ideas will come out on top, so long as their proponents are
845800	847740	given a fair chance to argue for them.
847780	852100	That must be a very comforting belief, but I regret to say I don't share the optimism.
852100	854380	The human mind is not very rational.
854380	857980	People pick up most of their beliefs from the culture around them, and oftentimes people
857980	861660	seem to believe things for really self-interested reasons that have nothing to do with what
861660	864020	is true or what the strongest arguments support.
864020	868500	So when I see all kinds of bigotry gaining traction instead of fading away as my upbringing
868500	872980	led me to expect, it makes me afraid for a lot of people I care about, and I kind of
872980	876840	freak out because I don't have faith that having good facts and arguments on my side
876840	877840	will be enough.
877840	882400	I'm honestly not sure that truth and justice will prevail, so if I seem a little on edge,
882400	884200	that's probably part of the reason why.
884200	887360	And I know you don't agree, but I just thought you should know that.
887360	891600	Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be heading back to my safe space with a **** and a big fat
891600	896080	****, which I'm going to shove deep inside of my ****, but first I like to take a big
896080	902840	juicy **** and I like to just kind of **** and just **** it up and down **** and then
902840	910800	I like to take my big **** and I like to just **** and just **** it all over the goddamn
910800	918800	place until I **** the ball all over and then I like to **** and I like the sound that it
918800	924760	makes and I like especially when **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** ****.
924760	925960	This is where I like it.
925960	927760	This is what feels good to me.
955960	960080	Thank you.
