0	7040	So the stereotype is that it's just a bunch of trendy Tumblr teens going through a phase.
7040	12440	Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm a grown-ass adult, I drink taxes, I pay my scotch, and
12440	25920	I'm genderqueer.
25920	26920	Let's start at the beginning.
26920	28640	What does genderqueer even mean?
28760	29760	Well, hold on.
29760	31440	Why should I even have to explain this?
31440	32440	Can people not use Google?
32440	37080	I mean, surely in this day and age, people have access to a wealth of reliable information.
37080	40760	Well, let's give YouTube a try.
40760	43560	There must be some well-thought-out and researched explanations of it.
43560	47560	No, because then if you don't identify as either, I don't even know what you would
47560	48560	call him.
48560	49920	How can you not identify as either?
49920	53040	They is not a gender.
53040	55120	Nonbinary isn't nothing.
55120	56320	Nonbinary isn't a thing.
56320	59200	All these fake little genders, they aren't a thing.
59200	61160	What if they don't identify as a human?
61160	62160	You know what?
62160	63160	Okay.
63160	66360	Well, clearly the beginning is way too advanced a place to start.
66360	69200	We're gonna need to work our way up from pre-kindergarten here.
69200	72640	Alright, teacher's gonna need a refill on the juice though.
72640	75320	And a pint of raw ether.
75320	76920	Part negative one.
76920	78320	Pre-kindergarten.
78320	82520	Now I could try yet again to explain that gender is a social and psychological concept,
82520	87240	Well, sex is the term used by biologists to describe an organism's reproductive anatomy.
87240	91680	I can tell you that biological sex itself is a pretty broad and nebulous concept, describing
91680	97240	characteristics ranging from chromosomes to hormones to primary and secondary sexual anatomy,
97240	100680	none of which are strictly binary, and most of which can be altered medically.
100680	104720	And I could point out that the dogmatic insistence on an inflexible gender binary is nothing
104720	108840	more than a deliberate political gesture aimed at denying the existence of people who don't
108840	111100	strictly conform to conventional social roles.
111100	114540	But I know that by this point in the video, a bunch of free-thinking rationalists have
114540	118820	already posted a comment explaining that it's just a simple scientific fact that there are
118820	119820	only two genders.
119820	121960	And you know, you raise a good point.
121960	125660	Why don't we start out with a proper, scientific explanation of gender?
125660	126660	Doctor?
126660	140660	Thank you doctor, that was very informative.
140660	146740	I'm glad we cleared that up.
146740	147880	Part Zero.
147880	149180	Trans and Non-Binary Identities
149180	153500	You're watching this video in the 21st century, so you're presumably aware that transgender
153500	154700	people are a thing.
154700	159100	You've probably heard that certain people are born in the wrong body, and suffer intolerable
159100	163520	dysphoria, the only remedy for which is to undergo hormone replacement therapy and gender
163520	167780	reassignment surgery with the aim of passing as the gender they always knew they truly
167780	168780	felt they were.
168900	172460	It's a story that trans people often have to tell about themselves, in order to be taken
172460	176180	seriously by doctors, and to be understood by the general public.
176180	180100	And while it does describe some trans people's experience, it's by no means the only trans
180100	182620	experience, and it may not even be the most common.
182620	186480	Some trans people only discover their gender identity later in life, some don't experience
186480	191140	dysphoria so intensely, and others, called non-binary people who may or may not consider
191140	196060	themselves trans, identify with neither gender, with both, or with something in between.
196060	199740	Now there are lots of different ways to be non-binary, and there's a lot of terminology
199740	201820	that allows us to make those distinctions.
201820	207620	So for instance, the term genderqueer, which is the term I use for myself as ofâ€¦ now,
207620	211060	is a very broad term that's basically a synonym for non-binary.
211060	214780	More specific terms include agender, which describes people who don't feel they have
214780	220020	a gender at all, genderfluid, people whose gender identity varies over time, androgyne,
220020	224180	people in the middle of the male-female spectrum, and bigender, people who identify with both
224180	225420	ends of the spectrum.
225420	228980	Now if you're fairly new to this topic, and most people are, all of this probably
228980	231060	just sounds like a bunch of fucking made-up nonsense.
231060	234280	I mean, that's what I thought the first few times I heard about it too.
234280	238100	You may be thinking that these terms describe mental states that are impossible or delusional,
238100	242780	cue shitty unoriginal jokes about attack helicopters, or alternately feelings that are universal,
242780	246140	in which case you're probably wondering why we need special terms for feelings that
246140	247380	everyone has.
247380	249820	However, all these reactions are misunderstandings.
249820	251620	Forgivable, but wrong.
251660	255660	If you want to understand better, the best way is to listen more to the specific experiences
255660	260140	of a wide variety of non-binary people, keeping in mind that no two people's experiences
260140	261140	are the same.
261140	266140	So, at the risk of being self-indulgent, we may as well start with your humble narrator.
266140	270180	And besides, gazing deep into the troubled depths of another person's soul is usually
270180	275740	at least good for a laugh, because, well, other people's pain is funny.
275740	276740	Part 1.
276740	279140	My Shameful History of Lying to Myself and My Audience
279140	284540	In the past I've described myself as a cross-dresser, a transvestite, or a degenerate pervert, and
284540	288020	that characterization shows up a lot in my previous videos, which is now coming back
288020	289020	to haunt me.
289020	291540	I'm just an old-fashioned cross-dressing pervert.
291540	295780	Hello there boys and girls, my name is Shrumbly the Transvestite.
295780	299260	Four months ago, before I became the plucky, though dipso, maniacal cross-dresser you know
299260	301700	today, I don't identify as non-binary myself.
301700	305820	In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Bluesman Muddy Waters pronounces the word
305820	306820	man.
306820	309020	I'm speaking as a mentally ill alcoholic transvestite.
309020	312600	So there are a few different reasons why I use that kind of language.
312600	316460	One is that I've always been kind of hesitant about claiming any kind of queer identity,
316460	321580	because I don't bang dudes, not yet anyway, and I don't own any rainbow flags, and most
321580	325380	of the people I've known who are non-binary are younger than me, usually assigned female
325380	329900	at birth, and they date women or each other, I don't know, it just seemed like the identity
329900	331100	wasn't for me.
331100	334660	Another reason is that I'm just kind of a self-loathing, self-denigrating person, and
334660	339620	I genuinely find it easier to just tell myself and other people that I'm a sexual deviant,
339620	342820	because it's a fun and breezy way to write the whole issue off, and it doesn't lead to
342820	345620	a whole difficult conversation about gender identity.
345620	351020	Also, YouTube is not a safe space, and it's prudent to pre-saturize yourself, to preemptively
351020	354700	say the things a bully might say, thereby robbing them of the fun.
354700	360900	Plus I really value humor, and you know, there's just nothing less funny than self-respect.
360900	363620	And there is a kind of authenticity in the self-denigration too.
363660	369180	In my past videos, I often evoke depictions of femme men as objects of ridicule or disgust,
369180	372020	for instance alluding to Silence of the Lambs or Rocky Horror.
372020	376820	And the truth is that I am kind of disgusted and horrified by myself a lot of the time.
376820	378820	Not proud of that, but it's a thing.
378820	383220	And I know this is probably not the inspiring and affirming message that you're hoping for,
383220	389620	but honestly I'm just not that inspiring of a person, so stop being inspired.
389940	394740	Anyway, I've now reached a point where I think I owe myself, and other nonbinary people,
394740	398340	a little bit better than I've been doing, and have been inspired by a lot of mostly
398340	402980	younger nonbinary people to drop some of this self-denigration and adopt a language that
402980	405780	I think actually affirms the way I feel inside.
405780	408020	Ugh, what is this channel coming to?
408020	411300	I'm talking about my feelings like a fucking queer.
411300	414340	What's next, not drinking myself into a stupor?
414340	416700	Oh shit, my defenses are lowered.
416700	420220	The bullies will make mean videos about me now, noooooo.
424540	427180	The term cross-dresser is very ill-defined.
427180	430500	Basically it refers to anyone who dresses as the opposite sex.
430500	434780	They could do it for fun, for theater, or as a sexual fetish, but essentially they'd
434780	438700	do it as a form of gender expression that's separate from their own gender identity.
438700	443300	Whereas, when I wear makeup or femme clothing, I feel like I'm expressing my own gender.
443300	445060	These aren't women's clothes.
445060	448300	I didn't steal them from a woman, they're mine.
448300	450020	And they're part of my gender expression.
450020	454980	So it's not accurate to call me a cross-dresser, because I'm not a man in women's clothes.
454980	455980	So what am I?
455980	457460	Am I a trans woman?
457460	459340	Well, that's a good question.
459340	463980	I have had mild dysphoria over the years that's sometimes bad enough that I have given serious
463980	465300	thought to transitioning.
465300	469340	I still hate my body hair and facial hair, and I spend a lot of time removing it.
469340	470340	All of it.
470340	472700	And I prefer femme or androgynous gender expression.
472700	473700	But here's the deal.
473860	479100	I'm six foot two, my shoulders are twice as wide as my waist, and I have this voice.
479100	480100	So passing?
480100	481900	It would take a lot of work.
481900	485820	Plus I'm pretty indifferent on the issue of breasts and genitals, and indifference
485820	487660	is not enough to justify surgery.
487660	492460	I have thought about HRT to get that sweet smooth estrogen skin and some alleged emotional
492460	497420	benefits, but you know, it involves a lot of doctors and therapists, and it's not really
497420	498420	my scene.
498420	499420	But it's more than just that.
499420	502800	I actually don't want to surrender some of my masculine attributes.
502800	505920	For instance, I kind of like my voice, and other people like it too.
505920	509960	People respect a masculine voice, and I'm not going to go passing on male privilege
509960	511900	just to be true to myself.
511900	516480	So I feel the term genderqueer best captures what I really am, namely some kind of freakish
516480	517980	hybrid.
528060	529060	Part Three.
529060	530060	Pronouns.
530100	534280	In some languages, like Chinese, there are no gendered pronouns, so in those languages
534280	535800	this wouldn't be an issue.
535800	539500	But English traditionally forces people to use either male or female pronouns.
539500	543060	A lot of nonbinary people choose to use they as a gender neutral pronoun.
543060	547340	Now my experience is especially true with agender people, who don't like the experience
547340	549280	of being gendered one way or another.
549280	553040	Now I'm more on the genderfluid or bigender side of nonbinary, though I don't use any
553040	557640	other term besides genderqueer because I just find these other terms are too specific.
557640	561440	But I don't experience a lack of gender so much as an excess of it, I've just got
561440	565540	too many fucking genders inside me, they're just filling me up deep inside.
565540	567520	So you can call me he or she.
567520	568520	Either is fine.
568520	573040	What I like the most is a rapid, disorienting alternation between the two, but I get that
573040	574360	that's a lot to ask for.
574360	576400	So, you know what, just call me whatever you want.
576400	578520	I'm making this real easy for you.
578520	580720	I'm basically un-misgenderable.
580720	584120	These are just unimportant labels you can just throw around and change whenever you
584120	585120	want.
585120	586120	They're like Pokemon.
586120	587120	Collect all the labels.
587120	588120	Until June.
588120	589600	Maybe I GODDAMN W-
589600	590600	Part 4.
590600	591960	Concluding unscientific postscript.
591960	596640	Oh I get it, you went to grad school, that's hilarious.
596640	599900	So let's end this video by doing a quick shoot-down of what I'm guessing are going
599900	604180	to be the most common objections to who I am.
604180	605180	Objection 1.
605180	609000	Why can't you just dress how you like without a special label, you goddamn snowflake?
609000	612360	Well as I've already said, being genderqueer is about more than just clothes.
612360	616800	It affects how I experience my own body, how I relate to other people, how the world
616800	619920	reacts to me, and even real personal shit.
619920	622520	Like who and how, I wanna BANG.
622520	625440	And when you tell genderqueer people that we shouldn't have a word for ourselves,
625440	630000	you're in effect asking us to drop the banner that allows us to understand ourselves, to
630000	633800	find each other, and to collectively demand recognition and understanding.
633800	637080	So telling us we shouldn't have a label basically amounts to asking us to shut up
637080	638640	and disappear.
638640	639640	Objection 2.
639640	640640	You're just doing this for attention.
640920	645120	Well, I do like attention, but the public aspect of this is really just the tip of a
645120	649120	psychological iceberg, so no, that's not correct.
649120	650120	Objection 3.
650120	654040	This makes you a bad feminist, because gender is a caste system, based on systemic subjugation
654040	658040	of women by men, and not just some identity that you can claim because of how you feel.
658040	659840	Well, can it be both?
659840	663440	Honestly this objection is more likely to come up for nonbinary assigned female and
663440	666960	birth people, since they can be accused of GENDER TREASY.
666960	670560	I'd suggest reading genderqueer feminist Laurie Penny's take on this.
670560	674960	Basically they identify as nonbinary, though also as a political woman, in recognition
674960	678080	of their need to defend female reproductive rights.
678080	679080	Objection 4.
679080	682600	It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders.
682600	684280	And now we've come full circle.
684280	688880	Man, can't I just enjoy parading my new identity around for five minutes without having
688880	692840	to compose a goddamn philosophical excursus justifying myself?
692840	694520	Well, the answer is no.
694520	695520	No I can't.
695520	699320	So you know what, go ahead and post your shitty hotdog biology argument in the comments
699320	702600	section you fuckin' sis scum.
702600	703600	Mm.
703600	710600	I'm gonna enjoy that.
