1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
So the stereotype is that it's just a bunch of trendy Tumblr teens going through a phase.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,440
Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm a grown-ass adult, I drink taxes, I pay my scotch, and

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm genderqueer.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
Let's start at the beginning.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,640
What does genderqueer even mean?

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Well, hold on.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,440
Why should I even have to explain this?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Can people not use Google?

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,080
I mean, surely in this day and age, people have access to a wealth of reliable information.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,760
Well, let's give YouTube a try.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,560
There must be some well-thought-out and researched explanations of it.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,560
No, because then if you don't identify as either, I don't even know what you would

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
call him.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,920
How can you not identify as either?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,040
They is not a gender.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,120
Nonbinary isn't nothing.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,320
Nonbinary isn't a thing.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,200
All these fake little genders, they aren't a thing.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,160
What if they don't identify as a human?

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
You know what?

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Okay.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,360
Well, clearly the beginning is way too advanced a place to start.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,200
We're gonna need to work our way up from pre-kindergarten here.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Alright, teacher's gonna need a refill on the juice though.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,320
And a pint of raw ether.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,920
Part negative one.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,320
Pre-kindergarten.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,520
Now I could try yet again to explain that gender is a social and psychological concept,

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Well, sex is the term used by biologists to describe an organism's reproductive anatomy.

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,680
I can tell you that biological sex itself is a pretty broad and nebulous concept, describing

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,240
characteristics ranging from chromosomes to hormones to primary and secondary sexual anatomy,

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,680
none of which are strictly binary, and most of which can be altered medically.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,720
And I could point out that the dogmatic insistence on an inflexible gender binary is nothing

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,840
more than a deliberate political gesture aimed at denying the existence of people who don't

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,100
strictly conform to conventional social roles.

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,540
But I know that by this point in the video, a bunch of free-thinking rationalists have

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,820
already posted a comment explaining that it's just a simple scientific fact that there are

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
only two genders.

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,960
And you know, you raise a good point.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,660
Why don't we start out with a proper, scientific explanation of gender?

41
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,660
Doctor?

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:20,660
Thank you doctor, that was very informative.

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,740
I'm glad we cleared that up.

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,880
Part Zero.

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,180
Trans and Non-Binary Identities

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,500
You're watching this video in the 21st century, so you're presumably aware that transgender

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
people are a thing.

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,100
You've probably heard that certain people are born in the wrong body, and suffer intolerable

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,520
dysphoria, the only remedy for which is to undergo hormone replacement therapy and gender

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,780
reassignment surgery with the aim of passing as the gender they always knew they truly

51
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
felt they were.

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,460
It's a story that trans people often have to tell about themselves, in order to be taken

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,180
seriously by doctors, and to be understood by the general public.

54
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,100
And while it does describe some trans people's experience, it's by no means the only trans

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,620
experience, and it may not even be the most common.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,480
Some trans people only discover their gender identity later in life, some don't experience

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,140
dysphoria so intensely, and others, called non-binary people who may or may not consider

58
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,060
themselves trans, identify with neither gender, with both, or with something in between.

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,740
Now there are lots of different ways to be non-binary, and there's a lot of terminology

60
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,820
that allows us to make those distinctions.

61
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,620
So for instance, the term genderqueer, which is the term I use for myself as ofâ€¦ now,

62
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,060
is a very broad term that's basically a synonym for non-binary.

63
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,780
More specific terms include agender, which describes people who don't feel they have

64
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,020
a gender at all, genderfluid, people whose gender identity varies over time, androgyne,

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,180
people in the middle of the male-female spectrum, and bigender, people who identify with both

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,420
ends of the spectrum.

67
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,980
Now if you're fairly new to this topic, and most people are, all of this probably

68
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,060
just sounds like a bunch of fucking made-up nonsense.

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,280
I mean, that's what I thought the first few times I heard about it too.

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,100
You may be thinking that these terms describe mental states that are impossible or delusional,

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,780
cue shitty unoriginal jokes about attack helicopters, or alternately feelings that are universal,

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,140
in which case you're probably wondering why we need special terms for feelings that

73
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,380
everyone has.

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,820
However, all these reactions are misunderstandings.

75
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,620
Forgivable, but wrong.

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,660
If you want to understand better, the best way is to listen more to the specific experiences

77
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,140
of a wide variety of non-binary people, keeping in mind that no two people's experiences

78
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
are the same.

79
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:26,140
So, at the risk of being self-indulgent, we may as well start with your humble narrator.

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,180
And besides, gazing deep into the troubled depths of another person's soul is usually

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,740
at least good for a laugh, because, well, other people's pain is funny.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Part 1.

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,140
My Shameful History of Lying to Myself and My Audience

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,540
In the past I've described myself as a cross-dresser, a transvestite, or a degenerate pervert, and

85
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,020
that characterization shows up a lot in my previous videos, which is now coming back

86
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
to haunt me.

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,540
I'm just an old-fashioned cross-dressing pervert.

88
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,780
Hello there boys and girls, my name is Shrumbly the Transvestite.

89
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,260
Four months ago, before I became the plucky, though dipso, maniacal cross-dresser you know

90
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,700
today, I don't identify as non-binary myself.

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,820
In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Bluesman Muddy Waters pronounces the word

92
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
man.

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm speaking as a mentally ill alcoholic transvestite.

94
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,600
So there are a few different reasons why I use that kind of language.

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,460
One is that I've always been kind of hesitant about claiming any kind of queer identity,

96
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,580
because I don't bang dudes, not yet anyway, and I don't own any rainbow flags, and most

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,380
of the people I've known who are non-binary are younger than me, usually assigned female

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,900
at birth, and they date women or each other, I don't know, it just seemed like the identity

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,100
wasn't for me.

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,660
Another reason is that I'm just kind of a self-loathing, self-denigrating person, and

101
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,620
I genuinely find it easier to just tell myself and other people that I'm a sexual deviant,

102
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,820
because it's a fun and breezy way to write the whole issue off, and it doesn't lead to

103
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,620
a whole difficult conversation about gender identity.

104
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,020
Also, YouTube is not a safe space, and it's prudent to pre-saturize yourself, to preemptively

105
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,700
say the things a bully might say, thereby robbing them of the fun.

106
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,900
Plus I really value humor, and you know, there's just nothing less funny than self-respect.

107
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,620
And there is a kind of authenticity in the self-denigration too.

108
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,180
In my past videos, I often evoke depictions of femme men as objects of ridicule or disgust,

109
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,020
for instance alluding to Silence of the Lambs or Rocky Horror.

110
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,820
And the truth is that I am kind of disgusted and horrified by myself a lot of the time.

111
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Not proud of that, but it's a thing.

112
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,220
And I know this is probably not the inspiring and affirming message that you're hoping for,

113
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,620
but honestly I'm just not that inspiring of a person, so stop being inspired.

114
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,740
Anyway, I've now reached a point where I think I owe myself, and other nonbinary people,

115
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,340
a little bit better than I've been doing, and have been inspired by a lot of mostly

116
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,980
younger nonbinary people to drop some of this self-denigration and adopt a language that

117
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,780
I think actually affirms the way I feel inside.

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,020
Ugh, what is this channel coming to?

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,300
I'm talking about my feelings like a fucking queer.

120
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,340
What's next, not drinking myself into a stupor?

121
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,700
Oh shit, my defenses are lowered.

122
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,220
The bullies will make mean videos about me now, noooooo.

123
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,180
The term cross-dresser is very ill-defined.

124
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,500
Basically it refers to anyone who dresses as the opposite sex.

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,780
They could do it for fun, for theater, or as a sexual fetish, but essentially they'd

126
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,700
do it as a form of gender expression that's separate from their own gender identity.

127
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,300
Whereas, when I wear makeup or femme clothing, I feel like I'm expressing my own gender.

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,060
These aren't women's clothes.

129
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,300
I didn't steal them from a woman, they're mine.

130
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,020
And they're part of my gender expression.

131
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,980
So it's not accurate to call me a cross-dresser, because I'm not a man in women's clothes.

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
So what am I?

133
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,460
Am I a trans woman?

134
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,340
Well, that's a good question.

135
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,980
I have had mild dysphoria over the years that's sometimes bad enough that I have given serious

136
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,300
thought to transitioning.

137
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,340
I still hate my body hair and facial hair, and I spend a lot of time removing it.

138
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
All of it.

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,700
And I prefer femme or androgynous gender expression.

140
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
But here's the deal.

141
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,100
I'm six foot two, my shoulders are twice as wide as my waist, and I have this voice.

142
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
So passing?

143
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,900
It would take a lot of work.

144
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,820
Plus I'm pretty indifferent on the issue of breasts and genitals, and indifference

145
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,660
is not enough to justify surgery.

146
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,460
I have thought about HRT to get that sweet smooth estrogen skin and some alleged emotional

147
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,420
benefits, but you know, it involves a lot of doctors and therapists, and it's not really

148
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
my scene.

149
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
But it's more than just that.

150
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,800
I actually don't want to surrender some of my masculine attributes.

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,920
For instance, I kind of like my voice, and other people like it too.

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,960
People respect a masculine voice, and I'm not going to go passing on male privilege

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,900
just to be true to myself.

154
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,480
So I feel the term genderqueer best captures what I really am, namely some kind of freakish

155
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,980
hybrid.

156
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,060
Part Three.

157
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Pronouns.

158
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,280
In some languages, like Chinese, there are no gendered pronouns, so in those languages

159
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,800
this wouldn't be an issue.

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,500
But English traditionally forces people to use either male or female pronouns.

161
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,060
A lot of nonbinary people choose to use they as a gender neutral pronoun.

162
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,340
Now my experience is especially true with agender people, who don't like the experience

163
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,280
of being gendered one way or another.

164
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,040
Now I'm more on the genderfluid or bigender side of nonbinary, though I don't use any

165
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,640
other term besides genderqueer because I just find these other terms are too specific.

166
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,440
But I don't experience a lack of gender so much as an excess of it, I've just got

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,540
too many fucking genders inside me, they're just filling me up deep inside.

168
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,520
So you can call me he or she.

169
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Either is fine.

170
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,040
What I like the most is a rapid, disorienting alternation between the two, but I get that

171
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,360
that's a lot to ask for.

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,400
So, you know what, just call me whatever you want.

173
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,520
I'm making this real easy for you.

174
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm basically un-misgenderable.

175
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,120
These are just unimportant labels you can just throw around and change whenever you

176
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
want.

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
They're like Pokemon.

178
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Collect all the labels.

179
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Until June.

180
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,600
Maybe I GODDAMN W-

181
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Part 4.

182
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Concluding unscientific postscript.

183
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Oh I get it, you went to grad school, that's hilarious.

184
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,900
So let's end this video by doing a quick shoot-down of what I'm guessing are going

185
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,180
to be the most common objections to who I am.

186
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
Objection 1.

187
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,000
Why can't you just dress how you like without a special label, you goddamn snowflake?

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,360
Well as I've already said, being genderqueer is about more than just clothes.

189
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,800
It affects how I experience my own body, how I relate to other people, how the world

190
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,920
reacts to me, and even real personal shit.

191
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Like who and how, I wanna BANG.

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,440
And when you tell genderqueer people that we shouldn't have a word for ourselves,

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
you're in effect asking us to drop the banner that allows us to understand ourselves, to

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,800
find each other, and to collectively demand recognition and understanding.

195
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,080
So telling us we shouldn't have a label basically amounts to asking us to shut up

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,640
and disappear.

197
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Objection 2.

198
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
You're just doing this for attention.

199
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,120
Well, I do like attention, but the public aspect of this is really just the tip of a

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
psychological iceberg, so no, that's not correct.

201
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Objection 3.

202
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,040
This makes you a bad feminist, because gender is a caste system, based on systemic subjugation

203
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,040
of women by men, and not just some identity that you can claim because of how you feel.

204
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Well, can it be both?

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,440
Honestly this objection is more likely to come up for nonbinary assigned female and

206
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,960
birth people, since they can be accused of GENDER TREASY.

207
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,560
I'd suggest reading genderqueer feminist Laurie Penny's take on this.

208
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,960
Basically they identify as nonbinary, though also as a political woman, in recognition

209
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,080
of their need to defend female reproductive rights.

210
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Objection 4.

211
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,600
It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders.

212
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,280
And now we've come full circle.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,880
Man, can't I just enjoy parading my new identity around for five minutes without having

214
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,840
to compose a goddamn philosophical excursus justifying myself?

215
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,520
Well, the answer is no.

216
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
No I can't.

217
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,320
So you know what, go ahead and post your shitty hotdog biology argument in the comments

218
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,600
section you fuckin' sis scum.

219
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Mm.

220
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm gonna enjoy that.
