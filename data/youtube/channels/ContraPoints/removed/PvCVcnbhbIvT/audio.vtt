WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
So the stereotype is that it's just a bunch of trendy Tumblr teens going through a phase.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.440
Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm a grown-ass adult, I drink taxes, I pay my scotch, and

00:12.440 --> 00:25.920
I'm genderqueer.

00:25.920 --> 00:26.920
Let's start at the beginning.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.640
What does genderqueer even mean?

00:28.760 --> 00:29.760
Well, hold on.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.440
Why should I even have to explain this?

00:31.440 --> 00:32.440
Can people not use Google?

00:32.440 --> 00:37.080
I mean, surely in this day and age, people have access to a wealth of reliable information.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.760
Well, let's give YouTube a try.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.560
There must be some well-thought-out and researched explanations of it.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.560
No, because then if you don't identify as either, I don't even know what you would

00:47.560 --> 00:48.560
call him.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.920
How can you not identify as either?

00:49.920 --> 00:53.040
They is not a gender.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.120
Nonbinary isn't nothing.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.320
Nonbinary isn't a thing.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.200
All these fake little genders, they aren't a thing.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.160
What if they don't identify as a human?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
You know what?

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
Okay.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.360
Well, clearly the beginning is way too advanced a place to start.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.200
We're gonna need to work our way up from pre-kindergarten here.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.640
Alright, teacher's gonna need a refill on the juice though.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.320
And a pint of raw ether.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.920
Part negative one.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.320
Pre-kindergarten.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.520
Now I could try yet again to explain that gender is a social and psychological concept,

01:22.520 --> 01:27.240
Well, sex is the term used by biologists to describe an organism's reproductive anatomy.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.680
I can tell you that biological sex itself is a pretty broad and nebulous concept, describing

01:31.680 --> 01:37.240
characteristics ranging from chromosomes to hormones to primary and secondary sexual anatomy,

01:37.240 --> 01:40.680
none of which are strictly binary, and most of which can be altered medically.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.720
And I could point out that the dogmatic insistence on an inflexible gender binary is nothing

01:44.720 --> 01:48.840
more than a deliberate political gesture aimed at denying the existence of people who don't

01:48.840 --> 01:51.100
strictly conform to conventional social roles.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.540
But I know that by this point in the video, a bunch of free-thinking rationalists have

01:54.540 --> 01:58.820
already posted a comment explaining that it's just a simple scientific fact that there are

01:58.820 --> 01:59.820
only two genders.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.960
And you know, you raise a good point.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.660
Why don't we start out with a proper, scientific explanation of gender?

02:05.660 --> 02:06.660
Doctor?

02:06.660 --> 02:20.660
Thank you doctor, that was very informative.

02:20.660 --> 02:26.740
I'm glad we cleared that up.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.880
Part Zero.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.180
Trans and Non-Binary Identities

02:29.180 --> 02:33.500
You're watching this video in the 21st century, so you're presumably aware that transgender

02:33.500 --> 02:34.700
people are a thing.

02:34.700 --> 02:39.100
You've probably heard that certain people are born in the wrong body, and suffer intolerable

02:39.100 --> 02:43.520
dysphoria, the only remedy for which is to undergo hormone replacement therapy and gender

02:43.520 --> 02:47.780
reassignment surgery with the aim of passing as the gender they always knew they truly

02:47.780 --> 02:48.780
felt they were.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.460
It's a story that trans people often have to tell about themselves, in order to be taken

02:52.460 --> 02:56.180
seriously by doctors, and to be understood by the general public.

02:56.180 --> 03:00.100
And while it does describe some trans people's experience, it's by no means the only trans

03:00.100 --> 03:02.620
experience, and it may not even be the most common.

03:02.620 --> 03:06.480
Some trans people only discover their gender identity later in life, some don't experience

03:06.480 --> 03:11.140
dysphoria so intensely, and others, called non-binary people who may or may not consider

03:11.140 --> 03:16.060
themselves trans, identify with neither gender, with both, or with something in between.

03:16.060 --> 03:19.740
Now there are lots of different ways to be non-binary, and there's a lot of terminology

03:19.740 --> 03:21.820
that allows us to make those distinctions.

03:21.820 --> 03:27.620
So for instance, the term genderqueer, which is the term I use for myself as ofâ€¦ now,

03:27.620 --> 03:31.060
is a very broad term that's basically a synonym for non-binary.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.780
More specific terms include agender, which describes people who don't feel they have

03:34.780 --> 03:40.020
a gender at all, genderfluid, people whose gender identity varies over time, androgyne,

03:40.020 --> 03:44.180
people in the middle of the male-female spectrum, and bigender, people who identify with both

03:44.180 --> 03:45.420
ends of the spectrum.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.980
Now if you're fairly new to this topic, and most people are, all of this probably

03:48.980 --> 03:51.060
just sounds like a bunch of fucking made-up nonsense.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.280
I mean, that's what I thought the first few times I heard about it too.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.100
You may be thinking that these terms describe mental states that are impossible or delusional,

03:58.100 --> 04:02.780
cue shitty unoriginal jokes about attack helicopters, or alternately feelings that are universal,

04:02.780 --> 04:06.140
in which case you're probably wondering why we need special terms for feelings that

04:06.140 --> 04:07.380
everyone has.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.820
However, all these reactions are misunderstandings.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.620
Forgivable, but wrong.

04:11.660 --> 04:15.660
If you want to understand better, the best way is to listen more to the specific experiences

04:15.660 --> 04:20.140
of a wide variety of non-binary people, keeping in mind that no two people's experiences

04:20.140 --> 04:21.140
are the same.

04:21.140 --> 04:26.140
So, at the risk of being self-indulgent, we may as well start with your humble narrator.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.180
And besides, gazing deep into the troubled depths of another person's soul is usually

04:30.180 --> 04:35.740
at least good for a laugh, because, well, other people's pain is funny.

04:35.740 --> 04:36.740
Part 1.

04:36.740 --> 04:39.140
My Shameful History of Lying to Myself and My Audience

04:39.140 --> 04:44.540
In the past I've described myself as a cross-dresser, a transvestite, or a degenerate pervert, and

04:44.540 --> 04:48.020
that characterization shows up a lot in my previous videos, which is now coming back

04:48.020 --> 04:49.020
to haunt me.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.540
I'm just an old-fashioned cross-dressing pervert.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.780
Hello there boys and girls, my name is Shrumbly the Transvestite.

04:55.780 --> 04:59.260
Four months ago, before I became the plucky, though dipso, maniacal cross-dresser you know

04:59.260 --> 05:01.700
today, I don't identify as non-binary myself.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.820
In fact, I identify as a mane, which is how Bluesman Muddy Waters pronounces the word

05:05.820 --> 05:06.820
man.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.020
I'm speaking as a mentally ill alcoholic transvestite.

05:09.020 --> 05:12.600
So there are a few different reasons why I use that kind of language.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.460
One is that I've always been kind of hesitant about claiming any kind of queer identity,

05:16.460 --> 05:21.580
because I don't bang dudes, not yet anyway, and I don't own any rainbow flags, and most

05:21.580 --> 05:25.380
of the people I've known who are non-binary are younger than me, usually assigned female

05:25.380 --> 05:29.900
at birth, and they date women or each other, I don't know, it just seemed like the identity

05:29.900 --> 05:31.100
wasn't for me.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.660
Another reason is that I'm just kind of a self-loathing, self-denigrating person, and

05:34.660 --> 05:39.620
I genuinely find it easier to just tell myself and other people that I'm a sexual deviant,

05:39.620 --> 05:42.820
because it's a fun and breezy way to write the whole issue off, and it doesn't lead to

05:42.820 --> 05:45.620
a whole difficult conversation about gender identity.

05:45.620 --> 05:51.020
Also, YouTube is not a safe space, and it's prudent to pre-saturize yourself, to preemptively

05:51.020 --> 05:54.700
say the things a bully might say, thereby robbing them of the fun.

05:54.700 --> 06:00.900
Plus I really value humor, and you know, there's just nothing less funny than self-respect.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.620
And there is a kind of authenticity in the self-denigration too.

06:03.660 --> 06:09.180
In my past videos, I often evoke depictions of femme men as objects of ridicule or disgust,

06:09.180 --> 06:12.020
for instance alluding to Silence of the Lambs or Rocky Horror.

06:12.020 --> 06:16.820
And the truth is that I am kind of disgusted and horrified by myself a lot of the time.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.820
Not proud of that, but it's a thing.

06:18.820 --> 06:23.220
And I know this is probably not the inspiring and affirming message that you're hoping for,

06:23.220 --> 06:29.620
but honestly I'm just not that inspiring of a person, so stop being inspired.

06:29.940 --> 06:34.740
Anyway, I've now reached a point where I think I owe myself, and other nonbinary people,

06:34.740 --> 06:38.340
a little bit better than I've been doing, and have been inspired by a lot of mostly

06:38.340 --> 06:42.980
younger nonbinary people to drop some of this self-denigration and adopt a language that

06:42.980 --> 06:45.780
I think actually affirms the way I feel inside.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.020
Ugh, what is this channel coming to?

06:48.020 --> 06:51.300
I'm talking about my feelings like a fucking queer.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.340
What's next, not drinking myself into a stupor?

06:54.340 --> 06:56.700
Oh shit, my defenses are lowered.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.220
The bullies will make mean videos about me now, noooooo.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.180
The term cross-dresser is very ill-defined.

07:07.180 --> 07:10.500
Basically it refers to anyone who dresses as the opposite sex.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.780
They could do it for fun, for theater, or as a sexual fetish, but essentially they'd

07:14.780 --> 07:18.700
do it as a form of gender expression that's separate from their own gender identity.

07:18.700 --> 07:23.300
Whereas, when I wear makeup or femme clothing, I feel like I'm expressing my own gender.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.060
These aren't women's clothes.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.300
I didn't steal them from a woman, they're mine.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.020
And they're part of my gender expression.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.980
So it's not accurate to call me a cross-dresser, because I'm not a man in women's clothes.

07:34.980 --> 07:35.980
So what am I?

07:35.980 --> 07:37.460
Am I a trans woman?

07:37.460 --> 07:39.340
Well, that's a good question.

07:39.340 --> 07:43.980
I have had mild dysphoria over the years that's sometimes bad enough that I have given serious

07:43.980 --> 07:45.300
thought to transitioning.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.340
I still hate my body hair and facial hair, and I spend a lot of time removing it.

07:49.340 --> 07:50.340
All of it.

07:50.340 --> 07:52.700
And I prefer femme or androgynous gender expression.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.700
But here's the deal.

07:53.860 --> 07:59.100
I'm six foot two, my shoulders are twice as wide as my waist, and I have this voice.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.100
So passing?

08:00.100 --> 08:01.900
It would take a lot of work.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.820
Plus I'm pretty indifferent on the issue of breasts and genitals, and indifference

08:05.820 --> 08:07.660
is not enough to justify surgery.

08:07.660 --> 08:12.460
I have thought about HRT to get that sweet smooth estrogen skin and some alleged emotional

08:12.460 --> 08:17.420
benefits, but you know, it involves a lot of doctors and therapists, and it's not really

08:17.420 --> 08:18.420
my scene.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.420
But it's more than just that.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.800
I actually don't want to surrender some of my masculine attributes.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.920
For instance, I kind of like my voice, and other people like it too.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.960
People respect a masculine voice, and I'm not going to go passing on male privilege

08:29.960 --> 08:31.900
just to be true to myself.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.480
So I feel the term genderqueer best captures what I really am, namely some kind of freakish

08:36.480 --> 08:37.980
hybrid.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.060
Part Three.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.060
Pronouns.

08:50.100 --> 08:54.280
In some languages, like Chinese, there are no gendered pronouns, so in those languages

08:54.280 --> 08:55.800
this wouldn't be an issue.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.500
But English traditionally forces people to use either male or female pronouns.

08:59.500 --> 09:03.060
A lot of nonbinary people choose to use they as a gender neutral pronoun.

09:03.060 --> 09:07.340
Now my experience is especially true with agender people, who don't like the experience

09:07.340 --> 09:09.280
of being gendered one way or another.

09:09.280 --> 09:13.040
Now I'm more on the genderfluid or bigender side of nonbinary, though I don't use any

09:13.040 --> 09:17.640
other term besides genderqueer because I just find these other terms are too specific.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.440
But I don't experience a lack of gender so much as an excess of it, I've just got

09:21.440 --> 09:25.540
too many fucking genders inside me, they're just filling me up deep inside.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.520
So you can call me he or she.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.520
Either is fine.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.040
What I like the most is a rapid, disorienting alternation between the two, but I get that

09:33.040 --> 09:34.360
that's a lot to ask for.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.400
So, you know what, just call me whatever you want.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.520
I'm making this real easy for you.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.720
I'm basically un-misgenderable.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.120
These are just unimportant labels you can just throw around and change whenever you

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
want.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
They're like Pokemon.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.120
Collect all the labels.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
Until June.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.600
Maybe I GODDAMN W-

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
Part 4.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.960
Concluding unscientific postscript.

09:51.960 --> 09:56.640
Oh I get it, you went to grad school, that's hilarious.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.900
So let's end this video by doing a quick shoot-down of what I'm guessing are going

09:59.900 --> 10:04.180
to be the most common objections to who I am.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.180
Objection 1.

10:05.180 --> 10:09.000
Why can't you just dress how you like without a special label, you goddamn snowflake?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.360
Well as I've already said, being genderqueer is about more than just clothes.

10:12.360 --> 10:16.800
It affects how I experience my own body, how I relate to other people, how the world

10:16.800 --> 10:19.920
reacts to me, and even real personal shit.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.520
Like who and how, I wanna BANG.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.440
And when you tell genderqueer people that we shouldn't have a word for ourselves,

10:25.440 --> 10:30.000
you're in effect asking us to drop the banner that allows us to understand ourselves, to

10:30.000 --> 10:33.800
find each other, and to collectively demand recognition and understanding.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.080
So telling us we shouldn't have a label basically amounts to asking us to shut up

10:37.080 --> 10:38.640
and disappear.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
Objection 2.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
You're just doing this for attention.

10:40.920 --> 10:45.120
Well, I do like attention, but the public aspect of this is really just the tip of a

10:45.120 --> 10:49.120
psychological iceberg, so no, that's not correct.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
Objection 3.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.040
This makes you a bad feminist, because gender is a caste system, based on systemic subjugation

10:54.040 --> 10:58.040
of women by men, and not just some identity that you can claim because of how you feel.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.840
Well, can it be both?

10:59.840 --> 11:03.440
Honestly this objection is more likely to come up for nonbinary assigned female and

11:03.440 --> 11:06.960
birth people, since they can be accused of GENDER TREASY.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.560
I'd suggest reading genderqueer feminist Laurie Penny's take on this.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.960
Basically they identify as nonbinary, though also as a political woman, in recognition

11:14.960 --> 11:18.080
of their need to defend female reproductive rights.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.080
Objection 4.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.600
It's just a simple scientific fact that there are only two genders.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.280
And now we've come full circle.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.880
Man, can't I just enjoy parading my new identity around for five minutes without having

11:28.880 --> 11:32.840
to compose a goddamn philosophical excursus justifying myself?
