1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
Well, YouTube, I've been making videos for months now about the most controversial possible

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,820
topics, but recently it seems that only one person has had the god damn balls to make

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,820
a response.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,820
And who's that?

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,980
Well, his name is the distribut- the distribution- look, I'm just gonna call him Chesterton,

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,820
because his avatar is a cartoon of G.K.

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,820
Chesterton.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,420
Now look, Chesterton, we've got beef.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,820
Take a seat, Chesterton, have some grapes.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Try the wine.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,980
I trust you'll find everything sumptuous.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,740
So Chesterton is a Catholic traditionalist YouTuber, and he's made a four-part series

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,020
of videos titled Lies of the Sexual Revolution, featuring Dan Savage, Laci Green, Lena Dunham,

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,020
and me.

15
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,900
Wait, why am I in this video?

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,220
These other people are way more famous than I am.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,820
I guess that's good company.

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,020
I mean, Dan Savage is awesome, Laci Green does a public service, you know, her videos

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,220
aren't really for me, but-

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,420
Why do men think everything has to be for them?

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,460
Laci Green's videos are for naive 16-year-old girls, not jaded 28-year-old perverts, and

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
that's fine.

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,620
Anyway, he's put black bars over our mouths with the word LIES, so that's good.

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,300
In any case, I'm happy to be cast as a promoter of the sexual revolution, so let's do this.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,920
And ladies, you may want to dig that bottle of Prosecco out of the back of the fridge,

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,660
because I'm gonna warn you in advance, this video is gonna be two weird men on the internet

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,860
debating about what kind of sex you should have.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,860
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:02:08,260
So

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,100
Chesterton's got beef with my video about pickup artists, remember, the one about BANG.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,800
And of course, the feminist critique of Don Giovanni has the same problem of all feminist

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,100
critiques of pickup artists.

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,940
Once you acknowledge that consent is the only necessary requirement for it to be good, how

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,220
do you criticize a person who pursues it more earnestly?

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,620
He seems like a less hypocritical version of your everyday person.

36
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,200
Well look, GK, one of your main arguments in this video is that feminists have no ground

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,140
to criticize pickup artists, because you claim they believe that the only requirement for

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,580
good sex is consent.

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,040
But that's not what most feminists believe, not what I believe.

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,540
All consent does is establish that the sex is not rape.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,140
And that, Chesterton, is a very low bar to set, both erotically and ethically speaking,

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,260
and I'm sure you'll agree.

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,080
There's all kinds of ways that consensual sex can be ethically questionable, for instance

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,260
if there's manipulation or deceit involved, or if a person with no emotional involvement

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
exploits someone with a lot of emotional involvement, and so on.

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,140
And pretty much any feminist I know will acknowledge this.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,180
In fact, the raddest of the radfems think that pretty much all sex is problematic, because

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,660
of like, power dynamics.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,360
Even if that's what they're into.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,280
And as it happens, a lot of them are.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,980
The feminist critique of the pickup artist mentality basically says that rouge and company

52
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,300
treat women as a mere means to sex, without any respect for their wishes or humanity.

53
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,840
In my video, I took the ethical issue as read, and basically just bashed rouge for being

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
a bad hedonist.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Because at least seeking pleasure is a worthwhile goal, whereas tabulating your bangs in a futile

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
effort to prop up your needy ego is, um, not.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,400
So I took to Chesterton's comments section, and we had a brief exchange that got pretty

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
personal pretty fast.

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,240
He asked me if I knew how damaging sexual promiscuity could be to my partners, to which

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
I respond that...

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,280
Well, look, if we're talking emotional damages, I mean, there's gonna be emotional damage.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Of course there is.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Of course there's gonna be emotional damage.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,960
We're all gonna be a little bit emotionally damaged, Chesterton.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,800
I'M EMOTIONALLY DAMAGED RIGHT NOW!

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,160
But the good news is that the emotional damage caused by casual sex is really just a kind

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,960
of emptiness of the soul, a feeling of meaninglessness.

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,180
And I, Chesterton, am a veteran of feelings of meaninglessness, which, I mean, wah wah.

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,000
Get drunk in bed for a couple days and get over it.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,840
I mean, if anything, it's romantic love that causes the real damage.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,080
You know, it's the romantic love people who are throwing themselves off bridges and generally

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
behaving like a fucking jackass.

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:11,080
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:26,040
Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, love you forever and evermore.

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.

76
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,040
And to be clear, I am not a sex guru, I am not a love guru, I don't encourage anyone

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
to emulate my terrible behavior.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
I am a person on the threshold of being unable to function in society.

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,680
And to be honest, I find casual sex kind of difficult myself, which is why I need the

80
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
drugs.

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
The drugs, Chesterton!

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,920
You have failed to consider the drugs!

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,880
None of this is possible without the drugs!

84
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
The drugs, Chesterton!

85
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
The drugs!

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,480
You've got your wine, you've got your caffeine pills, your rhinestones.

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,400
The drugs are simply the best way to shut down the garbage emotions.

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
You know, like shame and fear, anxiety, you know, empathy.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,980
That's why the sexual revolution is good for women.

90
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:21,760
If you liked this video, make sure to leave a comment.

91
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm weary of this beef.

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,840
Now, GK has accused me of being glib and insincere, so I guess I better explain what I actually

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
think, huh?

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,720
So basically what I think is that in a free society, different people will choose lots

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,800
of different sexual lifestyles.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,040
Some people will want to settle down and get married, and that's fine.

97
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,380
Some people will want to have a fucking baby, and that's also fine.

98
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,760
Someone needs to have the fucking babies.

99
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,160
But some people won't want to do that.

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,460
Some people will want to dip their balls in hot wax and pour wolves milk all over a stranger's

101
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
face.

102
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,660
And that's fine too.

103
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,620
Some people don't want to have any sexual or romantic relationships.

104
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,580
The point is, all of these things carry emotional risks.

105
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,900
You've got heartbreak, loneliness, excruciating boredom, this is just the human condition.

106
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Heartbreak.

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,380
And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.

108
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,380
Loneliness.

109
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,420
This is just the human condition.

110
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Boredom.

111
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,380
And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.

112
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,700
But as a society, we can make sex less risky for women by ending rape culture and slut

113
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,660
shaming and by instituting all-you-can-eat birth control, hence, you know, feminism.

114
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,300
And there are also things we can do as individuals to be safer, kinder, and more responsible.

115
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,140
If you do choose to have casual sex, things are going to go a lot better for you and your

116
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,900
partners if you try to remain honest, open, and communicative about what your intentions

117
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
are.

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,420
And for God's sake, use a condom.

119
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,220
Do not get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant.

120
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,060
It's a real downer, this echoing God's act of creation by bringing new life into the

121
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
world.

122
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
It's disgusting.

123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,700
Now, speaking of God, there's not really any avoiding the fact that a lot of what separates

124
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,060
my view from GK's on this issue is the whole God issue, but I'm reluctant to say too much

125
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,820
about that because, well, it's come to my attention that there are already two or three

126
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,780
videos on YouTube on the subject of atheism, and I wouldn't want to be redundant.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,660
I don't know, you guys might be in here, I'm not trying to keep up with what I am.

128
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,380
But Chesterton did suggest that I read Pope JP II's lectures on the theology of the body,

129
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,620
so we can take a look at that.

130
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,300
Now, I'm guessing this is going to call for a script and a voiceover, so hit it, Johnson.

131
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,040
So according to a book I read, God created man in his own image, and then he made a chick

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,100
version of the man, and they enjoyed a kind of pure sexuality based on the unity of their

133
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,740
flesh without the corruption of lust, covetousness, or general concupiscence.

134
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,940
And the DUMB FUCKING WOMAN ate the apple, and now everything sucks, because our hearts

135
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,980
are corrupted by sin, and our sexuality is perverted.

136
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,420
But the good news is that we're redeemable, and through the majesty of conjugal love,

137
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,060
we're still capable of recognizing the spiritual essence of God made visible in the form of

138
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,660
the human body, and the unity of our nuptial flesh parts.

139
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Makin' babies.

140
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Uh-huh.

141
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,700
Johnson, that was very glib and sarcastic.

142
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,460
Let the record show I don't approve of that sort of thing.

143
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,660
Anyway, um, desert anyone?

144
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:25,960
I meant to get a desert thing today before filming, but I forgot.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,300
So eat your fuckin' beans.

146
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,900
So actually, there are some things about the theology of the body that I kind of agree

147
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
with.

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,700
I agree that there's something a little bit messed up about lust.

149
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,200
And by lust, I don't mean just sexual attraction in itself.

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,420
I mean this kind of creepy, covetous, gawking-it TNA on the subway platform, raw desire to

151
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,900
possess another human being.

152
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,420
I mean, what kind of a thing is that to want?

153
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,460
You know, it's creepy, it's intrusive, it's unpleasant, I don't care for it.

154
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,800
So, granted.

155
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,080
The other thing I like is the idea that the sexual attraction to a human body is actually

156
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,340
the lesser manifestation of a higher longing.

157
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,540
There's a famous quote, often misattributed to the historical GK Chesterton, that goes,

158
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,460
The man who rings the door at the brothel unconsciously does so seeking God.

159
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,420
Now this is really a platonic idea.

160
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,780
In the symposium, Plato talks about the highest form of love is the contemplation of the beautiful

161
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,300
bodies of young boys.

162
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,860
That's what he says.

163
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,000
The fuckin' petar ass.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,580
The idea is that the contemplation of the beauty of physical bodies will lead to the

165
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,260
more refined contemplation of beauty itself.

166
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,580
And I'm not really with Plato on the details here, and I'm not with the Catholics either.

167
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,140
They're being too specific, but I would agree with the general idea that carnal desire

168
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,300
contains a longing for something beyond merely coming in or around another person.

169
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,740
There's an urge behind the sexual urge for a kind of transcendence, which may be why

170
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,380
the naked body features so often an art.

171
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,400
And to me, a person apparently deaf to the voice of God, transcendence lies in the little

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,220
spine-tingling moments where I feel elevated above ordinary human experience.

173
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,700
It's watching dabs of paint resolve into interplay of sunlight and shadow.

174
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,740
It's the peak of a sweet fuckin' guitar solo.

175
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,340
It's the ability to regard the sadness and desperation of human life with simultaneous

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,980
horror and humor.

177
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,920
And in a sense, this is only the illusion of transcendence, since I'm not really getting

178
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,520
outside of human experience, I'm just pushing it to the limit.

179
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,340
But as I see it, all transcendence is an illusion.

180
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,980
There is no reaching beyond human consciousness.

181
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,940
But at least in my illusion, there's a kind of liberation from mere biology, unlike JP's

182
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,540
procreative conjugal love transcendence or the Golden One's procreative racialist transcendence.

183
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,620
The problem with you guys is you're obsessed with sex and procreation.

184
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,380
Am I the only genuine goddamn spiritualist around here?

185
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Social conservatives, with their fixation on suppressing individual urges for the good

186
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,220
of the species, are starting to sound like a bunch of crypto-Darwinists.

187
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,440
Whereas I, for one, believe the individual human spirit can aspire to something higher.

188
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,460
And that is why I'm not, at heart, really a hedonist.

189
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,060
Racism is only a good philosophy for 3 to 4 hours at a time, maybe with the right drugs

190
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,740
as much as 10 to 12.

191
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
But that's it.

192
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,020
That's the limit on the intervals of pleasure.

193
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,900
And when you wake up from the crash, you're going to need another reason to not die.

194
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,320
So that's the point of transcendence, and also, you know, friends.

195
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,900
And the crash can be mitigated too.

196
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,940
You know, I have to wonder how much of social conservatives' horror and disdain for degeneracy

197
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,500
stems from their own feelings of shame and self-loathing that, with the right conditioning,

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
they could overcome.

199
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,500
So for instance, the Golden One, and yes I am obsessed with him and I do spend all my

200
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,320
time thinking about him, has been on this no-fap kick lately to preserve his masculine

201
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,100
vitality or whatever, and a lot of guys are getting into this now.

202
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,660
I don't know what it is about humans, we apparently just love coming up with reasons

203
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,380
to make ourselves not come.

204
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,100
But I think I've got a different solution, fellas, and you can consider this homework.

205
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,660
So the next time you cave, and you will, and indulge in a session of clammy self-abuse,

206
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,700
why don't you try listening to classical music?

207
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,460
I think you'll find that the highbrow associations will stave off feelings of degeneracy.

208
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,140
Choose something with a solo violin, maybe.

209
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,100
Yes, the cellos underneath are your heartbeat, the veritable life pulse.

210
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,020
I want you to focus your rising passion on the thread of the violin.

211
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,260
That is your moan of ecstasy, the song of your soul.

212
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,380
You can start using your imagination now.

213
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,100
Think about whatever you're into.

214
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,580
Yeah.

215
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,100
Yeah.

216
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't lose the melody, though.

217
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,860
You're going to want to peak with a trill and cadence.

218
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,380
Oh yeah.

219
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,980
Oh yeah.

220
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
Fuck.

221
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
And that's, uh, the meaning of life.

222
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,580
So checkmate, Catholics.

223
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,020

227
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,300
be able to do videos like this without that support, so a huge thanks goes out to
