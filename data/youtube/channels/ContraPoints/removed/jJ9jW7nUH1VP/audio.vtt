00:00.000 --> 00:18.360
Well, YouTube, I've been making videos for months now about the most controversial possible

00:18.360 --> 00:23.820
topics, but recently it seems that only one person has had the god damn balls to make

00:23.820 --> 00:24.820
a response.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.820
And who's that?

00:25.820 --> 00:31.980
Well, his name is the distribut- the distribution- look, I'm just gonna call him Chesterton,

00:31.980 --> 00:33.820
because his avatar is a cartoon of G.K.

00:33.820 --> 00:34.820
Chesterton.

00:34.820 --> 00:42.420
Now look, Chesterton, we've got beef.

00:42.420 --> 00:46.820
Take a seat, Chesterton, have some grapes.

00:46.820 --> 00:48.820
Try the wine.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.980
I trust you'll find everything sumptuous.

00:53.980 --> 00:57.740
So Chesterton is a Catholic traditionalist YouTuber, and he's made a four-part series

00:57.740 --> 01:04.020
of videos titled Lies of the Sexual Revolution, featuring Dan Savage, Laci Green, Lena Dunham,

01:04.020 --> 01:05.020
and me.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.900
Wait, why am I in this video?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.220
These other people are way more famous than I am.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.820
I guess that's good company.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.020
I mean, Dan Savage is awesome, Laci Green does a public service, you know, her videos

01:15.020 --> 01:16.220
aren't really for me, but-

01:16.220 --> 01:18.420
Why do men think everything has to be for them?

01:18.420 --> 01:23.460
Laci Green's videos are for naive 16-year-old girls, not jaded 28-year-old perverts, and

01:23.460 --> 01:24.460
that's fine.

01:24.460 --> 01:28.620
Anyway, he's put black bars over our mouths with the word LIES, so that's good.

01:28.620 --> 01:33.300
In any case, I'm happy to be cast as a promoter of the sexual revolution, so let's do this.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.920
And ladies, you may want to dig that bottle of Prosecco out of the back of the fridge,

01:36.920 --> 01:40.660
because I'm gonna warn you in advance, this video is gonna be two weird men on the internet

01:40.660 --> 01:42.860
debating about what kind of sex you should have.

01:42.860 --> 01:43.860
I'm so sorry.

01:43.860 --> 02:08.260
So

02:08.260 --> 02:13.100
Chesterton's got beef with my video about pickup artists, remember, the one about BANG.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.800
And of course, the feminist critique of Don Giovanni has the same problem of all feminist

02:17.800 --> 02:20.100
critiques of pickup artists.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.940
Once you acknowledge that consent is the only necessary requirement for it to be good, how

02:24.940 --> 02:28.220
do you criticize a person who pursues it more earnestly?

02:28.220 --> 02:31.620
He seems like a less hypocritical version of your everyday person.

02:31.620 --> 02:36.200
Well look, GK, one of your main arguments in this video is that feminists have no ground

02:36.200 --> 02:40.140
to criticize pickup artists, because you claim they believe that the only requirement for

02:40.140 --> 02:41.580
good sex is consent.

02:41.580 --> 02:45.040
But that's not what most feminists believe, not what I believe.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.540
All consent does is establish that the sex is not rape.

02:48.540 --> 02:53.140
And that, Chesterton, is a very low bar to set, both erotically and ethically speaking,

02:53.140 --> 02:54.260
and I'm sure you'll agree.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.080
There's all kinds of ways that consensual sex can be ethically questionable, for instance

02:58.080 --> 03:02.260
if there's manipulation or deceit involved, or if a person with no emotional involvement

03:02.260 --> 03:05.260
exploits someone with a lot of emotional involvement, and so on.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.140
And pretty much any feminist I know will acknowledge this.

03:08.180 --> 03:12.180
In fact, the raddest of the radfems think that pretty much all sex is problematic, because

03:12.180 --> 03:13.660
of like, power dynamics.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.360
Even if that's what they're into.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.280
And as it happens, a lot of them are.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.980
The feminist critique of the pickup artist mentality basically says that rouge and company

03:21.980 --> 03:26.300
treat women as a mere means to sex, without any respect for their wishes or humanity.

03:26.300 --> 03:30.840
In my video, I took the ethical issue as read, and basically just bashed rouge for being

03:30.840 --> 03:32.320
a bad hedonist.

03:32.320 --> 03:37.800
Because at least seeking pleasure is a worthwhile goal, whereas tabulating your bangs in a futile

03:37.800 --> 03:41.800
effort to prop up your needy ego is, um, not.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.400
So I took to Chesterton's comments section, and we had a brief exchange that got pretty

03:45.400 --> 03:47.200
personal pretty fast.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.240
He asked me if I knew how damaging sexual promiscuity could be to my partners, to which

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
I respond that...

03:58.800 --> 04:03.280
Well, look, if we're talking emotional damages, I mean, there's gonna be emotional damage.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.280
Of course there is.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.080
Of course there's gonna be emotional damage.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.960
We're all gonna be a little bit emotionally damaged, Chesterton.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.800
I'M EMOTIONALLY DAMAGED RIGHT NOW!

04:14.280 --> 04:18.160
But the good news is that the emotional damage caused by casual sex is really just a kind

04:18.160 --> 04:21.960
of emptiness of the soul, a feeling of meaninglessness.

04:21.960 --> 04:27.180
And I, Chesterton, am a veteran of feelings of meaninglessness, which, I mean, wah wah.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.000
Get drunk in bed for a couple days and get over it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.840
I mean, if anything, it's romantic love that causes the real damage.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.080
You know, it's the romantic love people who are throwing themselves off bridges and generally

04:37.080 --> 04:38.520
behaving like a fucking jackass.

05:02.840 --> 05:11.080
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.

05:11.080 --> 05:26.040
Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, love you forever and evermore.

05:26.040 --> 05:37.720
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.040
And to be clear, I am not a sex guru, I am not a love guru, I don't encourage anyone

05:42.040 --> 05:43.600
to emulate my terrible behavior.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.120
I am a person on the threshold of being unable to function in society.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.680
And to be honest, I find casual sex kind of difficult myself, which is why I need the

05:50.680 --> 05:51.680
drugs.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
The drugs, Chesterton!

05:52.680 --> 05:53.920
You have failed to consider the drugs!

05:53.920 --> 05:55.880
None of this is possible without the drugs!

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
The drugs, Chesterton!

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
The drugs!

05:57.880 --> 06:01.480
You've got your wine, you've got your caffeine pills, your rhinestones.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.400
The drugs are simply the best way to shut down the garbage emotions.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.800
You know, like shame and fear, anxiety, you know, empathy.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.980
That's why the sexual revolution is good for women.

06:10.980 --> 06:21.760
If you liked this video, make sure to leave a comment.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.800
I'm weary of this beef.

06:24.720 --> 06:30.840
Now, GK has accused me of being glib and insincere, so I guess I better explain what I actually

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
think, huh?

06:31.840 --> 06:35.720
So basically what I think is that in a free society, different people will choose lots

06:35.720 --> 06:37.800
of different sexual lifestyles.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.040
Some people will want to settle down and get married, and that's fine.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.380
Some people will want to have a fucking baby, and that's also fine.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.760
Someone needs to have the fucking babies.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.160
But some people won't want to do that.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.460
Some people will want to dip their balls in hot wax and pour wolves milk all over a stranger's

06:52.460 --> 06:53.460
face.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.660
And that's fine too.

06:54.660 --> 06:57.620
Some people don't want to have any sexual or romantic relationships.

06:57.620 --> 07:01.580
The point is, all of these things carry emotional risks.

07:01.580 --> 07:07.900
You've got heartbreak, loneliness, excruciating boredom, this is just the human condition.

07:07.900 --> 07:08.900
Heartbreak.

07:08.900 --> 07:13.380
And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.380
Loneliness.

07:14.380 --> 07:17.420
This is just the human condition.

07:17.420 --> 07:18.420
Boredom.

07:18.420 --> 07:22.380
And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.

07:22.380 --> 07:28.700
But as a society, we can make sex less risky for women by ending rape culture and slut

07:28.700 --> 07:33.660
shaming and by instituting all-you-can-eat birth control, hence, you know, feminism.

07:33.660 --> 07:38.300
And there are also things we can do as individuals to be safer, kinder, and more responsible.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.140
If you do choose to have casual sex, things are going to go a lot better for you and your

07:42.140 --> 07:46.900
partners if you try to remain honest, open, and communicative about what your intentions

07:46.900 --> 07:47.900
are.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.420
And for God's sake, use a condom.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.220
Do not get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant.

07:52.220 --> 07:57.060
It's a real downer, this echoing God's act of creation by bringing new life into the

07:57.060 --> 07:58.060
world.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.060
It's disgusting.

07:59.060 --> 08:04.700
Now, speaking of God, there's not really any avoiding the fact that a lot of what separates

08:04.700 --> 08:10.060
my view from GK's on this issue is the whole God issue, but I'm reluctant to say too much

08:10.060 --> 08:14.820
about that because, well, it's come to my attention that there are already two or three

08:14.820 --> 08:18.780
videos on YouTube on the subject of atheism, and I wouldn't want to be redundant.

08:19.440 --> 08:24.660
I don't know, you guys might be in here, I'm not trying to keep up with what I am.

08:24.660 --> 08:29.380
But Chesterton did suggest that I read Pope JP II's lectures on the theology of the body,

08:29.380 --> 08:30.620
so we can take a look at that.

08:30.620 --> 08:36.300
Now, I'm guessing this is going to call for a script and a voiceover, so hit it, Johnson.

08:36.300 --> 08:40.040
So according to a book I read, God created man in his own image, and then he made a chick

08:40.040 --> 08:44.100
version of the man, and they enjoyed a kind of pure sexuality based on the unity of their

08:44.100 --> 08:48.740
flesh without the corruption of lust, covetousness, or general concupiscence.

08:48.740 --> 08:52.940
And the DUMB FUCKING WOMAN ate the apple, and now everything sucks, because our hearts

08:52.940 --> 08:55.980
are corrupted by sin, and our sexuality is perverted.

08:55.980 --> 09:00.420
But the good news is that we're redeemable, and through the majesty of conjugal love,

09:00.420 --> 09:05.060
we're still capable of recognizing the spiritual essence of God made visible in the form of

09:05.060 --> 09:08.660
the human body, and the unity of our nuptial flesh parts.

09:08.660 --> 09:09.660
Makin' babies.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.660
Uh-huh.

09:10.660 --> 09:13.700
Johnson, that was very glib and sarcastic.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.460
Let the record show I don't approve of that sort of thing.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.660
Anyway, um, desert anyone?

09:18.660 --> 09:25.960
I meant to get a desert thing today before filming, but I forgot.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.300
So eat your fuckin' beans.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.900
So actually, there are some things about the theology of the body that I kind of agree

09:30.900 --> 09:31.900
with.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.700
I agree that there's something a little bit messed up about lust.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.200
And by lust, I don't mean just sexual attraction in itself.

09:38.200 --> 09:44.420
I mean this kind of creepy, covetous, gawking-it TNA on the subway platform, raw desire to

09:44.420 --> 09:45.900
possess another human being.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.420
I mean, what kind of a thing is that to want?

09:48.420 --> 09:53.460
You know, it's creepy, it's intrusive, it's unpleasant, I don't care for it.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.800
So, granted.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.080
The other thing I like is the idea that the sexual attraction to a human body is actually

09:59.080 --> 10:01.340
the lesser manifestation of a higher longing.

10:01.340 --> 10:06.540
There's a famous quote, often misattributed to the historical GK Chesterton, that goes,

10:06.540 --> 10:10.460
The man who rings the door at the brothel unconsciously does so seeking God.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.420
Now this is really a platonic idea.

10:12.420 --> 10:17.780
In the symposium, Plato talks about the highest form of love is the contemplation of the beautiful

10:17.780 --> 10:19.300
bodies of young boys.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.860
That's what he says.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.000
The fuckin' petar ass.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.580
The idea is that the contemplation of the beauty of physical bodies will lead to the

10:27.580 --> 10:30.260
more refined contemplation of beauty itself.

10:30.260 --> 10:34.580
And I'm not really with Plato on the details here, and I'm not with the Catholics either.

10:34.580 --> 10:39.140
They're being too specific, but I would agree with the general idea that carnal desire

10:39.140 --> 10:44.300
contains a longing for something beyond merely coming in or around another person.

10:44.300 --> 10:49.740
There's an urge behind the sexual urge for a kind of transcendence, which may be why

10:49.740 --> 10:52.380
the naked body features so often an art.

10:52.380 --> 10:57.400
And to me, a person apparently deaf to the voice of God, transcendence lies in the little

10:57.400 --> 11:02.220
spine-tingling moments where I feel elevated above ordinary human experience.

11:02.220 --> 11:06.700
It's watching dabs of paint resolve into interplay of sunlight and shadow.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.740
It's the peak of a sweet fuckin' guitar solo.

11:09.740 --> 11:14.340
It's the ability to regard the sadness and desperation of human life with simultaneous

11:14.340 --> 11:15.980
horror and humor.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.920
And in a sense, this is only the illusion of transcendence, since I'm not really getting

11:19.920 --> 11:23.520
outside of human experience, I'm just pushing it to the limit.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.340
But as I see it, all transcendence is an illusion.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.980
There is no reaching beyond human consciousness.

11:28.980 --> 11:33.940
But at least in my illusion, there's a kind of liberation from mere biology, unlike JP's

11:33.940 --> 11:39.540
procreative conjugal love transcendence or the Golden One's procreative racialist transcendence.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.620
The problem with you guys is you're obsessed with sex and procreation.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.380
Am I the only genuine goddamn spiritualist around here?

11:46.380 --> 11:50.020
Social conservatives, with their fixation on suppressing individual urges for the good

11:50.020 --> 11:54.220
of the species, are starting to sound like a bunch of crypto-Darwinists.

11:54.220 --> 11:59.440
Whereas I, for one, believe the individual human spirit can aspire to something higher.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.460
And that is why I'm not, at heart, really a hedonist.

12:03.500 --> 12:08.060
Racism is only a good philosophy for 3 to 4 hours at a time, maybe with the right drugs

12:08.060 --> 12:09.740
as much as 10 to 12.

12:09.740 --> 12:10.740
But that's it.

12:10.740 --> 12:13.020
That's the limit on the intervals of pleasure.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.900
And when you wake up from the crash, you're going to need another reason to not die.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.320
So that's the point of transcendence, and also, you know, friends.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.900
And the crash can be mitigated too.

12:21.900 --> 12:26.940
You know, I have to wonder how much of social conservatives' horror and disdain for degeneracy

12:26.940 --> 12:31.500
stems from their own feelings of shame and self-loathing that, with the right conditioning,

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
they could overcome.

12:32.540 --> 12:36.500
So for instance, the Golden One, and yes I am obsessed with him and I do spend all my

12:36.500 --> 12:41.320
time thinking about him, has been on this no-fap kick lately to preserve his masculine

12:41.320 --> 12:45.100
vitality or whatever, and a lot of guys are getting into this now.

12:45.100 --> 12:48.660
I don't know what it is about humans, we apparently just love coming up with reasons

12:48.660 --> 12:50.380
to make ourselves not come.

12:50.380 --> 12:54.100
But I think I've got a different solution, fellas, and you can consider this homework.

12:54.100 --> 12:58.660
So the next time you cave, and you will, and indulge in a session of clammy self-abuse,

12:58.660 --> 13:01.700
why don't you try listening to classical music?

13:01.740 --> 13:06.460
I think you'll find that the highbrow associations will stave off feelings of degeneracy.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.140
Choose something with a solo violin, maybe.

13:09.140 --> 13:14.100
Yes, the cellos underneath are your heartbeat, the veritable life pulse.

13:14.100 --> 13:18.020
I want you to focus your rising passion on the thread of the violin.

13:18.020 --> 13:21.260
That is your moan of ecstasy, the song of your soul.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.380
You can start using your imagination now.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.100
Think about whatever you're into.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.580
Yeah.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.100
Yeah.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.700
Don't lose the melody, though.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.860
You're going to want to peak with a trill and cadence.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.380
Oh yeah.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.980
Oh yeah.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.580
Fuck.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.580
And that's, uh, the meaning of life.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.580
So checkmate, Catholics.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.020
Well thanks for watching my video.

13:56.020 --> 14:00.260
Check the video description for my social media links, including my new livestream channel,

14:00.260 --> 14:04.100
which you should subscribe to if you want notifications about my livestreams.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.500
Thanks to my amazing patrons, I'm now doing this full-time, and I definitely wouldn't

14:07.500 --> 14:11.300
be able to do videos like this without that support, so a huge thanks goes out to

14:30.260 --> 14:38.140

14:56.500 --> 14:57.460
Also, I'm so sorry.
