0	18360	Well, YouTube, I've been making videos for months now about the most controversial possible
18360	23820	topics, but recently it seems that only one person has had the god damn balls to make
23820	24820	a response.
24820	25820	And who's that?
25820	31980	Well, his name is the distribut- the distribution- look, I'm just gonna call him Chesterton,
31980	33820	because his avatar is a cartoon of G.K.
33820	34820	Chesterton.
34820	42420	Now look, Chesterton, we've got beef.
42420	46820	Take a seat, Chesterton, have some grapes.
46820	48820	Try the wine.
48820	53980	I trust you'll find everything sumptuous.
53980	57740	So Chesterton is a Catholic traditionalist YouTuber, and he's made a four-part series
57740	64020	of videos titled Lies of the Sexual Revolution, featuring Dan Savage, Laci Green, Lena Dunham,
64020	65020	and me.
65020	66900	Wait, why am I in this video?
66900	69220	These other people are way more famous than I am.
69220	70820	I guess that's good company.
70820	75020	I mean, Dan Savage is awesome, Laci Green does a public service, you know, her videos
75020	76220	aren't really for me, but-
76220	78420	Why do men think everything has to be for them?
78420	83460	Laci Green's videos are for naive 16-year-old girls, not jaded 28-year-old perverts, and
83460	84460	that's fine.
84460	88620	Anyway, he's put black bars over our mouths with the word LIES, so that's good.
88620	93300	In any case, I'm happy to be cast as a promoter of the sexual revolution, so let's do this.
93300	96920	And ladies, you may want to dig that bottle of Prosecco out of the back of the fridge,
96920	100660	because I'm gonna warn you in advance, this video is gonna be two weird men on the internet
100660	102860	debating about what kind of sex you should have.
102860	103860	I'm so sorry.
103860	128260	So
128260	133100	Chesterton's got beef with my video about pickup artists, remember, the one about BANG.
133100	137800	And of course, the feminist critique of Don Giovanni has the same problem of all feminist
137800	140100	critiques of pickup artists.
140100	144940	Once you acknowledge that consent is the only necessary requirement for it to be good, how
144940	148220	do you criticize a person who pursues it more earnestly?
148220	151620	He seems like a less hypocritical version of your everyday person.
151620	156200	Well look, GK, one of your main arguments in this video is that feminists have no ground
156200	160140	to criticize pickup artists, because you claim they believe that the only requirement for
160140	161580	good sex is consent.
161580	165040	But that's not what most feminists believe, not what I believe.
165040	168540	All consent does is establish that the sex is not rape.
168540	173140	And that, Chesterton, is a very low bar to set, both erotically and ethically speaking,
173140	174260	and I'm sure you'll agree.
174260	178080	There's all kinds of ways that consensual sex can be ethically questionable, for instance
178080	182260	if there's manipulation or deceit involved, or if a person with no emotional involvement
182260	185260	exploits someone with a lot of emotional involvement, and so on.
185260	188140	And pretty much any feminist I know will acknowledge this.
188180	192180	In fact, the raddest of the radfems think that pretty much all sex is problematic, because
192180	193660	of like, power dynamics.
193660	196360	Even if that's what they're into.
196360	198280	And as it happens, a lot of them are.
198280	201980	The feminist critique of the pickup artist mentality basically says that rouge and company
201980	206300	treat women as a mere means to sex, without any respect for their wishes or humanity.
206300	210840	In my video, I took the ethical issue as read, and basically just bashed rouge for being
210840	212320	a bad hedonist.
212320	217800	Because at least seeking pleasure is a worthwhile goal, whereas tabulating your bangs in a futile
217800	221800	effort to prop up your needy ego is, um, not.
221800	225400	So I took to Chesterton's comments section, and we had a brief exchange that got pretty
225400	227200	personal pretty fast.
227200	231240	He asked me if I knew how damaging sexual promiscuity could be to my partners, to which
231240	232240	I respond that...
238800	243280	Well, look, if we're talking emotional damages, I mean, there's gonna be emotional damage.
243280	244280	Of course there is.
244280	246080	Of course there's gonna be emotional damage.
246080	248960	We're all gonna be a little bit emotionally damaged, Chesterton.
248960	250800	I'M EMOTIONALLY DAMAGED RIGHT NOW!
254280	258160	But the good news is that the emotional damage caused by casual sex is really just a kind
258160	261960	of emptiness of the soul, a feeling of meaninglessness.
261960	267180	And I, Chesterton, am a veteran of feelings of meaninglessness, which, I mean, wah wah.
267180	270000	Get drunk in bed for a couple days and get over it.
270000	272840	I mean, if anything, it's romantic love that causes the real damage.
273160	277080	You know, it's the romantic love people who are throwing themselves off bridges and generally
277080	278520	behaving like a fucking jackass.
302840	311080	I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
311080	326040	Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore, love you forever and evermore.
326040	337720	I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
337720	342040	And to be clear, I am not a sex guru, I am not a love guru, I don't encourage anyone
342040	343600	to emulate my terrible behavior.
343600	347120	I am a person on the threshold of being unable to function in society.
347120	350680	And to be honest, I find casual sex kind of difficult myself, which is why I need the
350680	351680	drugs.
351680	352680	The drugs, Chesterton!
352680	353920	You have failed to consider the drugs!
353920	355880	None of this is possible without the drugs!
355880	356880	The drugs, Chesterton!
356880	357880	The drugs!
357880	361480	You've got your wine, you've got your caffeine pills, your rhinestones.
361480	364400	The drugs are simply the best way to shut down the garbage emotions.
364400	368800	You know, like shame and fear, anxiety, you know, empathy.
368800	370980	That's why the sexual revolution is good for women.
370980	381760	If you liked this video, make sure to leave a comment.
381760	383800	I'm weary of this beef.
384720	390840	Now, GK has accused me of being glib and insincere, so I guess I better explain what I actually
390840	391840	think, huh?
391840	395720	So basically what I think is that in a free society, different people will choose lots
395720	397800	of different sexual lifestyles.
397800	401040	Some people will want to settle down and get married, and that's fine.
401040	404380	Some people will want to have a fucking baby, and that's also fine.
404380	405760	Someone needs to have the fucking babies.
405760	408160	But some people won't want to do that.
408160	412460	Some people will want to dip their balls in hot wax and pour wolves milk all over a stranger's
412460	413460	face.
413460	414660	And that's fine too.
414660	417620	Some people don't want to have any sexual or romantic relationships.
417620	421580	The point is, all of these things carry emotional risks.
421580	427900	You've got heartbreak, loneliness, excruciating boredom, this is just the human condition.
427900	428900	Heartbreak.
428900	433380	And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.
433380	434380	Loneliness.
434380	437420	This is just the human condition.
437420	438420	Boredom.
438420	442380	And no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.
442380	448700	But as a society, we can make sex less risky for women by ending rape culture and slut
448700	453660	shaming and by instituting all-you-can-eat birth control, hence, you know, feminism.
453660	458300	And there are also things we can do as individuals to be safer, kinder, and more responsible.
458300	462140	If you do choose to have casual sex, things are going to go a lot better for you and your
462140	466900	partners if you try to remain honest, open, and communicative about what your intentions
466900	467900	are.
467900	469420	And for God's sake, use a condom.
469420	472220	Do not get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant.
472220	477060	It's a real downer, this echoing God's act of creation by bringing new life into the
477060	478060	world.
478060	479060	It's disgusting.
479060	484700	Now, speaking of God, there's not really any avoiding the fact that a lot of what separates
484700	490060	my view from GK's on this issue is the whole God issue, but I'm reluctant to say too much
490060	494820	about that because, well, it's come to my attention that there are already two or three
494820	498780	videos on YouTube on the subject of atheism, and I wouldn't want to be redundant.
499440	504660	I don't know, you guys might be in here, I'm not trying to keep up with what I am.
504660	509380	But Chesterton did suggest that I read Pope JP II's lectures on the theology of the body,
509380	510620	so we can take a look at that.
510620	516300	Now, I'm guessing this is going to call for a script and a voiceover, so hit it, Johnson.
516300	520040	So according to a book I read, God created man in his own image, and then he made a chick
520040	524100	version of the man, and they enjoyed a kind of pure sexuality based on the unity of their
524100	528740	flesh without the corruption of lust, covetousness, or general concupiscence.
528740	532940	And the DUMB FUCKING WOMAN ate the apple, and now everything sucks, because our hearts
532940	535980	are corrupted by sin, and our sexuality is perverted.
535980	540420	But the good news is that we're redeemable, and through the majesty of conjugal love,
540420	545060	we're still capable of recognizing the spiritual essence of God made visible in the form of
545060	548660	the human body, and the unity of our nuptial flesh parts.
548660	549660	Makin' babies.
549660	550660	Uh-huh.
550660	553700	Johnson, that was very glib and sarcastic.
553700	556460	Let the record show I don't approve of that sort of thing.
556460	558660	Anyway, um, desert anyone?
558660	565960	I meant to get a desert thing today before filming, but I forgot.
565960	567300	So eat your fuckin' beans.
567300	570900	So actually, there are some things about the theology of the body that I kind of agree
570900	571900	with.
571900	574700	I agree that there's something a little bit messed up about lust.
574700	578200	And by lust, I don't mean just sexual attraction in itself.
578200	584420	I mean this kind of creepy, covetous, gawking-it TNA on the subway platform, raw desire to
584420	585900	possess another human being.
585900	588420	I mean, what kind of a thing is that to want?
588420	593460	You know, it's creepy, it's intrusive, it's unpleasant, I don't care for it.
593460	594800	So, granted.
594800	599080	The other thing I like is the idea that the sexual attraction to a human body is actually
599080	601340	the lesser manifestation of a higher longing.
601340	606540	There's a famous quote, often misattributed to the historical GK Chesterton, that goes,
606540	610460	The man who rings the door at the brothel unconsciously does so seeking God.
610460	612420	Now this is really a platonic idea.
612420	617780	In the symposium, Plato talks about the highest form of love is the contemplation of the beautiful
617780	619300	bodies of young boys.
619300	621860	That's what he says.
621860	624000	The fuckin' petar ass.
624000	627580	The idea is that the contemplation of the beauty of physical bodies will lead to the
627580	630260	more refined contemplation of beauty itself.
630260	634580	And I'm not really with Plato on the details here, and I'm not with the Catholics either.
634580	639140	They're being too specific, but I would agree with the general idea that carnal desire
639140	644300	contains a longing for something beyond merely coming in or around another person.
644300	649740	There's an urge behind the sexual urge for a kind of transcendence, which may be why
649740	652380	the naked body features so often an art.
652380	657400	And to me, a person apparently deaf to the voice of God, transcendence lies in the little
657400	662220	spine-tingling moments where I feel elevated above ordinary human experience.
662220	666700	It's watching dabs of paint resolve into interplay of sunlight and shadow.
666700	669740	It's the peak of a sweet fuckin' guitar solo.
669740	674340	It's the ability to regard the sadness and desperation of human life with simultaneous
674340	675980	horror and humor.
675980	679920	And in a sense, this is only the illusion of transcendence, since I'm not really getting
679920	683520	outside of human experience, I'm just pushing it to the limit.
683520	686340	But as I see it, all transcendence is an illusion.
686340	688980	There is no reaching beyond human consciousness.
688980	693940	But at least in my illusion, there's a kind of liberation from mere biology, unlike JP's
693940	699540	procreative conjugal love transcendence or the Golden One's procreative racialist transcendence.
699540	702620	The problem with you guys is you're obsessed with sex and procreation.
702620	706380	Am I the only genuine goddamn spiritualist around here?
706380	710020	Social conservatives, with their fixation on suppressing individual urges for the good
710020	714220	of the species, are starting to sound like a bunch of crypto-Darwinists.
714220	719440	Whereas I, for one, believe the individual human spirit can aspire to something higher.
719440	723460	And that is why I'm not, at heart, really a hedonist.
723500	728060	Racism is only a good philosophy for 3 to 4 hours at a time, maybe with the right drugs
728060	729740	as much as 10 to 12.
729740	730740	But that's it.
730740	733020	That's the limit on the intervals of pleasure.
733020	736900	And when you wake up from the crash, you're going to need another reason to not die.
736900	740320	So that's the point of transcendence, and also, you know, friends.
740320	741900	And the crash can be mitigated too.
741900	746940	You know, I have to wonder how much of social conservatives' horror and disdain for degeneracy
746940	751500	stems from their own feelings of shame and self-loathing that, with the right conditioning,
751500	752500	they could overcome.
752540	756500	So for instance, the Golden One, and yes I am obsessed with him and I do spend all my
756500	761320	time thinking about him, has been on this no-fap kick lately to preserve his masculine
761320	765100	vitality or whatever, and a lot of guys are getting into this now.
765100	768660	I don't know what it is about humans, we apparently just love coming up with reasons
768660	770380	to make ourselves not come.
770380	774100	But I think I've got a different solution, fellas, and you can consider this homework.
774100	778660	So the next time you cave, and you will, and indulge in a session of clammy self-abuse,
778660	781700	why don't you try listening to classical music?
781740	786460	I think you'll find that the highbrow associations will stave off feelings of degeneracy.
786460	789140	Choose something with a solo violin, maybe.
789140	794100	Yes, the cellos underneath are your heartbeat, the veritable life pulse.
794100	798020	I want you to focus your rising passion on the thread of the violin.
798020	801260	That is your moan of ecstasy, the song of your soul.
801260	803380	You can start using your imagination now.
803380	806100	Think about whatever you're into.
806100	807580	Yeah.
807580	809100	Yeah.
809100	810700	Don't lose the melody, though.
810740	813860	You're going to want to peak with a trill and cadence.
813860	815380	Oh yeah.
815380	816980	Oh yeah.
816980	818580	Fuck.
823580	825580	And that's, uh, the meaning of life.
825580	828580	So checkmate, Catholics.
834100	836020	Well thanks for watching my video.
