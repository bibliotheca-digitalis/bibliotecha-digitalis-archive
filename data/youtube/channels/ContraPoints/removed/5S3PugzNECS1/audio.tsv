0	27680	So in a way I regard it as beneath my dignity to make a video about Milo Yiannopoulos, but
27680	31440	some things being beneath my dignity has never been enough to stop me before, and it certainly
31440	32840	isn't going to stop me now.
32840	36920	I say beneath my dignity because I don't really think Milo is a serious person, or as I am
36920	37920	very serious.
37920	38920	I'm serious!
38920	40720	I'm serious!
40720	44480	The news calls Milo a provocateur, but I'm starting to think that provocateur is just
44480	45920	a pretentious word for asshole.
45920	50480	What Milo really is is a preening, narcissistic no-face whose main infatuation is with his
50480	51480	own minor celebrity.
51480	56040	He's an opportunist who gained fame by championing gamergate, though he clearly has nothing but
56040	60400	disdain for gamers who he consistently characterizes as beta male manbabies.
60400	64120	He's now taking after his friend Dan Coulter and making a career out of saying false and
64120	68120	immoral things to get negative attention from easily offended liberals, something that any
68120	70400	12-year-old with a Twitter account could do.
70400	75200	His articles and speeches blend generic right-wing babble with exaggerated attacks on feminists,
75200	78160	Black Lives Matter, and transgender and fat people.
78160	82640	All this is plastered over with a thin layer of homosexual glamour, which in this case
82640	87880	means calling feminists darling and dressing like he made his first thousand dollars 12
87880	88880	minutes ago.
88880	93560	When he was banned last week on Twitter for his borderline racist participation in an
93560	100600	extremely racist mob attack on Leslie Jones, his poor duped fans tweeted "#FreeMilo," and
100600	105400	complained about Orwellian censorship, while Milo himself bragged about the long-anticipated
105400	110000	ban which he celebrated as the latest victory in his war against people not paying attention
110000	111000	to him.
111040	113840	I just got banned from Twitter!
115840	120720	All of this is pretty typical of the tedious reality TV type circus that American politics
120720	121720	has become.
121720	125520	But what I find interesting is that a lot of people seem to be really attracted to Milo,
125520	129080	even people who are somewhat sympathetic to social justice, and I'd like to talk about
129080	130080	why that is.
130080	134000	I've spoken to some Milo fans, and they all tell me they like him because he's funny and
134000	136000	fabulous and contrarian.
136000	137360	But is he?
137440	141920	His humor mostly seems to consist in the most primitive sort of insults and put-downs.
141920	143200	This is what men drink!
143200	144200	I do man stuff!
144200	147640	Now there is a venerable tradition of bitchy gay humor.
147640	152360	It was cruel, capricious, dark.
152360	154880	But Milo really doesn't belong to that tradition.
154880	159640	Great gay humorists like Crisp or David Sedaris use self-deprecation to balance out the bitchiness,
159640	161840	and they have a sense of the tragic.
161840	166160	It's the human condition, or the homosexual condition, that's often the butt of the jokes.
166160	167960	It's a little like Jewish humor that way.
167960	169600	And you know, Milo is also Jewish.
169600	171640	I mean, what the hell is going on here?
171640	172640	A gay Jew!
172640	174280	You'd think he'd be guaranteed to be funny.
174280	179600	But Milo has been seduced by the brutal, Hitlerian charm of Donald Trump, and in consequence
179600	183560	his humor is essentially self-aggrandizement at other people's expense.
183560	187360	I am perfectly happy to be your martyr in this.
187360	194040	But despite all that, there is one talking point Milo has that is very interesting to
194040	197720	me, and I think it might help explain why people are attracted to him.
197720	201280	Again and again, Milo suggests that what's great about him, and about the Republican
201280	205520	Party that he delusionally imagines could be crafted in his image, is that he's fun
205520	208040	and fabulous and glamorous.
208040	212320	His one criticism of the left that I think is genuine is his complaint that they're
212320	216000	joyless and humorless, and that they resent glamour and excess.
216000	219920	And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, he actually has a bit of a point.
220440	224720	Now I say this on the basis of my own experience with academic feminism, which in general does
224720	226920	tend to be a little dour and joyless.
226920	231160	It sounds like a frivolous objection, but I want to argue that it actually matters.
231160	235240	For instance, I sometimes try to put myself in the headspace of the people who just despise
235240	236400	Anita Sarkeesian.
236400	239400	Honestly, I have no serious beef with Anita.
239400	243800	I have some quibbles about some of the games that she chooses as examples, but I don't
243800	246760	really disagree with the substance of what she says.
246760	249760	But some people fucking hate Anita.
249760	250760	Why is that?
250760	255360	Well, apart from the obvious misogynist contingent, I guess it's that life is shit, and work
255360	259560	is hard, and gamers don't want to come home at the end of the day and have this brow-furrowing
259560	263520	moralist tell them that their one little solace is problematic.
263520	265360	And you know, I kind of get that.
265360	268440	Now to be fair to Anita, she does occasionally say,
268440	273760	But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media
273760	277840	while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.
277840	282240	But if you interpret feminism badly, you could get the impression that what feminists want
282240	287360	is this bleak world where everyone goes around critiquing things, and there's no room left
287360	291680	for spontaneity or irony or joy or sex or art.
291680	296560	And although I think this is of course a terrible misunderstanding, I also think that sometimes
296560	299760	academic feminists are not the best at discouraging it.
299760	304240	My main issue with Anita, for example, isn't about what she says, but about her style.
304240	306200	And I don't mean the way she dresses.
306200	307600	I actually think she looks cute.
307600	308600	CONFESS!
308600	309600	I CONFESS!
309600	311600	I mean the way she presents her ideas.
311600	314760	You've got no style, Anita, no style!
314760	317640	Your videos are whiny, and academic, and boring.
317640	322880	You bypass valuable opportunities to make furry jokes, you mispronounce and then translate
322880	323880	French clichés.
323880	327200	C'est raison d'être, or reason for existence.
327200	328200	See?
328200	329200	I can be a bitch.
329200	330600	You people think being a bitch is funny?
330600	333200	I'll bitch all over your goddamn nips!
334200	339200	What I'm suggesting is being on the right side of politics and morality isn't the only
339200	340200	thing that matters in life.
340200	345200	Now I'm about to get very philosophical about this, so you might want to grab your fedora.
345200	350480	I want to propose that there are two principles that contribute to the good life, which I'll
350480	353200	call the moral and the aesthetic.
353200	358520	This is similar to a distinction made by another philosopher, but I'm not going to use his
358520	362440	terms because they're too pretentious to say in a YouTube video, and because I am a much
362440	365560	better philosopher than him.
365560	370320	The moral principle includes things like reason, logic, and judgments about right and wrong.
370320	374800	The aesthetic principle includes things like style, humor, irony, and creativity.
374800	378840	Without a balance between the two principles, you can't really live a full human life.
378840	383480	If you're too dominated by the moral principle, you become dry, lifeless, and negative, at
383480	385760	worst a kind of puritan or fanatic.
385760	390240	If you're too dominated by the aesthetic principle, you become shallow, self-centered, hedonistic,
390240	391240	and empty.
391240	394320	Anita's public persona has too much of the moralist.
394320	398400	Milo has too much of the esthi- Well, Milo has too much of the esthi.
398400	402240	But note that an esthi without morality is actually bad esthi.
402240	404640	Milo thinks he's Oscar Wilde, but he's not.
404640	408040	He's fucking Dorian Gray.
408040	411240	He's a vain shell of a man, because he has no real moral sense.
411240	414680	You know, you can do something because it's interesting, but that doesn't make it a good
414680	418160	thing to do, like taking psychedelic drugs at Dave and Buster's.
418160	421440	Is this what eternity feels like?
421440	423080	Because I want out, God.
423080	424080	I want out.
424080	428680	Also, there's something missing in a moralist with no style, or something almost inhumane
428680	429680	about it.
429680	435080	What YouTube needs, what humanity needs, is someone who can balance the two principles.
435080	444080	Moral and aesthetic, light and dark, male and female, drunkenness and robo-tripping,
444080	448640	ready and baw-me.
448640	450240	Oh my God.
450240	452080	I am the chosen one.
452080	455960	It is I who must bring balance to the force.
455960	460800	I am God.

463600	466880	Patron J. Michael Comfort wants to know, if Anita Sarkeesian was a Pokemon, which would
466880	467880	she be?
467880	470920	Well, at first I was thinking she was Meowth, because she's good at generating coins.
470920	474320	Or Pikachu, because she won't be contained by Pokeballs or patriarchy.
474320	477440	But to me, she'll always be Marowak, because she's my perfect dark mother, and someday
477440	478480	I will avenge her.
