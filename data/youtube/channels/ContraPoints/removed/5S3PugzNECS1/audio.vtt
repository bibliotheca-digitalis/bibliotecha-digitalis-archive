00:00.000 --> 00:27.680
So in a way I regard it as beneath my dignity to make a video about Milo Yiannopoulos, but

00:27.680 --> 00:31.440
some things being beneath my dignity has never been enough to stop me before, and it certainly

00:31.440 --> 00:32.840
isn't going to stop me now.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.920
I say beneath my dignity because I don't really think Milo is a serious person, or as I am

00:36.920 --> 00:37.920
very serious.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.920
I'm serious!

00:38.920 --> 00:40.720
I'm serious!

00:40.720 --> 00:44.480
The news calls Milo a provocateur, but I'm starting to think that provocateur is just

00:44.480 --> 00:45.920
a pretentious word for asshole.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.480
What Milo really is is a preening, narcissistic no-face whose main infatuation is with his

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
own minor celebrity.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.040
He's an opportunist who gained fame by championing gamergate, though he clearly has nothing but

00:56.040 --> 01:00.400
disdain for gamers who he consistently characterizes as beta male manbabies.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.120
He's now taking after his friend Dan Coulter and making a career out of saying false and

01:04.120 --> 01:08.120
immoral things to get negative attention from easily offended liberals, something that any

01:08.120 --> 01:10.400
12-year-old with a Twitter account could do.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.200
His articles and speeches blend generic right-wing babble with exaggerated attacks on feminists,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.160
Black Lives Matter, and transgender and fat people.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.640
All this is plastered over with a thin layer of homosexual glamour, which in this case

01:22.640 --> 01:27.880
means calling feminists darling and dressing like he made his first thousand dollars 12

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
minutes ago.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.560
When he was banned last week on Twitter for his borderline racist participation in an

01:33.560 --> 01:40.600
extremely racist mob attack on Leslie Jones, his poor duped fans tweeted "#FreeMilo," and

01:40.600 --> 01:45.400
complained about Orwellian censorship, while Milo himself bragged about the long-anticipated

01:45.400 --> 01:50.000
ban which he celebrated as the latest victory in his war against people not paying attention

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
to him.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.840
I just got banned from Twitter!

01:55.840 --> 02:00.720
All of this is pretty typical of the tedious reality TV type circus that American politics

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
has become.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.520
But what I find interesting is that a lot of people seem to be really attracted to Milo,

02:05.520 --> 02:09.080
even people who are somewhat sympathetic to social justice, and I'd like to talk about

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
why that is.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.000
I've spoken to some Milo fans, and they all tell me they like him because he's funny and

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
fabulous and contrarian.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.360
But is he?

02:17.440 --> 02:21.920
His humor mostly seems to consist in the most primitive sort of insults and put-downs.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.200
This is what men drink!

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
I do man stuff!

02:24.200 --> 02:27.640
Now there is a venerable tradition of bitchy gay humor.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.360
It was cruel, capricious, dark.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.880
But Milo really doesn't belong to that tradition.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.640
Great gay humorists like Crisp or David Sedaris use self-deprecation to balance out the bitchiness,

02:39.640 --> 02:41.840
and they have a sense of the tragic.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.160
It's the human condition, or the homosexual condition, that's often the butt of the jokes.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.960
It's a little like Jewish humor that way.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.600
And you know, Milo is also Jewish.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.640
I mean, what the hell is going on here?

02:51.640 --> 02:52.640
A gay Jew!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.280
You'd think he'd be guaranteed to be funny.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.600
But Milo has been seduced by the brutal, Hitlerian charm of Donald Trump, and in consequence

02:59.600 --> 03:03.560
his humor is essentially self-aggrandizement at other people's expense.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.360
I am perfectly happy to be your martyr in this.

03:07.360 --> 03:14.040
But despite all that, there is one talking point Milo has that is very interesting to

03:14.040 --> 03:17.720
me, and I think it might help explain why people are attracted to him.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.280
Again and again, Milo suggests that what's great about him, and about the Republican

03:21.280 --> 03:25.520
Party that he delusionally imagines could be crafted in his image, is that he's fun

03:25.520 --> 03:28.040
and fabulous and glamorous.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.320
His one criticism of the left that I think is genuine is his complaint that they're

03:32.320 --> 03:36.000
joyless and humorless, and that they resent glamour and excess.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.920
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, he actually has a bit of a point.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.720
Now I say this on the basis of my own experience with academic feminism, which in general does

03:44.720 --> 03:46.920
tend to be a little dour and joyless.

03:46.920 --> 03:51.160
It sounds like a frivolous objection, but I want to argue that it actually matters.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.240
For instance, I sometimes try to put myself in the headspace of the people who just despise

03:55.240 --> 03:56.400
Anita Sarkeesian.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.400
Honestly, I have no serious beef with Anita.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.800
I have some quibbles about some of the games that she chooses as examples, but I don't

04:03.800 --> 04:06.760
really disagree with the substance of what she says.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.760
But some people fucking hate Anita.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
Why is that?

04:10.760 --> 04:15.360
Well, apart from the obvious misogynist contingent, I guess it's that life is shit, and work

04:15.360 --> 04:19.560
is hard, and gamers don't want to come home at the end of the day and have this brow-furrowing

04:19.560 --> 04:23.520
moralist tell them that their one little solace is problematic.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.360
And you know, I kind of get that.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.440
Now to be fair to Anita, she does occasionally say,

04:28.440 --> 04:33.760
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media

04:33.760 --> 04:37.840
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.240
But if you interpret feminism badly, you could get the impression that what feminists want

04:42.240 --> 04:47.360
is this bleak world where everyone goes around critiquing things, and there's no room left

04:47.360 --> 04:51.680
for spontaneity or irony or joy or sex or art.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.560
And although I think this is of course a terrible misunderstanding, I also think that sometimes

04:56.560 --> 04:59.760
academic feminists are not the best at discouraging it.

04:59.760 --> 05:04.240
My main issue with Anita, for example, isn't about what she says, but about her style.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.200
And I don't mean the way she dresses.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.600
I actually think she looks cute.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
CONFESS!

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
I CONFESS!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.600
I mean the way she presents her ideas.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.760
You've got no style, Anita, no style!

05:14.760 --> 05:17.640
Your videos are whiny, and academic, and boring.

05:17.640 --> 05:22.880
You bypass valuable opportunities to make furry jokes, you mispronounce and then translate

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
French clichés.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.200
C'est raison d'être, or reason for existence.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
See?

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
I can be a bitch.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.600
You people think being a bitch is funny?

05:30.600 --> 05:33.200
I'll bitch all over your goddamn nips!

05:34.200 --> 05:39.200
What I'm suggesting is being on the right side of politics and morality isn't the only

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
thing that matters in life.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.200
Now I'm about to get very philosophical about this, so you might want to grab your fedora.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.480
I want to propose that there are two principles that contribute to the good life, which I'll

05:50.480 --> 05:53.200
call the moral and the aesthetic.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.520
This is similar to a distinction made by another philosopher, but I'm not going to use his

05:58.520 --> 06:02.440
terms because they're too pretentious to say in a YouTube video, and because I am a much

06:02.440 --> 06:05.560
better philosopher than him.

06:05.560 --> 06:10.320
The moral principle includes things like reason, logic, and judgments about right and wrong.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.800
The aesthetic principle includes things like style, humor, irony, and creativity.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.840
Without a balance between the two principles, you can't really live a full human life.

06:18.840 --> 06:23.480
If you're too dominated by the moral principle, you become dry, lifeless, and negative, at

06:23.480 --> 06:25.760
worst a kind of puritan or fanatic.

06:25.760 --> 06:30.240
If you're too dominated by the aesthetic principle, you become shallow, self-centered, hedonistic,

06:30.240 --> 06:31.240
and empty.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.320
Anita's public persona has too much of the moralist.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.400
Milo has too much of the esthi- Well, Milo has too much of the esthi.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.240
But note that an esthi without morality is actually bad esthi.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.640
Milo thinks he's Oscar Wilde, but he's not.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.040
He's fucking Dorian Gray.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.240
He's a vain shell of a man, because he has no real moral sense.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.680
You know, you can do something because it's interesting, but that doesn't make it a good

06:54.680 --> 06:58.160
thing to do, like taking psychedelic drugs at Dave and Buster's.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.440
Is this what eternity feels like?

07:01.440 --> 07:03.080
Because I want out, God.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.080
I want out.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.680
Also, there's something missing in a moralist with no style, or something almost inhumane

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
about it.

07:09.680 --> 07:15.080
What YouTube needs, what humanity needs, is someone who can balance the two principles.

07:15.080 --> 07:24.080
Moral and aesthetic, light and dark, male and female, drunkenness and robo-tripping,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.640
ready and baw-me.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.240
Oh my God.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.080
I am the chosen one.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.960
It is I who must bring balance to the force.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.800
I am God.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.600

07:43.600 --> 07:46.880
Patron J. Michael Comfort wants to know, if Anita Sarkeesian was a Pokemon, which would

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
she be?

07:47.880 --> 07:50.920
Well, at first I was thinking she was Meowth, because she's good at generating coins.

07:50.920 --> 07:54.320
Or Pikachu, because she won't be contained by Pokeballs or patriarchy.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.440
But to me, she'll always be Marowak, because she's my perfect dark mother, and someday

07:57.440 --> 07:58.480
I will avenge her.
