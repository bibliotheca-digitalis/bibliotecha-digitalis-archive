1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,680
So in a way I regard it as beneath my dignity to make a video about Milo Yiannopoulos, but

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,440
some things being beneath my dignity has never been enough to stop me before, and it certainly

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,840
isn't going to stop me now.

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,920
I say beneath my dignity because I don't really think Milo is a serious person, or as I am

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
very serious.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm serious!

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm serious!

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,480
The news calls Milo a provocateur, but I'm starting to think that provocateur is just

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
a pretentious word for asshole.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
What Milo really is is a preening, narcissistic no-face whose main infatuation is with his

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
own minor celebrity.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,040
He's an opportunist who gained fame by championing gamergate, though he clearly has nothing but

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,400
disdain for gamers who he consistently characterizes as beta male manbabies.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,120
He's now taking after his friend Dan Coulter and making a career out of saying false and

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,120
immoral things to get negative attention from easily offended liberals, something that any

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,400
12-year-old with a Twitter account could do.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,200
His articles and speeches blend generic right-wing babble with exaggerated attacks on feminists,

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,160
Black Lives Matter, and transgender and fat people.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,640
All this is plastered over with a thin layer of homosexual glamour, which in this case

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,880
means calling feminists darling and dressing like he made his first thousand dollars 12

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
minutes ago.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,560
When he was banned last week on Twitter for his borderline racist participation in an

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,600
extremely racist mob attack on Leslie Jones, his poor duped fans tweeted "#FreeMilo," and

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,400
complained about Orwellian censorship, while Milo himself bragged about the long-anticipated

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,000
ban which he celebrated as the latest victory in his war against people not paying attention

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to him.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,840
I just got banned from Twitter!

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,720
All of this is pretty typical of the tedious reality TV type circus that American politics

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
has become.

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,520
But what I find interesting is that a lot of people seem to be really attracted to Milo,

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,080
even people who are somewhat sympathetic to social justice, and I'd like to talk about

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
why that is.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
I've spoken to some Milo fans, and they all tell me they like him because he's funny and

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
fabulous and contrarian.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
But is he?

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,920
His humor mostly seems to consist in the most primitive sort of insults and put-downs.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
This is what men drink!

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I do man stuff!

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,640
Now there is a venerable tradition of bitchy gay humor.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,360
It was cruel, capricious, dark.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,880
But Milo really doesn't belong to that tradition.

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,640
Great gay humorists like Crisp or David Sedaris use self-deprecation to balance out the bitchiness,

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,840
and they have a sense of the tragic.

44
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
It's the human condition, or the homosexual condition, that's often the butt of the jokes.

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
It's a little like Jewish humor that way.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,600
And you know, Milo is also Jewish.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,640
I mean, what the hell is going on here?

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
A gay Jew!

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,280
You'd think he'd be guaranteed to be funny.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,600
But Milo has been seduced by the brutal, Hitlerian charm of Donald Trump, and in consequence

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,560
his humor is essentially self-aggrandizement at other people's expense.

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,360
I am perfectly happy to be your martyr in this.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,040
But despite all that, there is one talking point Milo has that is very interesting to

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,720
me, and I think it might help explain why people are attracted to him.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,280
Again and again, Milo suggests that what's great about him, and about the Republican

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,520
Party that he delusionally imagines could be crafted in his image, is that he's fun

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,040
and fabulous and glamorous.

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,320
His one criticism of the left that I think is genuine is his complaint that they're

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,000
joyless and humorless, and that they resent glamour and excess.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,920
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, he actually has a bit of a point.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,720
Now I say this on the basis of my own experience with academic feminism, which in general does

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,920
tend to be a little dour and joyless.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,160
It sounds like a frivolous objection, but I want to argue that it actually matters.

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,240
For instance, I sometimes try to put myself in the headspace of the people who just despise

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
Anita Sarkeesian.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Honestly, I have no serious beef with Anita.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,800
I have some quibbles about some of the games that she chooses as examples, but I don't

68
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,760
really disagree with the substance of what she says.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,760
But some people fucking hate Anita.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Why is that?

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,360
Well, apart from the obvious misogynist contingent, I guess it's that life is shit, and work

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,560
is hard, and gamers don't want to come home at the end of the day and have this brow-furrowing

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,520
moralist tell them that their one little solace is problematic.

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
And you know, I kind of get that.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,440
Now to be fair to Anita, she does occasionally say,

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,760
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary, to simultaneously enjoy media

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,840
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240
But if you interpret feminism badly, you could get the impression that what feminists want

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,360
is this bleak world where everyone goes around critiquing things, and there's no room left

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
for spontaneity or irony or joy or sex or art.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
And although I think this is of course a terrible misunderstanding, I also think that sometimes

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,760
academic feminists are not the best at discouraging it.

83
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,240
My main issue with Anita, for example, isn't about what she says, but about her style.

84
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,200
And I don't mean the way she dresses.

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
I actually think she looks cute.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
CONFESS!

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I CONFESS!

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I mean the way she presents her ideas.

89
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,760
You've got no style, Anita, no style!

90
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,640
Your videos are whiny, and academic, and boring.

91
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,880
You bypass valuable opportunities to make furry jokes, you mispronounce and then translate

92
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
French clichés.

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,200
C'est raison d'être, or reason for existence.

94
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
See?

95
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I can be a bitch.

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
You people think being a bitch is funny?

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll bitch all over your goddamn nips!

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,200
What I'm suggesting is being on the right side of politics and morality isn't the only

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
thing that matters in life.

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Now I'm about to get very philosophical about this, so you might want to grab your fedora.

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,480
I want to propose that there are two principles that contribute to the good life, which I'll

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,200
call the moral and the aesthetic.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,520
This is similar to a distinction made by another philosopher, but I'm not going to use his

104
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,440
terms because they're too pretentious to say in a YouTube video, and because I am a much

105
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,560
better philosopher than him.

106
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,320
The moral principle includes things like reason, logic, and judgments about right and wrong.

107
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,800
The aesthetic principle includes things like style, humor, irony, and creativity.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Without a balance between the two principles, you can't really live a full human life.

109
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,480
If you're too dominated by the moral principle, you become dry, lifeless, and negative, at

110
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,760
worst a kind of puritan or fanatic.

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,240
If you're too dominated by the aesthetic principle, you become shallow, self-centered, hedonistic,

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
and empty.

113
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,320
Anita's public persona has too much of the moralist.

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Milo has too much of the esthi- Well, Milo has too much of the esthi.

115
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,240
But note that an esthi without morality is actually bad esthi.

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,640
Milo thinks he's Oscar Wilde, but he's not.

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,040
He's fucking Dorian Gray.

118
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,240
He's a vain shell of a man, because he has no real moral sense.

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,680
You know, you can do something because it's interesting, but that doesn't make it a good

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,160
thing to do, like taking psychedelic drugs at Dave and Buster's.

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
Is this what eternity feels like?

122
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,080
Because I want out, God.

123
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I want out.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,680
Also, there's something missing in a moralist with no style, or something almost inhumane

125
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
about it.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,080
What YouTube needs, what humanity needs, is someone who can balance the two principles.

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Moral and aesthetic, light and dark, male and female, drunkenness and robo-tripping,

128
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,640
ready and baw-me.

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
Oh my God.

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
I am the chosen one.

131
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,960
It is I who must bring balance to the force.

132
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,800
I am God.

Patron J. Michael Comfort wants to know, if Anita Sarkeesian was a Pokemon, which would

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
she be?

136
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,920
Well, at first I was thinking she was Meowth, because she's good at generating coins.

137
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,320
Or Pikachu, because she won't be contained by Pokeballs or patriarchy.

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,440
But to me, she'll always be Marowak, because she's my perfect dark mother, and someday

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
I will avenge her.
