WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.960
Yeah, I know Jon and I have, have you watched Nickatine2's recent videos on ethics where

00:20.960 --> 00:22.560
he's sort of battling himself?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.120
Yeah, I like that.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.680
I mean that's, that's brilliant, the almost schizophrenic multi-personality I think is

00:28.680 --> 00:35.560
a good, just underlying kind of way to look at things, it's more complexity than initially

00:35.560 --> 00:38.200
things seem to be, even in ourselves, so.

00:38.200 --> 00:45.200
So yeah, I guess we could start with, with ethics, I mean I know you, you're an atheist

00:45.200 --> 00:51.240
and you obviously think that there's a way to preserve morality and ethics independent

00:51.240 --> 00:53.440
of any theological worldview, right?

00:53.440 --> 00:56.080
Yeah, I think so.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.920
So how do you, how do you ground your ethical system, granted that there's some ambiguity

01:00.920 --> 01:05.520
there for you in light of these last two videos, but, you know, how do you approach the thing?

01:05.520 --> 01:09.440
Well, I mean I know you hate doing this, but suppose we were to start in sort of a place

01:09.440 --> 01:17.480
of Cartesian skepticism, where we, where we know what it feels like to have desires, to

01:17.480 --> 01:26.480
feel pleasure, to feel pain, and we can infer that other people have similar sensations,

01:26.480 --> 01:31.520
that other people have desires and wishes and can feel pain and suffering just as we

01:31.520 --> 01:37.800
can, and we can empathize with them, we can, we have the imaginative power to put ourselves

01:37.800 --> 01:42.960
in their place and act in a way that benefits not only our own selves, our own interests,

01:42.960 --> 01:45.120
but also the interests of other minds.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.980
Right, yeah.

01:46.980 --> 01:50.580
So empathy then would be the basis of, of morality?

01:50.580 --> 01:52.380
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.380
Okay.

01:53.380 --> 01:57.220
And you know, you said we have to begin with a sort of Cartesian skepticism to write.

01:57.220 --> 01:58.980
We don't have to, but we could.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
Right.

01:59.980 --> 02:05.220
Well, I mean, it almost seemed to me though that it's sort of, while Descartes sort of

02:05.220 --> 02:11.060
skepticism involves reflection, I think empathy with others is sort of immediate, you know,

02:11.060 --> 02:14.940
when you see someone who's in pain, you just feel their pain, you know, not literally.

02:14.940 --> 02:15.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15.940 --> 02:16.940
I mean, it's much more immediate than that.

02:16.940 --> 02:17.940
You're right.

02:17.940 --> 02:21.300
I mean, Descartes' skepticism is, I mean, I don't, he didn't even believe that for a

02:21.300 --> 02:22.300
second.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.300
That was just his method.

02:23.300 --> 02:29.100
You know, that's something you only come to through thinking about it a lot.

02:29.100 --> 02:34.140
Immediately, there's no question that other people have experiences like your own.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.140
Right.

02:35.140 --> 02:36.140
Yeah.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.140
I would hope not.

02:37.140 --> 02:38.140
But, you know.

02:38.140 --> 02:39.140
Yeah, I would hope not.

02:39.140 --> 02:44.260
But there's something to reflecting on it, you know, after all said and done, after the

02:44.260 --> 02:48.380
immediate event is done, you have time to go back and sip a little wine and reflect

02:48.380 --> 02:49.380
on it.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.700
Is there something to that dimension that complexifies and matures your empathy?

02:53.700 --> 02:56.140
Is it, would you say that's accurate, Nick?

02:56.140 --> 02:57.140
Yeah.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.140
Yeah.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.140
Yeah.

02:59.140 --> 03:03.980
Well, I mean, maybe we could just make a distinction between ethics and morality where ethics is

03:03.980 --> 03:08.300
sort of the practical action in the day-to-day world and then when you come up with a moral

03:08.300 --> 03:12.360
philosophy, that's when you start reflecting on, wait a minute, maybe that ethical decision

03:12.360 --> 03:18.320
I made in the heat of battle wasn't exactly as moral as it could have been.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
That's right.

03:19.320 --> 03:24.800
Well, you know, when you're in day-to-day life, you don't always have a chance to like

03:24.800 --> 03:29.120
reflect on what the most moral action might be in that situation.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.120
Well, yeah.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.880
To sit there for now, we're thinking about whether you're going to give someone a transplant

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
or so.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.880
Yeah.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
Right.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.880
You don't have time to think about these things.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.880
And I like, we're talking about ethics.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.280
I like how movies, especially a movie we just saw District 9 on, I don't know if you've

03:42.280 --> 03:43.280
seen that Nick yet.

03:43.280 --> 03:48.720
It ultimately comes out to be a very strong ethical movie.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.120
There's lots of questions amongst all this action and some comical scenes, there are

03:53.120 --> 03:58.560
some really ethical dilemmas in the movie, which I think is good that's promoted in a,

03:58.560 --> 04:00.360
it's a popular kind of meme.

04:00.360 --> 04:05.800
So is it infiltrating pop culture these days, ethics, like through movies like The Matrix,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.440
movies like District 9, is that the way to do it?

04:08.440 --> 04:10.440
Is our sound okay?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.440
Yeah.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.120
I think there's usually, yeah, a lot of movies have some kind of ethical message in them.

04:15.120 --> 04:20.240
I mean, even like the most named superhero movie usually makes some attempt at some kind

04:20.240 --> 04:21.880
of ethical situation.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.720
Well, I remember the most recent, The Dark Knight, the Batman movie, had a bunch of stuff

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
in that.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.880
Like there was one scene I remember where the Joker has these two boats full of people,

04:30.880 --> 04:35.800
one's all prisoners and one's all just regular people and he's trying to get them to blow

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
each other up or something.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
Right.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Yeah.

04:38.840 --> 04:43.560
And then you see people getting ready to, getting a trigger, and then you actually see

04:43.560 --> 04:47.880
the criminal do one of the most ethical things and he throws it out, you know, we're the

04:47.880 --> 04:48.880
bad guys.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.880
Right.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.720
Yeah, so they're trying to, I mean, I guess it's the skillful means, is that right?

04:53.720 --> 04:56.800
The right director knows how to do it the right way, I suppose?

04:56.800 --> 04:57.800
Yeah.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
Right.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
Yeah.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
Okay.

05:00.800 --> 05:06.960
Well, so I guess, where else can we go with ethics?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.360
Ethics is a big thing.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.000
We don't have to abandon it so far, I mean, a lot of people get into serious arguments

05:13.000 --> 05:16.080
about ethics and when do we put in relativism?

05:16.080 --> 05:21.160
How big of a postmodern kind of world view do you adapt?

05:21.160 --> 05:24.800
What's healthy in your view before it goes to mushy, mushy, gushy, gushy?

05:24.800 --> 05:30.480
Well, I mean, that's a difficult question because you do have these striking examples

05:30.480 --> 05:34.440
of other cultures where things are completely different, like am I allowed, for example,

05:34.440 --> 05:41.720
to condemn someone, an Islamic extremist who kills their own daughter because she left

05:41.720 --> 05:45.920
the religion or something and I almost can't help condemning them, but on the other hand...

05:45.920 --> 05:50.280
That seems like an easier question to answer, I mean, when it's taking someone's life, but

05:50.280 --> 05:52.920
what about like, you know, the headscarves and whatnot?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.360
Do you think women should be explored dressed like women?

05:55.360 --> 06:02.360
Oh, yeah, well, that stuff, I mean, that's relatively minor, I mean, I don't have any

06:02.360 --> 06:04.760
huge objection to women wearing headscarves.

06:04.760 --> 06:11.120
The burqa is a little more up in the air because a lot of times the women wearing those things

06:11.120 --> 06:15.560
are not doing so their own, you know, they're not making a fashion statement, they have

06:15.560 --> 06:18.720
a man and a life enforcing this.

06:18.720 --> 06:23.800
Where was it in, was it Lebanon recently that a woman was wearing pants in public and she...

06:23.800 --> 06:26.360
Yeah, was sentenced to death wearing pants, right.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.360
Was it death or just lashings or something?

06:28.360 --> 06:33.840
No, it was like the lashing equivalent of a death sentence, like 40 lashings or something.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Oh, yeah.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.640
There's a part of you that just says, what the fuck is going on?

06:37.640 --> 06:38.640
That's ridiculous.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.640
I think that's, I mean, but see, just if we can all agree that that's ridiculous, another

06:43.640 --> 06:48.600
moral question is, should we actually go to Lebanon invading it and actually try to change

06:48.600 --> 06:49.600
it?

06:49.600 --> 06:54.000
That's, I'll cover up with Professor Anton actually is the concept of, and you're going

06:54.000 --> 06:59.880
to get a lot of people hissing and moaning at this, a one-world type of governing system

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
body.

07:00.880 --> 07:06.160
But it's also, to try to fix the problem would cause, at least initially, more violence and

07:06.160 --> 07:09.480
death than the problem itself.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
This is also seen in movies.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.360
I mean, more absolute power, would that corrupt?

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
Absolutely.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.160
I mean, I think, I've seen a video where you've actually quoted that and tried to explain

07:16.160 --> 07:18.600
about that, but it just seems like, what do you do?

07:18.600 --> 07:23.480
This is just this dilemma, do we just let them be or do we go absolute, Ron Paul, libertarian,

07:23.960 --> 07:28.600
you know, you guys go for it, how about it, you know?

07:28.600 --> 07:33.480
So what, I mean, how do you deal with some of these questions where you see the truth,

07:33.480 --> 07:37.160
the grain of truth that they bring to the perspective?

07:37.160 --> 07:41.080
Like there's a party that nods, like, yeah, it makes sense, but at the same time, it conflicts.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
This is strange.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
Yeah.

07:43.080 --> 07:49.000
Well, let me ask you, Nikitin, do you think that there is in any way a good, a capital

07:49.000 --> 07:54.280
G good that's greater than any particular cultural good that sort of has authority over

07:54.280 --> 07:57.720
what any particular world you may think is good?

07:57.720 --> 08:00.480
Or do you think that that's just an illusion?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.640
I don't think so.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.200
I don't think that exists.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.240
I think good is a creation of our own minds and our own minds are, of course, running

08:08.240 --> 08:11.080
a lot of cultural software that are influencing it.

08:11.080 --> 08:17.760
I mean, I think there are some basic ideas that are so a part of who we are, biologically

08:17.760 --> 08:24.160
speaking, that pretty much all of us, with the exception of, say, sociopaths, have these

08:24.160 --> 08:31.880
intuitions and feelings, but I don't think there's like a good floating out in the way.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
Right.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
Right.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.400
Well, I think someone else watching this might interpret that, like, you take the stance

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
of amendum.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.680
He thinks there's an objective, you know, it's a fact of suffering, so not suffering

08:42.680 --> 08:44.600
would be objectively good for him.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.600
Right.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.000
And you try to say, well, that does a subjective spin, not that it's wrong, or an intersubjective

08:50.000 --> 08:55.320
spin, but he says, no, you're fucked-hearted, it has to be, it is an objective kind of thing.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
Yeah, you're right.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
Yeah.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
Amendum, he said suffering is fucking objective.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.320
You know, I've never been able to figure out what he means by that, because to me, it seems

09:03.320 --> 09:08.840
like suffering, pleasure, color, all of that is fairly subjective.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.640
So I can't even figure out what he's trying to say.

09:11.680 --> 09:17.840
I agree with the underlying message that he's trying to convey, just not the way he tries

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
to convey it.

09:18.840 --> 09:24.880
I usually agree with the inclusions he draws, but the way he comes to conclusions is weird.
