00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
On the morning of April 12, 2015, three police officers on bike patrol near a housing project

00:09.400 --> 00:14.000
in West Baltimore made eye contact with a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.960
When Freddie fled the police on sight, he was chased down, arrested for carrying a spring-assisted

00:18.960 --> 00:21.540
knife and dragged into a police van.

00:21.540 --> 00:24.580
The van made four stops before returning to the police station.

00:24.580 --> 00:28.080
At the first stop, Freddie was unloaded and shackled in leg irons and returned to the

00:28.080 --> 00:29.420
van without a seatbelt.

00:29.420 --> 00:33.100
He requested medical assistance, a request that the police ignored.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.700
When the van arrived at the police station, Freddie had lapsed into a coma, with three

00:36.700 --> 00:40.340
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.

00:40.340 --> 00:45.220
In the following days, the BPD released contradictory and inadequate accounts of Freddie's arrest.

00:45.220 --> 00:49.500
On April 18, hundreds of Baltimore citizens protested outside the Western District police

00:49.500 --> 00:50.680
station.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.460
The next day, Freddie died of his spinal injury, exactly one week after his arrest.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.960
Protests continued and escalated.

00:56.960 --> 01:07.320
Police began wearing riot gear, but the first week of protests was almost entirely peaceful.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.800
On April 25, thousands of protesters marched from the Western District to City Hall, demanding

01:11.800 --> 01:14.840
prosecution of the officers involved in Freddie's death.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.640
When crowds dispersed after protest leaders finished speaking, a large group marched to

01:18.640 --> 01:24.840
Camden Yards, where a kind of trash battle broke out at Pickles Pub.

01:24.840 --> 01:32.280
Some storefronts and car windows were smashed, and hundreds of riot police arrived to disperse

01:32.280 --> 01:34.280
the protesters.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.840
Two days later, on April 27, Freddie Gray's funeral was attended by hundreds of people,

01:38.840 --> 01:41.640
including several politicians and civil rights leaders.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.020
Meanwhile, police took preemptive action in response to plans spread by black high school

01:46.020 --> 01:50.920
students on social media to enact a purge situation beginning at Mondawmin Mall.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.000
Police shut down the Mondawmin metro station and cordoned off the area, debussing all students

01:55.000 --> 01:57.600
from Frederick Douglass High School across the street.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.920
The students were essentially quarantined by the police, with no way to get home.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.360
When the teenagers became unruly, a phalanx of riot police closed in on the area, firing

02:05.360 --> 02:19.400
plastic bullets into the crowd.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.680
Police arrested hundreds of people, and constitutional rights were suspended as prisoners were detained

02:23.680 --> 02:26.040
for up to 50 hours without a charge.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.800
Confrontations between protesters and police turned violent as the conflict spread through

02:29.800 --> 02:33.280
West Baltimore, where rioters began throwing rocks at the police.

02:33.280 --> 02:38.000
Then some fucking idiot set fire to the Pennsylvania Avenue CVS, and an even bigger fucking idiot

02:38.000 --> 02:42.280
set fire to the construction site of a senior center on the other side of the city.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.040
The mayor and governor declared a state of emergency, and a city-wide curfew was ordered

02:46.040 --> 02:47.200
for the next four nights.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.800
Residents from all over the city assembled in the following days to assist with a cleanup effort.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.480
Sifting through the footage of the riots and their aftermath, you find images of political

02:58.480 --> 03:02.640
uprising and resilient humanity, as well as aimless looting and violence.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.040
Unfortunately, the impression given by the international media was essentially that the

03:06.040 --> 03:08.760
entire city went up in flames, which is simply not true.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.320
But to this day, when I tell people I live in Baltimore, they react like I said I'm from

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
South Sudan.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.140
At the time of the unrest, I still lived in Chicago, where I watched all this unfold online.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.700
One thing that made an impression on me was a certain tendency of online commenters responding

03:22.700 --> 03:24.460
to videos of the uprising.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.960
And seeing as we've just elected our first comments section president, I think it's worth

03:27.960 --> 03:32.020
taking a look at this, not just to gawk, but to face head-on the ugly fact that some of

03:32.020 --> 03:36.020
the worst damage done by ghetto riots is a terrible reaction they often provoke from

03:36.020 --> 03:37.940
white people with more opinions than thoughts.

03:37.940 --> 03:42.460
Now I'll warn you, this is about to get about as racist as words on the screen can be, so

03:42.460 --> 03:46.020
raise yourself captain, a raging storm of hate approaches.

03:46.020 --> 03:49.940
These people give others a reason to be racist when they act like complete hooligan APES

03:49.940 --> 03:52.500
running through towns and burning and looting stores.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.380
They are an embarrassment to the human race and are sub-humans, IMO.

03:55.380 --> 03:59.260
I don't want to be that guy, but we gotta do something about the blacks.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.660
Where is Hitler when we need him?

04:00.660 --> 04:01.660
Shit.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.740
What part of Africa is this?

04:02.740 --> 04:04.180
Baltimore, Africa.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.780
Bunch of starving monkey.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.280
Obama-esque America.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.980
Not even a deadly bacteria is worse than these mongrels.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.100
Another major chimp-out.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.340
This was to be expected.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.860
Break out the high pressure fire hoses and the vicious dogs.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.340
Let the peaceful protests begin.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.100
Jungle bunny Disneyland.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.020
And that's why they're called savages.

04:21.020 --> 04:23.940
This only confirms what most think of you already, animals.

04:23.940 --> 04:26.820
And black people still wonder why they can't be accepted in society.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.180
Without white people, the zoo animals will be running around naked, hunting each other

04:30.180 --> 04:31.180
for food.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.600
Diversity and action.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.860
They need to build more jails or zoos.

04:34.860 --> 04:35.860
Disgusting!

04:35.860 --> 04:37.180
Street trash, they've ruined our cities.

04:37.180 --> 04:39.500
This is the wildest chimp-out I've ever seen.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.340
Blacks really are sub-human for fuck's sake, animals.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.220
I would have loved to be there with my AR-15 and just unload into these monkeys.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.700
That would have been so fulfilling.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.340
This is why I hate shit.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.600
92 thumbs up.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.220
Our cities used to be safe, but now we have diversity.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.060
Bitch don't build.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.620
They destroy or complain about welfare.

04:57.620 --> 04:58.620
End welfare.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.300
Put the bitch to work.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.680
Let them starve!

05:01.680 --> 05:03.400
Make them starve to death.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.900
Maybe they'll stop breading targets.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.500
Black people are animals.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.940
Death to all bitches will always be violent like uncivilized people.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.180
Not gentle people.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.540
Cun nut AK.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.540
Africa.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.020
Blacks are most racist people.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.860
Time to put these animals in cages.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.180
Savage African half-apes.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.180
Stop!

05:21.180 --> 05:28.580
I am the social justice police, and you're under arrest for racism.

05:28.580 --> 05:38.140
Seriously though, anyone still want to argue that racism is over?

05:38.140 --> 05:41.380
Now would be the time to leave a comment arguing that there's no such thing as racism.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.980
Collarum, Johnson.

05:42.980 --> 05:43.980
Part...ugh.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.980
Why so racist?

05:45.980 --> 05:49.820
So how do we stop this?

05:49.820 --> 05:54.180
Well, one way might be to try to spread awareness of the circumstances that lead this to happen.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.460
And that's worth doing anyway, since if we know what leads to this, we can start thinking

05:57.460 --> 05:58.460
about how to prevent it.

05:58.460 --> 06:02.340
Overt racial hate was obviously a big part of white America's response to the Baltimore

06:02.340 --> 06:06.700
Riots, and to any number of other uprisings before and after, and it'll likely be no different

06:06.700 --> 06:08.260
with similar events in the future.

06:08.260 --> 06:11.940
But perhaps even more common and damaging is simple ignorance and misinformation about

06:11.940 --> 06:15.500
the causes of these things, and also therefore about the right ways to prevent them.

06:15.500 --> 06:20.300
The solution proposed by our dear god, president-elect, and also by racists, but I'm sure that's just

06:20.300 --> 06:26.980
a coincidence, is that black communities need more law and order, which I take to be shorthand

06:26.980 --> 06:30.540
for more policing, more stop and frisk, and more incarceration.

06:30.540 --> 06:34.860
Now from my angle, it looks like overly aggressive policing is what triggered the Baltimore uprising

06:34.860 --> 06:35.860
in the first place.

06:35.860 --> 06:39.460
But even if we were to concede that broken windows policing works, and it probably doesn't,

06:39.460 --> 06:42.620
we'd still have to explain why neighborhoods like the one where Freddie Gray grew up need

06:42.620 --> 06:44.460
so much policing in the first place.

06:44.460 --> 06:48.660
Now if I say the explanation is systemic racism, you might say that I'm just making excuses

06:48.660 --> 06:49.740
for rioters.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.260
But I promise that's not what I'm doing.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.260
In my opinion, every individual who decided to throw a brick at police or set a pharmacy

06:55.260 --> 06:58.640
on fire made the wrong decision, and I'm not trying to excuse them.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.860
I think they're assholes who did a lot of damage to their community for no gain.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.940
Like, this our community right here.

07:03.940 --> 07:08.860
We gotta go to these stores in the morning, and they ruined a lot of stores.

07:08.860 --> 07:12.420
I know some people defend riots on the ground that they bring attention to an issue, and

07:12.420 --> 07:16.460
it's true that CNN doesn't generally cover the persistent effects of housing discrimination,

07:16.460 --> 07:20.020
for instance, but when a black teenager sets a car on fire, every national news network

07:20.020 --> 07:21.820
has a team on site within the hour.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.740
But is this really the right kind of attention?

07:23.740 --> 07:27.300
In any case, the outright violent rioters were a small minority, but I think it's worth

07:27.300 --> 07:30.540
explaining how such a chaotic situation arose in the first place.

07:30.540 --> 07:34.060
Now I could jump right in and quote you a bunch of statistics about how poor West Baltimore

07:34.060 --> 07:38.060
is and how bad the schools are and how many of its residents are incarcerated and, more

07:38.060 --> 07:42.220
importantly, the political and historical reasons why, but the human mind doesn't process

07:42.220 --> 07:43.900
statistical information very well.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.340
It don't math good.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.420
So instead I'm going to zero in on the life of one person, Freddie Gray, and how the racist

07:49.420 --> 07:53.300
legacy of Baltimore's history basically led him from birth into that police van.

07:53.300 --> 07:59.100
Part c, the evidence.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.380
Your Honor, exhibit number n is lead paint.

08:02.380 --> 08:06.780
Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because

08:06.780 --> 08:09.220
it causes serious cognitive damage in children.

08:09.220 --> 08:13.420
Freddie Gray grew up in an old dilapidated row house in Sandtown Winchester with peeling

08:13.420 --> 08:16.540
lead paint, which you can see in this picture of Freddie as a child.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.700
Lead has a sweet taste and, despite its toxicity, it was used as a sweetener by the ancient

08:20.700 --> 08:24.380
Romans, which actually explains a lot.

08:24.380 --> 08:27.820
So when there are lots of lead paint chips lying around, kids like to eat them.

08:27.820 --> 08:32.620
When Freddie Gray's blood was tested when he was 22 months old in 1991, his blood carried

08:32.620 --> 08:35.100
37 micrograms of lead per deciliter.

08:35.100 --> 08:39.340
Jesus, Professor Levy gasped, the fact that Mr. Gray had these high levels of lead in

08:39.340 --> 08:43.340
all likelihood affected his ability to think and to self-regulate and profoundly affected

08:43.340 --> 08:45.700
his cognitive ability to process information.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.660
And the real tragedy of lead is that the damage it does is irreparable.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.100
The effects of lead on childhood development include diminished cognitive function and

08:52.100 --> 08:55.960
attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead

08:55.960 --> 08:59.740
are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up

08:59.740 --> 09:01.460
in the juvenile justice system.

09:01.460 --> 09:05.300
This, along with the poverty and the lack of opportunity, may help explain why Freddie

09:05.300 --> 09:09.700
Gray was, as conservative commentators were so fond of pointing out after the riots,

09:09.700 --> 09:12.160
no angel.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.580
Because only angels deserve not to mysteriously die in police custody.

09:15.580 --> 09:18.020
Freddie had a long rap sheet of drug and other minor offenses.

09:18.380 --> 09:22.820
He was also awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in a 2008 lead paint settlement

09:22.820 --> 09:24.300
structured to be paid out monthly.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.060
And you may be wondering, what happened to all that money?

09:27.060 --> 09:30.180
Why would someone who is getting monthly lead checks resort to selling drugs?

09:30.180 --> 09:32.460
Well, that is a fantastic question.

09:32.460 --> 09:33.780
Let's take a look.

09:33.780 --> 09:38.260
Over the past two decades, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's

09:38.260 --> 09:42.020
lead registry, and in Baltimore the vast majority of these children are black.

09:42.020 --> 09:45.660
Many of these kids are later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent

09:45.660 --> 09:46.660
brain damage.

09:46.660 --> 09:49.980
The settlements are structured to prevent mentally disabled and impulsive people from

09:49.980 --> 09:51.860
spending the money all at once.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.940
However, a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on these people, some

09:55.940 --> 09:59.500
of whom can't even read their contracts, and offer to buy their structured settlements

09:59.500 --> 10:03.240
in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.020
This is exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.

10:05.020 --> 10:11.100
In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for

10:11.100 --> 10:12.100
$18,300.

10:13.100 --> 10:18.220
They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the $435,000 Gray Siblings settlement

10:18.220 --> 10:20.220
for $54,000.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.380
Now you may be thinking, well that's shitty, but what does it have to do with racism?

10:23.380 --> 10:27.180
Well, take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore's neighborhoods with children with

10:27.180 --> 10:31.780
elevated lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's

10:31.780 --> 10:35.620
racial composition, where yellow dots stand for black residents and blue dots stand for

10:35.620 --> 10:36.620
white.

10:36.620 --> 10:37.620
Lead.

10:37.620 --> 10:38.620
Race.

10:38.620 --> 10:39.620
Lead.

10:39.620 --> 10:40.620
Race.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.740
That's exactly what the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

10:42.740 --> 10:47.460
You may be asking, why is Baltimore's racial segregation so pronounced, and why does lead

10:47.460 --> 10:49.180
poisoning correspond to race?

10:49.180 --> 10:52.060
Well, you are asking all the questions I want you to ask.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.060
Socrates would be proud.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.140
Part 4.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.140
Not in my neighborhood.

11:00.140 --> 11:05.460
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

11:05.460 --> 11:07.100
white Baltimore neighborhood.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.120
The uproar this produced among white residents was so severe that the city passed an ordinance

11:11.120 --> 11:14.340
mandating the segregation of every residential block.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.420
The ordinance, which the New York Times called the most pronounced Jim Crow measure on record,

11:18.420 --> 11:23.060
forbade blacks to take up residence on majority white blocks and vice versa, as well as requiring

11:23.060 --> 11:26.980
builders and contractors to specify which race new houses were intended for.

11:26.980 --> 11:31.100
When the Supreme Court overturned this type of ordinance in 1917, the Federal Housing

11:31.100 --> 11:36.220
Administration, the city, and white homeowners adopted subtler methods of enforcing segregation.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.980
For instance, 1.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.260
Restrictive covenants.

11:39.260 --> 11:44.540
After the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

11:44.540 --> 11:48.680
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure property owners in white neighborhoods

11:48.680 --> 11:52.260
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

11:52.260 --> 11:55.820
These covenants were enforced through strategic building and health code violations against

11:55.820 --> 11:59.420
owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

11:59.420 --> 12:00.420
2.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.420
Redlining.

12:01.420 --> 12:05.740
Redlining refers to the FHA's policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,

12:05.740 --> 12:09.180
which were colored in red on official maps, marking them as ineligible for government

12:09.180 --> 12:10.380
mortgage backing.

12:10.380 --> 12:17.180
The FHA was created in 1934 to promote home ownership by establishing a reliable credit

12:17.180 --> 12:18.820
system backed by the government.

12:18.820 --> 12:22.940
Since black families were excluded from this, they were left vulnerable to three, predatory

12:22.940 --> 12:23.940
lending.

12:23.940 --> 12:28.020
Baltimore laws allowed unscrupulous sellers to sign unfairly priced installment plans

12:28.020 --> 12:32.520
with abusive terms allowing homes to be repossessed and resold after one missed payment.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.040
Many black residents who couldn't get government backed mortgages had no choice but to buy

12:36.040 --> 12:40.520
into these outrageous contracts, and often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting

12:40.520 --> 12:44.280
repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and decay

12:44.280 --> 12:45.280
of black neighborhoods.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.720
And as if that wasn't bad enough, there was also

12:47.720 --> 12:48.720
4.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Blockbusting.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.680
Blockbusting describes the practice of horrible goddamn vulture real estate agents who'd

12:53.680 --> 12:58.120
promote fear of an impending minority takeover of a white neighborhood in order to basically

12:58.120 --> 13:02.040
trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below market prices.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.480
Again the villainous bastards would sell those same houses at extortionate prices to

13:05.480 --> 13:07.840
black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

13:07.840 --> 13:11.800
The total effects of restrictive covenants, redlining, predatory lending, and blockbusting

13:11.800 --> 13:14.000
were catastrophic for black communities.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.440
Black families were largely denied the benefits of the 1930s to 60s suburban boom that enabled

13:18.440 --> 13:21.320
so many white families to enjoy a middle class life.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.240
Instead, black families were often trapped in neighborhoods that succumbed to ghettoization,

13:25.240 --> 13:30.080
urban decay, bad schools, cyclical poverty and crime, and discriminatory policing that

13:30.080 --> 13:31.560
persists to this day.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.800
To get a sense for how all of this goes together, let's compare the original 1937 redlining

13:35.800 --> 13:40.960
map of Baltimore to the 2013 population by race map, to this map of Baltimore police

13:40.960 --> 13:45.560
stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

13:45.560 --> 13:49.960
recorded police stops of black pedestrians, and finally let's bring back the map of

13:49.960 --> 13:53.000
childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Hopefully the lead poisoning makes more sense now, since redlining and restrictive covenants

13:57.000 --> 14:01.160
historically forced blacks into ghettos, where predatory contracts made homeownership on

14:01.160 --> 14:06.080
affordable, leading to residential decay, including the persistence of old lead paint,

14:06.080 --> 14:10.160
which poisons children, making them more likely to drop out of school and commit crimes, and

14:10.160 --> 14:13.720
therefore wind up in the back of police vans like the one where Freddie Gray's spine

14:13.720 --> 14:17.800
was severed, leading to his death, and the consequent uprising and unrest.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.920
So when you say, there's no more legal discrimination against black people, so why don't they

14:21.920 --> 14:26.080
just stop complaining about racism already, you're being a fucking idiot.

14:26.080 --> 14:30.080
The effects of government backed discrimination don't go away just because the laws change.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.840
The discrimination is now built into the very structure of American cities, and that's

14:33.840 --> 14:37.400
a problem that's going to take a long time and a lot of work to undo, but it begins with

14:37.400 --> 14:42.400
rejecting racism and simplistic, surface-level non-solutions like broken windows policing.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.720
The flip side of this is that activism needs to be a lot more nuanced than fuck the police.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.960
Yeah, there are bad, violent, and bigoted cops, and yeah, there are official policies

14:50.960 --> 14:55.080
that enable brutality, including those that contributed to the dismissal of all charges

14:55.080 --> 14:58.360
against the six cops involved in the Freddie Gray homicide case.

14:58.360 --> 15:02.280
All of this should be strenuously opposed, but we also have to acknowledge that the problems

15:02.280 --> 15:07.960
of racial injustice go way deeper than anything the police can be expected to fix.

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
Part Next.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.960
What Do.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.960
When I think about Freddie Gray's life, from the childhood lead poisoning, to the

15:12.960 --> 15:17.280
exploitative purchase of his settlement, to his quite possibly groundless arrest, to the

15:17.280 --> 15:21.800
fatal injury he sustained in police custody, what I see is a whole system of institutions

15:21.800 --> 15:24.680
that basically treat black lives as if they don't matter.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.080
If only there was some kind of activist organization dedicated to opposing that situation.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
Hmm.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.800
I'm coming up blank.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.120
Now I'm not an expert in this stuff, so feel free to correct or add to my suggestions

15:35.120 --> 15:39.040
in the comments, but it seems to me that what's needed most are political solutions.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.800
For instance, education reform in cities with bad schools, non-discriminatory access to

15:43.800 --> 15:47.880
non-predatory home loans, and, of course, police reform.

15:47.880 --> 15:52.080
Black Lives Matter affiliate Campaign Zero's website lists ten policy suggestions to address

15:52.080 --> 15:54.440
the police issue that I think look pretty good.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.920
Unfortunately, because of the results of the 2016 election, things are probably going

15:57.920 --> 15:59.560
to get worse before they get better.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.060
It's clear that this country's attitudes about race are still pretty fucking benighted.

16:03.060 --> 16:07.120
People who get their information from cable news or god help us, YouTube, are generally

16:07.120 --> 16:08.840
pretty ignorant about this stuff.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.760
So one thing we can all do is try to engage people a little bit.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.080
If you see someone saying some racist or ignorant shit, I mean, it's not like you're going

16:15.080 --> 16:18.640
to convince them, but you can try to make them a little less confident in their ignorance.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.960
And maybe, over time, those sorts of conversations will add up.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.760
And of course, you've got to be real gentle about it, because, well, white people can

16:25.760 --> 16:29.280
be pretty sensitive about this, and they will spring on you like a bear trap if they think

16:29.280 --> 16:30.480
you're calling them racist.

16:30.480 --> 16:34.400
So, tread lightly, try not to act like too much of a self-righteous college student,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.480
and cultivate the patience of a monk.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.480
Or drink a lot.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.920
I mean, it's really the least you can do, especially if you're white.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.440
And I know a lot of white people think, well, slavery and Jim Crow are over, and I wasn't

16:44.440 --> 16:50.200
even born yet, so it's not my fault, why is everyone blaming me when it's not my responsibility?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.680
Man, fuck that shit.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.200
As a white person, I personally feel a basic minimum duty to try and get informed about

16:55.200 --> 16:59.080
this kind of thing, at the very least, because the world is bad, and it's bad in ways that

16:59.080 --> 17:02.840
benefit me, so if you feel entitled to stay in your bubble and not think about anyone

17:02.840 --> 17:06.040
else's problems, well, that just kind of sucks.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.440
Well, thanks for watching the video.

17:09.440 --> 17:14.000
If you want to help me make more semi-informative burlesques about this kind of topic, pledging

17:14.000 --> 17:18.240
a couple dollars a video on Patreon goes a long way for me, but only if you want to.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.440
I am very pleased to have a lot of new patrons this month, so a huge thanks goes out to Michael

17:22.440 --> 17:28.520
C. Johnson, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett Lathy, Robert Phillips, Kat Stas,

17:28.520 --> 17:35.480
Ben Adamson, Ray Hung, Romi Koya, Aaron Ho, Muza Vaino, Colin Soper, Neil Tak, Stealer

17:35.480 --> 17:42.440
of Souls, Vorone, NoNoNo, Bottled Sky, Raymond Heinrich, Heterodox, Roman Olushev, and all

17:42.440 --> 17:44.840
the rest of you who make it possible for me to do this.

17:44.840 --> 17:45.840
Y'all are great.

17:48.240 --> 17:58.840
I'll see you next time.
