0	9400	On the morning of April 12, 2015, three police officers on bike patrol near a housing project
9400	14000	in West Baltimore made eye contact with a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray.
14000	18960	When Freddie fled the police on sight, he was chased down, arrested for carrying a spring-assisted
18960	21540	knife and dragged into a police van.
21540	24580	The van made four stops before returning to the police station.
24580	28080	At the first stop, Freddie was unloaded and shackled in leg irons and returned to the
28080	29420	van without a seatbelt.
29420	33100	He requested medical assistance, a request that the police ignored.
33100	36700	When the van arrived at the police station, Freddie had lapsed into a coma, with three
36700	40340	fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.
40340	45220	In the following days, the BPD released contradictory and inadequate accounts of Freddie's arrest.
45220	49500	On April 18, hundreds of Baltimore citizens protested outside the Western District police
49500	50680	station.
50680	55460	The next day, Freddie died of his spinal injury, exactly one week after his arrest.
55460	56960	Protests continued and escalated.
56960	67320	Police began wearing riot gear, but the first week of protests was almost entirely peaceful.
67320	71800	On April 25, thousands of protesters marched from the Western District to City Hall, demanding
71800	74840	prosecution of the officers involved in Freddie's death.
74840	78640	When crowds dispersed after protest leaders finished speaking, a large group marched to
78640	84840	Camden Yards, where a kind of trash battle broke out at Pickles Pub.
84840	92280	Some storefronts and car windows were smashed, and hundreds of riot police arrived to disperse
92280	94280	the protesters.
94280	98840	Two days later, on April 27, Freddie Gray's funeral was attended by hundreds of people,
98840	101640	including several politicians and civil rights leaders.
101640	106020	Meanwhile, police took preemptive action in response to plans spread by black high school
106020	110920	students on social media to enact a purge situation beginning at Mondawmin Mall.
110920	115000	Police shut down the Mondawmin metro station and cordoned off the area, debussing all students
115000	117600	from Frederick Douglass High School across the street.
117600	120920	The students were essentially quarantined by the police, with no way to get home.
120920	125360	When the teenagers became unruly, a phalanx of riot police closed in on the area, firing
125360	139400	plastic bullets into the crowd.
139400	143680	Police arrested hundreds of people, and constitutional rights were suspended as prisoners were detained
143680	146040	for up to 50 hours without a charge.
146040	149800	Confrontations between protesters and police turned violent as the conflict spread through
149800	153280	West Baltimore, where rioters began throwing rocks at the police.
153280	158000	Then some fucking idiot set fire to the Pennsylvania Avenue CVS, and an even bigger fucking idiot
158000	162280	set fire to the construction site of a senior center on the other side of the city.
162280	166040	The mayor and governor declared a state of emergency, and a city-wide curfew was ordered
166040	167200	for the next four nights.
170400	174800	Residents from all over the city assembled in the following days to assist with a cleanup effort.
174800	178480	Sifting through the footage of the riots and their aftermath, you find images of political
178480	182640	uprising and resilient humanity, as well as aimless looting and violence.
182640	186040	Unfortunately, the impression given by the international media was essentially that the
186040	188760	entire city went up in flames, which is simply not true.
188760	192320	But to this day, when I tell people I live in Baltimore, they react like I said I'm from
192320	193320	South Sudan.
193320	198140	At the time of the unrest, I still lived in Chicago, where I watched all this unfold online.
198140	202700	One thing that made an impression on me was a certain tendency of online commenters responding
202700	204460	to videos of the uprising.
204460	207960	And seeing as we've just elected our first comments section president, I think it's worth
207960	212020	taking a look at this, not just to gawk, but to face head-on the ugly fact that some of
212020	216020	the worst damage done by ghetto riots is a terrible reaction they often provoke from
216020	217940	white people with more opinions than thoughts.
217940	222460	Now I'll warn you, this is about to get about as racist as words on the screen can be, so
222460	226020	raise yourself captain, a raging storm of hate approaches.
226020	229940	These people give others a reason to be racist when they act like complete hooligan APES
229940	232500	running through towns and burning and looting stores.
232500	235380	They are an embarrassment to the human race and are sub-humans, IMO.
235380	239260	I don't want to be that guy, but we gotta do something about the blacks.
239260	240660	Where is Hitler when we need him?
240660	241660	Shit.
241660	242740	What part of Africa is this?
242740	244180	Baltimore, Africa.
244180	245780	Bunch of starving monkey.
245780	247280	Obama-esque America.
247280	249980	Not even a deadly bacteria is worse than these mongrels.
249980	251100	Another major chimp-out.
251100	252340	This was to be expected.
252340	254860	Break out the high pressure fire hoses and the vicious dogs.
254860	257340	Let the peaceful protests begin.
257340	259100	Jungle bunny Disneyland.
259100	261020	And that's why they're called savages.
261020	263940	This only confirms what most think of you already, animals.
263940	266820	And black people still wonder why they can't be accepted in society.
266820	270180	Without white people, the zoo animals will be running around naked, hunting each other
270180	271180	for food.
271180	272600	Diversity and action.
272600	274860	They need to build more jails or zoos.
274860	275860	Disgusting!
275860	277180	Street trash, they've ruined our cities.
277180	279500	This is the wildest chimp-out I've ever seen.
279500	282340	Blacks really are sub-human for fuck's sake, animals.
282340	286220	I would have loved to be there with my AR-15 and just unload into these monkeys.
286220	287700	That would have been so fulfilling.
287700	289340	This is why I hate shit.
289340	290600	92 thumbs up.
290600	293220	Our cities used to be safe, but now we have diversity.
293220	295060	Bitch don't build.
295060	297620	They destroy or complain about welfare.
297620	298620	End welfare.
298620	300300	Put the bitch to work.
300300	301680	Let them starve!
301680	303400	Make them starve to death.
303400	305900	Maybe they'll stop breading targets.
305900	307500	Black people are animals.
307500	311940	Death to all bitches will always be violent like uncivilized people.
311940	313180	Not gentle people.
313180	314540	Cun nut AK.
314540	315540	Africa.
315540	317020	Blacks are most racist people.
317020	318860	Time to put these animals in cages.
318860	320180	Savage African half-apes.
320180	321180	Stop!
321180	328580	I am the social justice police, and you're under arrest for racism.
328580	338140	Seriously though, anyone still want to argue that racism is over?
338140	341380	Now would be the time to leave a comment arguing that there's no such thing as racism.
341380	342980	Collarum, Johnson.
342980	343980	Part...ugh.
343980	345980	Why so racist?
345980	349820	So how do we stop this?
349820	354180	Well, one way might be to try to spread awareness of the circumstances that lead this to happen.
354180	357460	And that's worth doing anyway, since if we know what leads to this, we can start thinking
357460	358460	about how to prevent it.
358460	362340	Overt racial hate was obviously a big part of white America's response to the Baltimore
362340	366700	Riots, and to any number of other uprisings before and after, and it'll likely be no different
366700	368260	with similar events in the future.
368260	371940	But perhaps even more common and damaging is simple ignorance and misinformation about
371940	375500	the causes of these things, and also therefore about the right ways to prevent them.
375500	380300	The solution proposed by our dear god, president-elect, and also by racists, but I'm sure that's just
380300	386980	a coincidence, is that black communities need more law and order, which I take to be shorthand
386980	390540	for more policing, more stop and frisk, and more incarceration.
390540	394860	Now from my angle, it looks like overly aggressive policing is what triggered the Baltimore uprising
394860	395860	in the first place.
395860	399460	But even if we were to concede that broken windows policing works, and it probably doesn't,
399460	402620	we'd still have to explain why neighborhoods like the one where Freddie Gray grew up need
402620	404460	so much policing in the first place.
404460	408660	Now if I say the explanation is systemic racism, you might say that I'm just making excuses
408660	409740	for rioters.
409740	411260	But I promise that's not what I'm doing.
411260	415260	In my opinion, every individual who decided to throw a brick at police or set a pharmacy
415260	418640	on fire made the wrong decision, and I'm not trying to excuse them.
418640	421860	I think they're assholes who did a lot of damage to their community for no gain.
421860	423940	Like, this our community right here.
423940	428860	We gotta go to these stores in the morning, and they ruined a lot of stores.
428860	432420	I know some people defend riots on the ground that they bring attention to an issue, and
432420	436460	it's true that CNN doesn't generally cover the persistent effects of housing discrimination,
436460	440020	for instance, but when a black teenager sets a car on fire, every national news network
440020	441820	has a team on site within the hour.
441820	443740	But is this really the right kind of attention?
443740	447300	In any case, the outright violent rioters were a small minority, but I think it's worth
447300	450540	explaining how such a chaotic situation arose in the first place.
450540	454060	Now I could jump right in and quote you a bunch of statistics about how poor West Baltimore
454060	458060	is and how bad the schools are and how many of its residents are incarcerated and, more
458060	462220	importantly, the political and historical reasons why, but the human mind doesn't process
462220	463900	statistical information very well.
463900	465340	It don't math good.
465340	469420	So instead I'm going to zero in on the life of one person, Freddie Gray, and how the racist
469420	473300	legacy of Baltimore's history basically led him from birth into that police van.
473300	479100	Part c, the evidence.
479100	482380	Your Honor, exhibit number n is lead paint.
482380	486780	Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because
486780	489220	it causes serious cognitive damage in children.
489220	493420	Freddie Gray grew up in an old dilapidated row house in Sandtown Winchester with peeling
493420	496540	lead paint, which you can see in this picture of Freddie as a child.
496540	500700	Lead has a sweet taste and, despite its toxicity, it was used as a sweetener by the ancient
500700	504380	Romans, which actually explains a lot.
504380	507820	So when there are lots of lead paint chips lying around, kids like to eat them.
507820	512620	When Freddie Gray's blood was tested when he was 22 months old in 1991, his blood carried
512620	515100	37 micrograms of lead per deciliter.
515100	519340	Jesus, Professor Levy gasped, the fact that Mr. Gray had these high levels of lead in
519340	523340	all likelihood affected his ability to think and to self-regulate and profoundly affected
523340	525700	his cognitive ability to process information.
525700	528660	And the real tragedy of lead is that the damage it does is irreparable.
528660	532100	The effects of lead on childhood development include diminished cognitive function and
532100	535960	attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead
535960	539740	are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up
539740	541460	in the juvenile justice system.
541460	545300	This, along with the poverty and the lack of opportunity, may help explain why Freddie
545300	549700	Gray was, as conservative commentators were so fond of pointing out after the riots,
549700	552160	no angel.
552160	555580	Because only angels deserve not to mysteriously die in police custody.
555580	558020	Freddie had a long rap sheet of drug and other minor offenses.
558380	562820	He was also awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in a 2008 lead paint settlement
562820	564300	structured to be paid out monthly.
564300	567060	And you may be wondering, what happened to all that money?
567060	570180	Why would someone who is getting monthly lead checks resort to selling drugs?
570180	572460	Well, that is a fantastic question.
572460	573780	Let's take a look.
573780	578260	Over the past two decades, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's
578260	582020	lead registry, and in Baltimore the vast majority of these children are black.
582020	585660	Many of these kids are later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent
585660	586660	brain damage.
586660	589980	The settlements are structured to prevent mentally disabled and impulsive people from
589980	591860	spending the money all at once.
591860	595940	However, a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on these people, some
595940	599500	of whom can't even read their contracts, and offer to buy their structured settlements
599500	603240	in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.
603240	605020	This is exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.
605020	611100	In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for
611100	612100	$18,300.
613100	618220	They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the $435,000 Gray Siblings settlement
618220	620220	for $54,000.
620220	623380	Now you may be thinking, well that's shitty, but what does it have to do with racism?
623380	627180	Well, take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore's neighborhoods with children with
627180	631780	elevated lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's
631780	635620	racial composition, where yellow dots stand for black residents and blue dots stand for
635620	636620	white.
636620	637620	Lead.
637620	638620	Race.
638620	639620	Lead.
639620	640620	Race.
640620	642740	That's exactly what the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.
642740	647460	You may be asking, why is Baltimore's racial segregation so pronounced, and why does lead
647460	649180	poisoning correspond to race?
649180	652060	Well, you are asking all the questions I want you to ask.
652060	653060	Socrates would be proud.
657060	659140	Part 4.
659140	660140	Not in my neighborhood.
660140	665460	In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious
665460	667100	white Baltimore neighborhood.
667100	671120	The uproar this produced among white residents was so severe that the city passed an ordinance
671120	674340	mandating the segregation of every residential block.
674340	678420	The ordinance, which the New York Times called the most pronounced Jim Crow measure on record,
678420	683060	forbade blacks to take up residence on majority white blocks and vice versa, as well as requiring
683060	686980	builders and contractors to specify which race new houses were intended for.
686980	691100	When the Supreme Court overturned this type of ordinance in 1917, the Federal Housing
691100	696220	Administration, the city, and white homeowners adopted subtler methods of enforcing segregation.
696220	697980	For instance, 1.
697980	699260	Restrictive covenants.
699260	704540	After the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,
704540	708680	which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure property owners in white neighborhoods
708680	712260	to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.
712260	715820	These covenants were enforced through strategic building and health code violations against
715820	719420	owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.
719420	720420	2.
720420	721420	Redlining.
721420	725740	Redlining refers to the FHA's policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,
725740	729180	which were colored in red on official maps, marking them as ineligible for government
729180	730380	mortgage backing.
730380	737180	The FHA was created in 1934 to promote home ownership by establishing a reliable credit
737180	738820	system backed by the government.
738820	742940	Since black families were excluded from this, they were left vulnerable to three, predatory
742940	743940	lending.
743940	748020	Baltimore laws allowed unscrupulous sellers to sign unfairly priced installment plans
748020	752520	with abusive terms allowing homes to be repossessed and resold after one missed payment.
752520	756040	Many black residents who couldn't get government backed mortgages had no choice but to buy
756040	760520	into these outrageous contracts, and often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting
760520	764280	repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and decay
764280	765280	of black neighborhoods.
765280	767720	And as if that wasn't bad enough, there was also
767720	768720	4.
768720	769720	Blockbusting.
769720	773680	Blockbusting describes the practice of horrible goddamn vulture real estate agents who'd
773680	778120	promote fear of an impending minority takeover of a white neighborhood in order to basically
778120	782040	trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below market prices.
782040	785480	Again the villainous bastards would sell those same houses at extortionate prices to
785480	787840	black families desperate to escape the ghetto.
787840	791800	The total effects of restrictive covenants, redlining, predatory lending, and blockbusting
791800	794000	were catastrophic for black communities.
794000	798440	Black families were largely denied the benefits of the 1930s to 60s suburban boom that enabled
798440	801320	so many white families to enjoy a middle class life.
801320	805240	Instead, black families were often trapped in neighborhoods that succumbed to ghettoization,
805240	810080	urban decay, bad schools, cyclical poverty and crime, and discriminatory policing that
810080	811560	persists to this day.
811600	815800	To get a sense for how all of this goes together, let's compare the original 1937 redlining
815800	820960	map of Baltimore to the 2013 population by race map, to this map of Baltimore police
820960	825560	stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing
825560	829960	recorded police stops of black pedestrians, and finally let's bring back the map of
829960	833000	childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.
833000	837000	Hopefully the lead poisoning makes more sense now, since redlining and restrictive covenants
837000	841160	historically forced blacks into ghettos, where predatory contracts made homeownership on
841160	846080	affordable, leading to residential decay, including the persistence of old lead paint,
846080	850160	which poisons children, making them more likely to drop out of school and commit crimes, and
850160	853720	therefore wind up in the back of police vans like the one where Freddie Gray's spine
853720	857800	was severed, leading to his death, and the consequent uprising and unrest.
857800	861920	So when you say, there's no more legal discrimination against black people, so why don't they
861920	866080	just stop complaining about racism already, you're being a fucking idiot.
866080	870080	The effects of government backed discrimination don't go away just because the laws change.
870080	873840	The discrimination is now built into the very structure of American cities, and that's
873840	877400	a problem that's going to take a long time and a lot of work to undo, but it begins with
877400	882400	rejecting racism and simplistic, surface-level non-solutions like broken windows policing.
882400	886720	The flip side of this is that activism needs to be a lot more nuanced than fuck the police.
886720	890960	Yeah, there are bad, violent, and bigoted cops, and yeah, there are official policies
890960	895080	that enable brutality, including those that contributed to the dismissal of all charges
895080	898360	against the six cops involved in the Freddie Gray homicide case.
898360	902280	All of this should be strenuously opposed, but we also have to acknowledge that the problems
902280	907960	of racial injustice go way deeper than anything the police can be expected to fix.
907960	908960	Part Next.
908960	909960	What Do.
909960	912960	When I think about Freddie Gray's life, from the childhood lead poisoning, to the
912960	917280	exploitative purchase of his settlement, to his quite possibly groundless arrest, to the
917280	921800	fatal injury he sustained in police custody, what I see is a whole system of institutions
921800	924680	that basically treat black lives as if they don't matter.
924680	929080	If only there was some kind of activist organization dedicated to opposing that situation.
929080	930080	Hmm.
930080	931800	I'm coming up blank.
931800	935120	Now I'm not an expert in this stuff, so feel free to correct or add to my suggestions
935120	939040	in the comments, but it seems to me that what's needed most are political solutions.
939040	943800	For instance, education reform in cities with bad schools, non-discriminatory access to
943800	947880	non-predatory home loans, and, of course, police reform.
947880	952080	Black Lives Matter affiliate Campaign Zero's website lists ten policy suggestions to address
952080	954440	the police issue that I think look pretty good.
954440	957920	Unfortunately, because of the results of the 2016 election, things are probably going
957920	959560	to get worse before they get better.
959560	963060	It's clear that this country's attitudes about race are still pretty fucking benighted.
963060	967120	People who get their information from cable news or god help us, YouTube, are generally
967120	968840	pretty ignorant about this stuff.
968840	971760	So one thing we can all do is try to engage people a little bit.
971760	975080	If you see someone saying some racist or ignorant shit, I mean, it's not like you're going
975080	978640	to convince them, but you can try to make them a little less confident in their ignorance.
978640	981960	And maybe, over time, those sorts of conversations will add up.
982200	985760	And of course, you've got to be real gentle about it, because, well, white people can
985760	989280	be pretty sensitive about this, and they will spring on you like a bear trap if they think
989280	990480	you're calling them racist.
990480	994400	So, tread lightly, try not to act like too much of a self-righteous college student,
994400	996480	and cultivate the patience of a monk.
996480	997480	Or drink a lot.
997480	999920	I mean, it's really the least you can do, especially if you're white.
999920	1004440	And I know a lot of white people think, well, slavery and Jim Crow are over, and I wasn't
1004440	1010200	even born yet, so it's not my fault, why is everyone blaming me when it's not my responsibility?
1010200	1011680	Man, fuck that shit.
1011680	1015200	As a white person, I personally feel a basic minimum duty to try and get informed about
1015200	1019080	this kind of thing, at the very least, because the world is bad, and it's bad in ways that
1019080	1022840	benefit me, so if you feel entitled to stay in your bubble and not think about anyone
1022840	1026040	else's problems, well, that just kind of sucks.
1028040	1029440	Well, thanks for watching the video.
1029440	1034000	If you want to help me make more semi-informative burlesques about this kind of topic, pledging
1034000	1038240	a couple dollars a video on Patreon goes a long way for me, but only if you want to.
1038320	1042440	I am very pleased to have a lot of new patrons this month, so a huge thanks goes out to Michael
1042440	1048520	C. Johnson, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett Lathy, Robert Phillips, Kat Stas,
1048520	1055480	Ben Adamson, Ray Hung, Romi Koya, Aaron Ho, Muza Vaino, Colin Soper, Neil Tak, Stealer
1055480	1062440	of Souls, Vorone, NoNoNo, Bottled Sky, Raymond Heinrich, Heterodox, Roman Olushev, and all
1062440	1064840	the rest of you who make it possible for me to do this.
1064840	1065840	Y'all are great.
1068240	1078840	I'll see you next time.
