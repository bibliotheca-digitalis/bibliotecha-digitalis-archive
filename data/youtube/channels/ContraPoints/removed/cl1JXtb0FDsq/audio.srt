1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
On the morning of April 12, 2015, three police officers on bike patrol near a housing project

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,000
in West Baltimore made eye contact with a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
When Freddie fled the police on sight, he was chased down, arrested for carrying a spring-assisted

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,540
knife and dragged into a police van.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,580
The van made four stops before returning to the police station.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,080
At the first stop, Freddie was unloaded and shackled in leg irons and returned to the

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,420
van without a seatbelt.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,100
He requested medical assistance, a request that the police ignored.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,700
When the van arrived at the police station, Freddie had lapsed into a coma, with three

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,340
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,220
In the following days, the BPD released contradictory and inadequate accounts of Freddie's arrest.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,500
On April 18, hundreds of Baltimore citizens protested outside the Western District police

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,680
station.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,460
The next day, Freddie died of his spinal injury, exactly one week after his arrest.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,960
Protests continued and escalated.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:07,320
Police began wearing riot gear, but the first week of protests was almost entirely peaceful.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,800
On April 25, thousands of protesters marched from the Western District to City Hall, demanding

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,840
prosecution of the officers involved in Freddie's death.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,640
When crowds dispersed after protest leaders finished speaking, a large group marched to

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,840
Camden Yards, where a kind of trash battle broke out at Pickles Pub.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Some storefronts and car windows were smashed, and hundreds of riot police arrived to disperse

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
the protesters.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,840
Two days later, on April 27, Freddie Gray's funeral was attended by hundreds of people,

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,640
including several politicians and civil rights leaders.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,020
Meanwhile, police took preemptive action in response to plans spread by black high school

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,920
students on social media to enact a purge situation beginning at Mondawmin Mall.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,000
Police shut down the Mondawmin metro station and cordoned off the area, debussing all students

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,600
from Frederick Douglass High School across the street.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,920
The students were essentially quarantined by the police, with no way to get home.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,360
When the teenagers became unruly, a phalanx of riot police closed in on the area, firing

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:19,400
plastic bullets into the crowd.

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,680
Police arrested hundreds of people, and constitutional rights were suspended as prisoners were detained

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,040
for up to 50 hours without a charge.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,800
Confrontations between protesters and police turned violent as the conflict spread through

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,280
West Baltimore, where rioters began throwing rocks at the police.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Then some fucking idiot set fire to the Pennsylvania Avenue CVS, and an even bigger fucking idiot

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,280
set fire to the construction site of a senior center on the other side of the city.

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,040
The mayor and governor declared a state of emergency, and a city-wide curfew was ordered

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
for the next four nights.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Residents from all over the city assembled in the following days to assist with a cleanup effort.

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
Sifting through the footage of the riots and their aftermath, you find images of political

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,640
uprising and resilient humanity, as well as aimless looting and violence.

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,040
Unfortunately, the impression given by the international media was essentially that the

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,760
entire city went up in flames, which is simply not true.

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,320
But to this day, when I tell people I live in Baltimore, they react like I said I'm from

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
South Sudan.

47
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,140
At the time of the unrest, I still lived in Chicago, where I watched all this unfold online.

48
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,700
One thing that made an impression on me was a certain tendency of online commenters responding

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,460
to videos of the uprising.

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,960
And seeing as we've just elected our first comments section president, I think it's worth

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,020
taking a look at this, not just to gawk, but to face head-on the ugly fact that some of

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,020
the worst damage done by ghetto riots is a terrible reaction they often provoke from

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,940
white people with more opinions than thoughts.

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,460
Now I'll warn you, this is about to get about as racist as words on the screen can be, so

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,020
raise yourself captain, a raging storm of hate approaches.

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,940
These people give others a reason to be racist when they act like complete hooligan APES

57
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,500
running through towns and burning and looting stores.

58
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,380
They are an embarrassment to the human race and are sub-humans, IMO.

59
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,260
I don't want to be that guy, but we gotta do something about the blacks.

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,660
Where is Hitler when we need him?

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Shit.

62
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,740
What part of Africa is this?

63
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,180
Baltimore, Africa.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,780
Bunch of starving monkey.

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,280
Obama-esque America.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,980
Not even a deadly bacteria is worse than these mongrels.

67
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,100
Another major chimp-out.

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,340
This was to be expected.

69
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,860
Break out the high pressure fire hoses and the vicious dogs.

70
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,340
Let the peaceful protests begin.

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Jungle bunny Disneyland.

72
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,020
And that's why they're called savages.

73
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,940
This only confirms what most think of you already, animals.

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,820
And black people still wonder why they can't be accepted in society.

75
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,180
Without white people, the zoo animals will be running around naked, hunting each other

76
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
for food.

77
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,600
Diversity and action.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,860
They need to build more jails or zoos.

79
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
Disgusting!

80
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,180
Street trash, they've ruined our cities.

81
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,500
This is the wildest chimp-out I've ever seen.

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,340
Blacks really are sub-human for fuck's sake, animals.

83
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,220
I would have loved to be there with my AR-15 and just unload into these monkeys.

84
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,700
That would have been so fulfilling.

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,340
This is why I hate shit.

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,600
92 thumbs up.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,220
Our cities used to be safe, but now we have diversity.

88
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,060
Bitch don't build.

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,620
They destroy or complain about welfare.

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
End welfare.

91
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,300
Put the bitch to work.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,680
Let them starve!

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,400
Make them starve to death.

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,900
Maybe they'll stop breading targets.

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
Black people are animals.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,940
Death to all bitches will always be violent like uncivilized people.

97
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,180
Not gentle people.

98
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,540
Cun nut AK.

99
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Africa.

100
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,020
Blacks are most racist people.

101
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,860
Time to put these animals in cages.

102
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,180
Savage African half-apes.

103
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,180
Stop!

104
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,580
I am the social justice police, and you're under arrest for racism.

105
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:38,140
Seriously though, anyone still want to argue that racism is over?

106
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,380
Now would be the time to leave a comment arguing that there's no such thing as racism.

107
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,980
Collarum, Johnson.

108
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Part...ugh.

109
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Why so racist?

110
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,820
So how do we stop this?

111
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,180
Well, one way might be to try to spread awareness of the circumstances that lead this to happen.

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,460
And that's worth doing anyway, since if we know what leads to this, we can start thinking

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
about how to prevent it.

114
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,340
Overt racial hate was obviously a big part of white America's response to the Baltimore

115
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,700
Riots, and to any number of other uprisings before and after, and it'll likely be no different

116
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,260
with similar events in the future.

117
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,940
But perhaps even more common and damaging is simple ignorance and misinformation about

118
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,500
the causes of these things, and also therefore about the right ways to prevent them.

119
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,300
The solution proposed by our dear god, president-elect, and also by racists, but I'm sure that's just

120
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,980
a coincidence, is that black communities need more law and order, which I take to be shorthand

121
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,540
for more policing, more stop and frisk, and more incarceration.

122
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,860
Now from my angle, it looks like overly aggressive policing is what triggered the Baltimore uprising

123
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
in the first place.

124
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,460
But even if we were to concede that broken windows policing works, and it probably doesn't,

125
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,620
we'd still have to explain why neighborhoods like the one where Freddie Gray grew up need

126
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,460
so much policing in the first place.

127
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,660
Now if I say the explanation is systemic racism, you might say that I'm just making excuses

128
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,740
for rioters.

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,260
But I promise that's not what I'm doing.

130
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,260
In my opinion, every individual who decided to throw a brick at police or set a pharmacy

131
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,640
on fire made the wrong decision, and I'm not trying to excuse them.

132
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,860
I think they're assholes who did a lot of damage to their community for no gain.

133
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,940
Like, this our community right here.

134
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,860
We gotta go to these stores in the morning, and they ruined a lot of stores.

135
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,420
I know some people defend riots on the ground that they bring attention to an issue, and

136
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,460
it's true that CNN doesn't generally cover the persistent effects of housing discrimination,

137
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,020
for instance, but when a black teenager sets a car on fire, every national news network

138
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,820
has a team on site within the hour.

139
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,740
But is this really the right kind of attention?

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,300
In any case, the outright violent rioters were a small minority, but I think it's worth

141
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,540
explaining how such a chaotic situation arose in the first place.

142
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,060
Now I could jump right in and quote you a bunch of statistics about how poor West Baltimore

143
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,060
is and how bad the schools are and how many of its residents are incarcerated and, more

144
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,220
importantly, the political and historical reasons why, but the human mind doesn't process

145
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,900
statistical information very well.

146
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,340
It don't math good.

147
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,420
So instead I'm going to zero in on the life of one person, Freddie Gray, and how the racist

148
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,300
legacy of Baltimore's history basically led him from birth into that police van.

149
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,100
Part c, the evidence.

150
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,380
Your Honor, exhibit number n is lead paint.

151
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,780
Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress banned it in 1978 because

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,220
it causes serious cognitive damage in children.

153
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,420
Freddie Gray grew up in an old dilapidated row house in Sandtown Winchester with peeling

154
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,540
lead paint, which you can see in this picture of Freddie as a child.

155
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,700
Lead has a sweet taste and, despite its toxicity, it was used as a sweetener by the ancient

156
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,380
Romans, which actually explains a lot.

157
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,820
So when there are lots of lead paint chips lying around, kids like to eat them.

158
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,620
When Freddie Gray's blood was tested when he was 22 months old in 1991, his blood carried

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,100
37 micrograms of lead per deciliter.

160
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,340
Jesus, Professor Levy gasped, the fact that Mr. Gray had these high levels of lead in

161
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,340
all likelihood affected his ability to think and to self-regulate and profoundly affected

162
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,700
his cognitive ability to process information.

163
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,660
And the real tragedy of lead is that the damage it does is irreparable.

164
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,100
The effects of lead on childhood development include diminished cognitive function and

165
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,960
attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead

166
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,740
are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up

167
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,460
in the juvenile justice system.

168
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,300
This, along with the poverty and the lack of opportunity, may help explain why Freddie

169
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,700
Gray was, as conservative commentators were so fond of pointing out after the riots,

170
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,160
no angel.

171
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,580
Because only angels deserve not to mysteriously die in police custody.

172
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,020
Freddie had a long rap sheet of drug and other minor offenses.

173
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,820
He was also awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in a 2008 lead paint settlement

174
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,300
structured to be paid out monthly.

175
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,060
And you may be wondering, what happened to all that money?

176
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,180
Why would someone who is getting monthly lead checks resort to selling drugs?

177
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,460
Well, that is a fantastic question.

178
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,780
Let's take a look.

179
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,260
Over the past two decades, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been added to Maryland's

180
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,020
lead registry, and in Baltimore the vast majority of these children are black.

181
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,660
Many of these kids are later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent

182
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
brain damage.

183
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,980
The settlements are structured to prevent mentally disabled and impulsive people from

184
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,860
spending the money all at once.

185
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,940
However, a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on these people, some

186
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,500
of whom can't even read their contracts, and offer to buy their structured settlements

187
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,240
in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,020
This is exactly what happened to Freddie Gray.

189
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,100
In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for

190
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
$18,300.

191
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,220
They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the $435,000 Gray Siblings settlement

192
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,220
for $54,000.

193
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,380
Now you may be thinking, well that's shitty, but what does it have to do with racism?

194
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,180
Well, take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore's neighborhoods with children with

195
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,780
elevated lead levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's

196
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,620
racial composition, where yellow dots stand for black residents and blue dots stand for

197
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
white.

198
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Lead.

199
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Race.

200
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Lead.

201
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
Race.

202
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,740
That's exactly what the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

203
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,460
You may be asking, why is Baltimore's racial segregation so pronounced, and why does lead

204
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,180
poisoning correspond to race?

205
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,060
Well, you are asking all the questions I want you to ask.

206
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Socrates would be proud.

207
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,140
Part 4.

208
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Not in my neighborhood.

209
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,460
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

210
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,100
white Baltimore neighborhood.

211
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,120
The uproar this produced among white residents was so severe that the city passed an ordinance

212
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,340
mandating the segregation of every residential block.

213
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,420
The ordinance, which the New York Times called the most pronounced Jim Crow measure on record,

214
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,060
forbade blacks to take up residence on majority white blocks and vice versa, as well as requiring

215
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,980
builders and contractors to specify which race new houses were intended for.

216
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,100
When the Supreme Court overturned this type of ordinance in 1917, the Federal Housing

217
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,220
Administration, the city, and white homeowners adopted subtler methods of enforcing segregation.

218
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,980
For instance, 1.

219
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,260
Restrictive covenants.

220
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,540
After the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

221
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,680
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure property owners in white neighborhoods

222
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,260
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

223
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,820
These covenants were enforced through strategic building and health code violations against

224
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,420
owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

225
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
2.

226
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Redlining.

227
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,740
Redlining refers to the FHA's policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,

228
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,180
which were colored in red on official maps, marking them as ineligible for government

229
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,380
mortgage backing.

230
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,180
The FHA was created in 1934 to promote home ownership by establishing a reliable credit

231
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,820
system backed by the government.

232
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,940
Since black families were excluded from this, they were left vulnerable to three, predatory

233
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
lending.

234
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,020
Baltimore laws allowed unscrupulous sellers to sign unfairly priced installment plans

235
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,520
with abusive terms allowing homes to be repossessed and resold after one missed payment.

236
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,040
Many black residents who couldn't get government backed mortgages had no choice but to buy

237
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,520
into these outrageous contracts, and often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting

238
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,280
repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and decay

239
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
of black neighborhoods.

240
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,720
And as if that wasn't bad enough, there was also

241
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
4.

242
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Blockbusting.

243
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Blockbusting describes the practice of horrible goddamn vulture real estate agents who'd

244
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,120
promote fear of an impending minority takeover of a white neighborhood in order to basically

245
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,040
trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below market prices.

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,480
Again the villainous bastards would sell those same houses at extortionate prices to

247
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,840
black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

248
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,800
The total effects of restrictive covenants, redlining, predatory lending, and blockbusting

249
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
were catastrophic for black communities.

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Black families were largely denied the benefits of the 1930s to 60s suburban boom that enabled

251
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,320
so many white families to enjoy a middle class life.

252
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,240
Instead, black families were often trapped in neighborhoods that succumbed to ghettoization,

253
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,080
urban decay, bad schools, cyclical poverty and crime, and discriminatory policing that

254
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,560
persists to this day.

255
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,800
To get a sense for how all of this goes together, let's compare the original 1937 redlining

256
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,960
map of Baltimore to the 2013 population by race map, to this map of Baltimore police

257
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,560
stops between 2010 and 2015, that's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

258
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,960
recorded police stops of black pedestrians, and finally let's bring back the map of

259
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,000
childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hopefully the lead poisoning makes more sense now, since redlining and restrictive covenants

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,160
historically forced blacks into ghettos, where predatory contracts made homeownership on

262
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,080
affordable, leading to residential decay, including the persistence of old lead paint,

263
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,160
which poisons children, making them more likely to drop out of school and commit crimes, and

264
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,720
therefore wind up in the back of police vans like the one where Freddie Gray's spine

265
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,800
was severed, leading to his death, and the consequent uprising and unrest.

266
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,920
So when you say, there's no more legal discrimination against black people, so why don't they

267
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,080
just stop complaining about racism already, you're being a fucking idiot.

268
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,080
The effects of government backed discrimination don't go away just because the laws change.

269
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,840
The discrimination is now built into the very structure of American cities, and that's

270
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,400
a problem that's going to take a long time and a lot of work to undo, but it begins with

271
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,400
rejecting racism and simplistic, surface-level non-solutions like broken windows policing.

272
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,720
The flip side of this is that activism needs to be a lot more nuanced than fuck the police.

273
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,960
Yeah, there are bad, violent, and bigoted cops, and yeah, there are official policies

274
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,080
that enable brutality, including those that contributed to the dismissal of all charges

275
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,360
against the six cops involved in the Freddie Gray homicide case.

276
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,280
All of this should be strenuously opposed, but we also have to acknowledge that the problems

277
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,960
of racial injustice go way deeper than anything the police can be expected to fix.

278
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Part Next.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
What Do.

280
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,960
When I think about Freddie Gray's life, from the childhood lead poisoning, to the

281
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,280
exploitative purchase of his settlement, to his quite possibly groundless arrest, to the

282
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,800
fatal injury he sustained in police custody, what I see is a whole system of institutions

283
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,680
that basically treat black lives as if they don't matter.

284
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,080
If only there was some kind of activist organization dedicated to opposing that situation.

285
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Hmm.

286
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm coming up blank.

287
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,120
Now I'm not an expert in this stuff, so feel free to correct or add to my suggestions

288
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,040
in the comments, but it seems to me that what's needed most are political solutions.

289
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,800
For instance, education reform in cities with bad schools, non-discriminatory access to

290
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,880
non-predatory home loans, and, of course, police reform.

291
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Black Lives Matter affiliate Campaign Zero's website lists ten policy suggestions to address

292
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,440
the police issue that I think look pretty good.

293
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,920
Unfortunately, because of the results of the 2016 election, things are probably going

294
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,560
to get worse before they get better.

295
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,060
It's clear that this country's attitudes about race are still pretty fucking benighted.

296
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,120
People who get their information from cable news or god help us, YouTube, are generally

297
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,840
pretty ignorant about this stuff.

298
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,760
So one thing we can all do is try to engage people a little bit.

299
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,080
If you see someone saying some racist or ignorant shit, I mean, it's not like you're going

300
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,640
to convince them, but you can try to make them a little less confident in their ignorance.

301
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,960
And maybe, over time, those sorts of conversations will add up.

302
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,760
And of course, you've got to be real gentle about it, because, well, white people can

303
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,280
be pretty sensitive about this, and they will spring on you like a bear trap if they think

304
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
you're calling them racist.

305
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,400
So, tread lightly, try not to act like too much of a self-righteous college student,

306
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,480
and cultivate the patience of a monk.

307
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Or drink a lot.

308
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,920
I mean, it's really the least you can do, especially if you're white.

309
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,440
And I know a lot of white people think, well, slavery and Jim Crow are over, and I wasn't

310
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,200
even born yet, so it's not my fault, why is everyone blaming me when it's not my responsibility?

311
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,680
Man, fuck that shit.

312
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,200
As a white person, I personally feel a basic minimum duty to try and get informed about

313
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,080
this kind of thing, at the very least, because the world is bad, and it's bad in ways that

314
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,840
benefit me, so if you feel entitled to stay in your bubble and not think about anyone

315
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,040
else's problems, well, that just kind of sucks.

316
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,440
Well, thanks for watching the video.

317
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,000
If you want to help me make more semi-informative burlesques about this kind of topic, pledging

318
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,240
a couple dollars a video on Patreon goes a long way for me, but only if you want to.

319
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,440
I am very pleased to have a lot of new patrons this month, so a huge thanks goes out to Michael

320
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,520
C. Johnson, J. Michael Comfort, Nick Wolf, Garrett Lathy, Robert Phillips, Kat Stas,

322
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,440
of Souls, Vorone, NoNoNo, Bottled Sky, Raymond Heinrich, Heterodox, Roman Olushev, and all

323
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,840
the rest of you who make it possible for me to do this.

324
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Y'all are great.

325
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:58,840
I'll see you next time.
