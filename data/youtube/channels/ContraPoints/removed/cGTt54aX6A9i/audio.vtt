00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
Can't wait to sit back and drink the tears of misogynists when we elect our first woman

00:08.480 --> 00:30.000
president.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.120
Hello Jews.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.980
Things have not gone well.

00:33.980 --> 00:37.520
For the last week, all seven billion of the Earth's inhabitants have been responding

00:37.520 --> 00:43.040
to the 2016 presidential election through articles, think pieces, blog posts, Facebook

00:43.040 --> 00:48.400
rants, podcasts, Twitter threads, YouTube videos, YouTube comments, satirical comedy

00:48.400 --> 00:54.680
shows, speeches, protests, counter-protests, vandalism, violence, intimidation, bullying,

00:54.680 --> 01:00.480
crying, community organizing, conspiracy theories, meetings, Anita Sarkeesian, Klan parades,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.880
shitting, suicide, and heavy drinking.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.680
Man, so much has already been said about this fucking election that it's hard to even start

01:06.680 --> 01:07.760
making sense of it.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.440
There's a part of me that would rather just spend the next four years in a numbly ignorant

01:11.440 --> 01:13.080
bubble of drugs and white privilege.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.580
But I don't really have a job, so I have to make noises with my mouth and tell mysterious

01:16.580 --> 01:19.680
benefactors on the internet give me money, and I don't want to just make some generic

01:19.680 --> 01:22.000
liberal reacts to Trump kind of video.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.080
So this is my attempt to synthesize, in my own special way, a lot of the things other

01:26.080 --> 01:28.840
commentators have said over the past week.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Let's begin.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.640
Parte uno.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.080
What the fuck happened?

01:33.080 --> 01:35.160
Also, how fucked are we?

01:35.160 --> 01:39.560
One week out, it's clear that the first victims of Trump's election are the ethnic minorities,

01:39.560 --> 01:44.440
maligned religious groups, immigrants, women, and LGBT people who have been betrayed by

01:44.440 --> 01:48.840
an electorate that just affirmed the sovereignty of a man whose main political strategy has

01:48.840 --> 01:50.860
been to inflame resentment against them.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.360
And if you're, you know, a white man, and you find yourself already getting really angry

01:54.360 --> 01:57.760
and defensive about my implying that Trump is racist, and you think that politically

01:57.760 --> 02:01.720
correct anti-white bigots like me are the reason you're glad you voted for Trump in

02:01.720 --> 02:06.160
the first place, well, I hope you'll suspend judgment just for a little while, because

02:06.160 --> 02:08.980
that is exactly one of the things I want to talk about.

02:08.980 --> 02:13.140
And the truth is, Trump's open misogyny and appeals to racial hostility may not even be

02:13.140 --> 02:14.640
his worst attributes.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.720
For the last 18 months, he's demonstrated that his petty, cruel, capricious, vindictive,

02:19.720 --> 02:24.840
impulsive, and thesaur-y, I mean authoritarian statements and actions are not aberrations,

02:24.840 --> 02:29.020
but habitual expressions of the inner core of his personality and everything he stands

02:29.020 --> 02:30.020
for.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.880
With more constraints more conventional republicans place on Trump, the truth remains that the

02:33.880 --> 02:38.560
US military, nuclear, and surveillance apparatus will soon be managed by a man who regards

02:38.560 --> 02:43.000
science with disdain, who barges into the dressing rooms of his underage female employees,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.440
who's promised to imprison his political rivals and silence hostile journalists, who's cavalier

02:47.440 --> 02:51.360
about threatening to use torture and nuclear weapons, and who's apparently unable to repress

02:51.360 --> 02:54.120
his admiration for dictators and tyrants.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.480
Even if we take the most optimistic view of what his presidency will be like, and the

02:57.480 --> 03:00.940
most optimistic view is that he'll do none of the things he's said he'll do, there's

03:00.940 --> 03:05.280
just no escaping that this is the personality that will be talking to foreign leaders and

03:05.280 --> 03:09.820
setting the tone of national politics for as long as this new hell persists.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.740
Now I'm not saying that this is the apocalypse or that it's literally the Third Reich, but

03:13.740 --> 03:17.140
it is a catastrophe that we can only really begin to get our heads around.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.340
So the question that everyone's asking now is, how the fuck did this happen?

03:21.340 --> 03:22.740
Parte dule.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.620
How the fuck did this happen?

03:24.620 --> 03:27.680
Before we try to answer that, let's get clear about what happened.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.040
Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 700,000 votes at the time of writing, and

03:32.040 --> 03:34.640
possibly by as many as 1 or 2 million votes.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.560
So even though Hillary was a pretty unpopular candidate, she still proved more popular than

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
Trump.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.560
And voter turnout was low enough that only around a quarter of eligible voters actually

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
voted for Trump.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.760
So we don't need to explain a Trump landslide, merely a narrow victory that hinged on low

03:47.760 --> 03:51.040
turnout and the United States bizarre electoral college system.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.880
And if you're not American I'd tell you to google it, but honestly it's just one of those

03:53.880 --> 03:56.340
things that you'll never understand unless you were born here, you know?

03:56.340 --> 03:58.100
It's like our, I don't know, Marmite?

03:58.100 --> 04:01.020
Either you love it or you hate it, but pretty much we just hate it.

04:01.020 --> 04:04.340
Trump's victory took me and a lot of other people by complete surprise, because it wasn't

04:04.340 --> 04:06.020
predicted by the polls.

04:06.020 --> 04:09.740
Some people have suggested this means the polls were wrong, but that isn't necessarily

04:09.740 --> 04:10.740
true.

04:10.740 --> 04:15.940
On election day, 538 gave Trump a 28% chance of winning, and 28% is not zero.

04:15.940 --> 04:19.180
It's more than 1 in 4, the odds of two flipped coins landing on heads.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.440
And you know, sometimes you flip two coins and get two heads, and that's not a failure

04:22.440 --> 04:23.540
of statistical prediction.

04:23.540 --> 04:27.100
So the question is why did so many people vote for Trump, at least enough to give him

04:27.100 --> 04:28.260
the edge over Hillary?

04:28.260 --> 04:31.860
Well, people will probably be arguing about the answer to that question for decades.

04:31.860 --> 04:35.980
I've read maybe 100 articles on this in the past week, and I've encountered so many different

04:35.980 --> 04:40.380
explanations that I've lost my faith in the basic unity of reality and in the human ability

04:40.380 --> 04:42.140
to discover truth within it.

04:42.140 --> 04:45.620
We've got people saying Trump won because of third party candidates, because the Democrats

04:45.620 --> 04:49.700
nominated Hillary instead of Bernie Sanders, because of working class voters in the midwest,

04:49.700 --> 04:53.500
because of white racism, because of James Comey's letter about Hillary's emails, because

04:53.500 --> 04:58.480
of misogyny, because of white women, because of social media, because of low voter turnout,

04:58.480 --> 05:03.120
because Trump is a celebrity with brand recognition, because of collusion with the Ruskies, because

05:03.120 --> 05:06.720
small talk from the workers live in a bubble, because of Hillary's emails, because the DNC

05:06.720 --> 05:10.360
rigged the primary, because Obama refused to say the phrase Islamic terrorism, because

05:10.360 --> 05:14.520
politically correct liberals made white men really angry, because of Hillary's emails,

05:14.520 --> 05:18.040
because the coastal elites didn't listen to the concerns of the people, because SJW's

05:18.040 --> 05:21.260
don't trust the establishment, because Pepe the Frog carried an army of trolls instead

05:21.260 --> 05:22.260
of Hillary...

05:22.260 --> 05:23.260
Stop!

05:23.260 --> 05:26.560
We could spend the rest of our lives discussing these different theories, but I want to focus

05:26.560 --> 05:30.940
on one idea that seems to get floated in the liberal press again and again and again.

05:30.940 --> 05:34.740
That's the idea that the core of Trump's support and the reason he won the election are a group

05:34.740 --> 05:38.660
of people called the White Working Class.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.820
Part 3.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.740
The White Working Class.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.580
Who are the White Working Class?

05:44.640 --> 05:49.600
Well, most commentators seem to focus on underemployed people in rural towns where manufacturing

05:49.600 --> 05:53.680
jobs have been vanishing for decades, leaving behind a population that feels left behind

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
and hopeless.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.280
Often these articles are accompanied by pictures of bearded men drinking beer out of rusty

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
cans.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.640
The reader is then told not to malign Trump voters in these towns as racist, and that

06:02.640 --> 06:08.200
instead we should empathize with their economic anxiety.

06:08.200 --> 06:12.160
Now there's some validity to this basic idea, but these commentators sometimes make it sound

06:12.160 --> 06:16.380
like the people focusing on the racist aspect of Trump's appeal are just a bunch of smug,

06:16.380 --> 06:20.860
liberal, coastal elitist college professor academic eggheads who are just out of touch

06:20.860 --> 06:22.300
with White Working Class angst.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.660
And then you see other liberals who respond to that, saying, well what about the angst

06:25.660 --> 06:29.660
of the Black and Hispanic working classes, motherfucker, who by all measures are economically

06:29.660 --> 06:33.780
even worse off and who now have to deal with a borderline White nationalist plutocrat steering

06:33.780 --> 06:34.780
the ship.

06:34.780 --> 06:38.140
I think part of what's happening here is that an old rift within the left is becoming really

06:38.140 --> 06:39.140
pronounced.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.880
We're talking about the divide between what's called the old left, the Marx-influenced progressives

06:42.880 --> 06:47.560
who focus primarily on economic injustice in the working class, and the new left, the

06:47.560 --> 06:51.960
progressives primarily focused on what is derided as identity politics, namely race,

06:51.960 --> 06:53.240
gender, and sexuality.

06:53.240 --> 06:57.240
Now it's just obvious to me that any progressivism that doesn't include both these considerations

06:57.240 --> 06:59.560
is totally lopsided and inadequate.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.000
But bringing it all together is no easy task, and one of the reasons is that it's pretty

07:03.000 --> 07:06.480
difficult to get people to care about the struggles of other groups, especially when

07:06.480 --> 07:08.400
they're absorbed by the struggles of their own.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.260
In the right-wing media, one of the most popular explanations of Trump's victory has it that

07:12.260 --> 07:14.380
political correctness is to blame.

07:14.380 --> 07:18.420
The idea is that white men got fed up with people calling them sexist and racist, and

07:18.420 --> 07:22.340
they responded by throwing a tantrum and electing a proto-fascist as a kind of brick through

07:22.340 --> 07:26.140
the window of all the moralizing liberals who made them feel like bad people.

07:26.140 --> 07:30.340
Personally, I'm inclined to blame the tantrum rather than political correctness, but the

07:30.340 --> 07:34.060
longer I'm involved with these issues, the more I realize that a lot of people basically

07:34.060 --> 07:37.720
lose their shit if you imply that they might have some kind of bias or privilege.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.700
And it's not just middle-class white men either.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.620
I've seen black men who are very incisive on the topic of race go on to lash out at

07:43.620 --> 07:48.660
feminists and LGBT activists, I've seen feminists act like the word cis is some kind of slur

07:48.660 --> 07:52.260
against them, and we've all seen a working-class hero tell a feminist,

07:52.260 --> 07:56.580
I'm sorry princess, but I can't listen to your whining right now because I got the black lung

07:56.580 --> 08:01.860
and lost three fingers so I can make alimony payments to my horror of an ex-wife.

08:01.860 --> 08:02.860
What a fucking mess.

08:02.860 --> 08:06.840
And of course while these people are all squabbling in the gutter, a couple of rich white pricks

08:06.840 --> 08:10.720
are always riding a gold-plated elevator to the top of the tower.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
Par-te-quatro.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.420
The gold-plated elevator.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.860
One problem I have with liberal commentators' sudden obsession with white working-class

08:17.860 --> 08:21.300
voters is that it actually misrepresents the typical Trump voter.

08:21.300 --> 08:26.540
According to FiveThirtyEight, the median annual income for Trump supporters is around $70,000,

08:26.540 --> 08:28.060
higher than the national average.

08:28.060 --> 08:31.440
So so much for the pensionless Appalachian Opioid addict theory.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.120
The majority of white men with college degrees supported Trump.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.740
If support for Trump were best understood in terms of the economic anxiety of the white

08:37.740 --> 08:41.380
working-class, then we'd expect to see a big divide along class lines.

08:41.380 --> 08:45.560
And there is a bit of a class divide, but it's nowhere near the racial divide.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.420
Now I don't think it's overly Marxist to suggest that one of the problems with capitalism is

08:49.420 --> 08:52.300
that there is some risk of class conflict.

08:52.300 --> 08:56.060
Capitalism more than any other economic system creates vast amounts of wealth, but it tends

08:56.060 --> 08:59.820
to concentrate it in the hands of a small percentage of the total population.

08:59.820 --> 09:03.900
This is why savvy capitalists, capitalists who want to stabilize and preserve capitalism,

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
are liberals.

09:04.900 --> 09:09.080
They know that without regulations, a little wealth redistribution, and a reliable safety

09:09.080 --> 09:13.240
net, the people excluded from wealth will eventually revolt against the system, leading

09:13.240 --> 09:17.000
to the replacement of capitalist leadership by either socialism, if the revolution is

09:17.000 --> 09:21.240
unified by class, or fascism, if the revolution is unified by race.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.520
Now in the United States, this has traditionally been prevented from happening by a pretty

09:24.520 --> 09:29.160
robust welfare state, epitomized by FDR's New Deal and Johnson's Great Society.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.660
When the welfare state began to be dismantled by Reagan in the 1980s, capitalism was still

09:33.660 --> 09:38.440
ideologically propped up by a little thing you may have forgotten about called the American

09:38.440 --> 09:40.120
Dream.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.740
The idea was basically that anyone can be wealthy and successful, as long as they work

09:43.740 --> 09:44.740
hard enough.

09:44.740 --> 09:48.300
Now, black people have never really believed this, but for white people it's been a compelling

09:48.300 --> 09:52.480
fantasy, and a fantasy that is supplemented by political rhetoric that wards off liberal

09:52.480 --> 09:55.800
and socialist ideas with sinister racial implications.

09:55.800 --> 10:00.840
To a lot of white Americans, even in especially extremely poor ones, phrases like welfare

10:00.840 --> 10:05.820
and wealth redistribution kind of imply that money won't be taken from hardworking whites

10:05.820 --> 10:07.640
and given to lazy blacks.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.380
Years of racist propaganda have supported this idea, and in the eyes of some working

10:11.380 --> 10:15.460
class whites, it's confirmed by the fact that a lot of liberals spend more time talking

10:15.460 --> 10:19.020
about racism than about the economic hardships of the working whites.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.860
Now for the last few decades, this state of affairs has started to crack.

10:22.860 --> 10:26.500
American companies discovered they could get much cheaper labor overseas, or that factory

10:26.500 --> 10:28.060
jobs could be automated.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.240
This has led to the decline of American manufacturing jobs and a class of people who are basically

10:32.240 --> 10:35.720
permanently underemployed and feeling the economy has left them behind.

10:35.720 --> 10:40.520
Then, in the 2000s, a lot of Americans were issued subprime mortgages, which led to the

10:40.520 --> 10:45.360
housing bubble, and that, along with the deregulation of finance and several other factors, brought

10:45.360 --> 10:47.280
on the Great Recession in 2008.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.440
Plus, a whole generation has now come of age amid rapidly escalating college tuition costs

10:52.440 --> 10:54.760
and consequent shitloads of student debt.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.880
The upshot of all this is that millions of people, many of them white, are now sitting

10:58.880 --> 11:03.240
around waiting with increasing despair for manufacturing to come back, or they're graduating

11:03.240 --> 11:07.400
from college only to realize they're crippled by debt and without reliable employment.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.780
With unaffordable healthcare and little in the way of a safety net, things are looking

11:10.780 --> 11:12.120
pretty bleak.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.240
To many of these people, the American Dream is dead.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.940
They know that they're never going to be millionaires, and they're well aware that they've been deeply

11:18.940 --> 11:20.780
and perhaps permanently fucked.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.320
Ayn Rand-type ideology is no longer going to appeal to these people.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.120
The poor have to identify with the rich in order to worship them, and it's hard to identify

11:28.120 --> 11:30.740
with someone once you realize they've burned you.

11:30.740 --> 11:37.160
All of this has led to the now prevailing anti-establishment mood.

11:37.160 --> 11:41.800
And suddenly, after decades of unquestioned corporate capitalist dominance, other systems

11:41.800 --> 11:43.640
are beginning to look attractive.

11:43.640 --> 11:47.640
This I think is why Bernie Sanders was more successful than any other American socialist

11:47.640 --> 11:48.640
in decades.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.520
For a lot of young people, it seems intolerable to struggle with no end in sight under the

11:52.520 --> 11:55.960
weight of massive student debt, which their whole life system encouraged them to incur

11:55.960 --> 11:59.000
when they were teenagers who didn't know what they were getting into.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.200
Without much hope of home ownership, retirement, or other comforts their parents took for granted,

12:03.200 --> 12:07.020
a lot of millennials are burning with frustration and resentment at the financial elite that

12:07.020 --> 12:09.560
reaps most of the wealth of the global economy.

12:09.560 --> 12:13.280
Bernie Sanders became the champion of that frustration, but he failed to win the Democratic

12:13.280 --> 12:17.640
nomination, partly because he was never able to successfully appeal to black and Hispanic

12:17.640 --> 12:18.640
voters.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.120
So Clinton became the nominee, but she was unable to gain traction outside the base of

12:22.120 --> 12:23.120
the Democratic party.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.560
She was particularly bad at responding effectively to the new white disaffection, and her image

12:27.560 --> 12:32.040
as a scandal-laden career politician with corporate ties made her seem like the avatar

12:32.040 --> 12:34.720
of everything wrong with the Washington establishment.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.660
Now whenever the working and middle classes get into a deep enough funk, there's two things

12:38.660 --> 12:39.880
that usually happen.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.560
Either they go socialist and turn against the corporate goons that burned them, or they

12:43.560 --> 12:47.080
lose their fucking minds pursuing some racial minority scapegoat.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.520
So summer 2016 rolls around, and the major parties nominate their candidates.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.560
Exit Bernie Sanders, enter Donald Trump.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.480
Trump is a demagogue the likes of which American presidential politics hasn't seen in more

12:58.480 --> 12:59.760
than a century.

12:59.760 --> 13:05.260
He makes absurd promises to bring back the jobs, great jobs, the best jobs, it's gonna

13:05.260 --> 13:07.120
be terrific, it's gonna be huge.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.960
Oh, and he also coyly points the finger at blacks, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, and the

13:11.960 --> 13:16.200
politically correct culture that keeps white America from saying what it's really thinking.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.560
And once that ball starts rolling, the media can't look away.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.400
The country's comparatively few misdeeds are easy for people to stay focused on.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.340
Meanwhile, Trump advocates that we commit war crimes, claims that Mexican immigrants

13:27.340 --> 13:31.840
are rapists, brags about grabbing women by the pussy, and generally behaves so badly

13:31.840 --> 13:36.880
so frequently that the media can't even really make time to digest any given scandal.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.600
And in fact, people who are sick of having to keep their ugly prejudices to themselves

13:40.600 --> 13:43.200
feel liberated by Trump's disdain for common decency.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.640
If there's any truth to the tantrum against political correctionists hypothesis, it might

13:47.640 --> 13:52.000
even be the case that some people supported Trump because of his open contempt for women

13:52.000 --> 13:54.280
and popularity with racist hate groups.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.560
Now I know that some people had other reasons for supporting Trump, you know, they believe

13:57.560 --> 14:01.600
he'll shake things up or something, but you still chose to vote for him knowing full well

14:01.600 --> 14:05.960
the kind of rhetoric he was using, and I think you have to take responsibility for that.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.760
Whatever the reason, one in four eligible voters cast their ballot for him, and that

14:09.760 --> 14:11.500
was enough to get him to the White House.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.640
So the question now is what to do with Mr. Trump.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.400
Parte Cinque.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.520
What to do with Mr. Trump.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.100
Well that's a question we're going to have to keep answering for the next four years.

14:23.100 --> 14:28.120
For the time being, I strongly support nonviolent protests and demonstrations against Trump.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.040
It's important that we let all the people who Trump has disparaged and blamed and abused

14:32.040 --> 14:35.640
know that we have their backs, and that we're willing to put up an act of resistance to

14:35.640 --> 14:37.540
Trump and everything he represents.

14:37.540 --> 14:41.280
The Democrats are a minority in both the House and Senate, but they could pursue the same

14:41.280 --> 14:45.340
obstructionism that Republicans have used against Obama for the last eight years.

14:45.340 --> 14:48.820
Of course, this will continue the degradation and sabotage of the legislative branch that

14:48.820 --> 14:53.460
the Republicans began, but it might be worth it to prevent, for instance, the repeal of

14:53.460 --> 14:54.460
Obamacare.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.020
For the most part, we have to place our hope in the 2018 and 2020 elections.

14:58.020 --> 15:01.380
Merely waiting for time to pass will help, since Trump is not going to be able to make

15:01.380 --> 15:02.980
good on his promises.

15:02.980 --> 15:06.940
Well-paying manufacturing jobs are not going to come back, Muslims and immigrants are not

15:06.940 --> 15:11.300
going away, and I dare him to try to build that fucking wall.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.460
Public opinion can change very quickly.

15:13.460 --> 15:18.640
Nixon went by a landslide in 1972, and then resigned in disgrace a few years later.

15:18.640 --> 15:23.060
Trump is highly prone to scandals, he's going to fuck things up, and now that he is the

15:23.060 --> 15:27.040
political establishment, people will blame him for everything that goes wrong, and his

15:27.040 --> 15:30.020
stupid antics will lose their insurrectional charm.

15:30.020 --> 15:33.220
I also have a couple suggestions for things not to do.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.020
Number one, don't riot.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.020
I enjoy smashing and burning shit as much as the next guy, but it helps nothing, and

15:39.020 --> 15:43.460
it will be used as an excuse for more brutal policing and incarceration, along with all

15:43.460 --> 15:46.100
the racial disparities that that entails.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.620
Number two, do not kill yourself.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.140
There's no time for that now.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.660
There are people who need your help.

15:51.660 --> 15:56.380
Now, losing an election to a villainous prick can be genuinely traumatic, I understand,

15:56.380 --> 16:00.340
especially if you belong to a group that feels suddenly unwelcome in this country.

16:00.340 --> 16:04.100
Hunter S. Thompson described the scene in Washington after the progressive McGovern

16:04.100 --> 16:08.180
lost to Nixon in 72 as complete weeping chaos.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.580
People you'd never expect to break down stumbled off the plane in tears, and it was like a

16:11.580 --> 16:13.940
funeral after a mass murder or something.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.980
I lost my composure too, I admit.

16:15.980 --> 16:19.340
I drank myself into a stupor and tweeted some dumb things.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.860
But it's time to regroup.

16:20.860 --> 16:24.660
In times of grave defeat, I like to remember the words of a little man you may have forgotten

16:24.660 --> 16:29.180
about called Satan, who, awaking in the pit of hell after being cast from heaven, enjoined

16:29.180 --> 16:35.060
his comrades to consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy.

16:35.060 --> 16:42.340
Our own loss, our repair, how overcome this dire calamity, what reinforcement we may gain

16:42.340 --> 16:49.340
from hope, if not, what resolution from despair.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.300
Well, down with Trump.

16:53.300 --> 16:59.180
Hail Satan.

16:59.180 --> 17:05.020
