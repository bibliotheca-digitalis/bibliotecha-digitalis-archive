1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Can't wait to sit back and drink the tears of misogynists when we elect our first woman

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:30,000
president.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,120
Hello Jews.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,980
Things have not gone well.

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,520
For the last week, all seven billion of the Earth's inhabitants have been responding

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,040
to the 2016 presidential election through articles, think pieces, blog posts, Facebook

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,400
rants, podcasts, Twitter threads, YouTube videos, YouTube comments, satirical comedy

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,680
shows, speeches, protests, counter-protests, vandalism, violence, intimidation, bullying,

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,480
crying, community organizing, conspiracy theories, meetings, Anita Sarkeesian, Klan parades,

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
shitting, suicide, and heavy drinking.

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,680
Man, so much has already been said about this fucking election that it's hard to even start

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,760
making sense of it.

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,440
There's a part of me that would rather just spend the next four years in a numbly ignorant

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,080
bubble of drugs and white privilege.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,580
But I don't really have a job, so I have to make noises with my mouth and tell mysterious

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,680
benefactors on the internet give me money, and I don't want to just make some generic

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
liberal reacts to Trump kind of video.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
So this is my attempt to synthesize, in my own special way, a lot of the things other

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,840
commentators have said over the past week.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Let's begin.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Parte uno.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,080
What the fuck happened?

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,160
Also, how fucked are we?

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,560
One week out, it's clear that the first victims of Trump's election are the ethnic minorities,

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,440
maligned religious groups, immigrants, women, and LGBT people who have been betrayed by

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,840
an electorate that just affirmed the sovereignty of a man whose main political strategy has

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,860
been to inflame resentment against them.

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,360
And if you're, you know, a white man, and you find yourself already getting really angry

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,760
and defensive about my implying that Trump is racist, and you think that politically

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,720
correct anti-white bigots like me are the reason you're glad you voted for Trump in

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,160
the first place, well, I hope you'll suspend judgment just for a little while, because

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,980
that is exactly one of the things I want to talk about.

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,140
And the truth is, Trump's open misogyny and appeals to racial hostility may not even be

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,640
his worst attributes.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,720
For the last 18 months, he's demonstrated that his petty, cruel, capricious, vindictive,

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,840
impulsive, and thesaur-y, I mean authoritarian statements and actions are not aberrations,

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,020
but habitual expressions of the inner core of his personality and everything he stands

38
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
for.

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,880
With more constraints more conventional republicans place on Trump, the truth remains that the

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,560
US military, nuclear, and surveillance apparatus will soon be managed by a man who regards

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,000
science with disdain, who barges into the dressing rooms of his underage female employees,

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,440
who's promised to imprison his political rivals and silence hostile journalists, who's cavalier

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
about threatening to use torture and nuclear weapons, and who's apparently unable to repress

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,120
his admiration for dictators and tyrants.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,480
Even if we take the most optimistic view of what his presidency will be like, and the

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,940
most optimistic view is that he'll do none of the things he's said he'll do, there's

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,280
just no escaping that this is the personality that will be talking to foreign leaders and

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,820
setting the tone of national politics for as long as this new hell persists.

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,740
Now I'm not saying that this is the apocalypse or that it's literally the Third Reich, but

50
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,140
it is a catastrophe that we can only really begin to get our heads around.

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,340
So the question that everyone's asking now is, how the fuck did this happen?

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,740
Parte dule.

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,620
How the fuck did this happen?

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,680
Before we try to answer that, let's get clear about what happened.

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,040
Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 700,000 votes at the time of writing, and

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,640
possibly by as many as 1 or 2 million votes.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
So even though Hillary was a pretty unpopular candidate, she still proved more popular than

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Trump.

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
And voter turnout was low enough that only around a quarter of eligible voters actually

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
voted for Trump.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,760
So we don't need to explain a Trump landslide, merely a narrow victory that hinged on low

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
turnout and the United States bizarre electoral college system.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,880
And if you're not American I'd tell you to google it, but honestly it's just one of those

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,340
things that you'll never understand unless you were born here, you know?

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,100
It's like our, I don't know, Marmite?

66
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,020
Either you love it or you hate it, but pretty much we just hate it.

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,340
Trump's victory took me and a lot of other people by complete surprise, because it wasn't

68
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,020
predicted by the polls.

69
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,740
Some people have suggested this means the polls were wrong, but that isn't necessarily

70
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
true.

71
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,940
On election day, 538 gave Trump a 28% chance of winning, and 28% is not zero.

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,180
It's more than 1 in 4, the odds of two flipped coins landing on heads.

73
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,440
And you know, sometimes you flip two coins and get two heads, and that's not a failure

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,540
of statistical prediction.

75
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,100
So the question is why did so many people vote for Trump, at least enough to give him

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,260
the edge over Hillary?

77
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,860
Well, people will probably be arguing about the answer to that question for decades.

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,980
I've read maybe 100 articles on this in the past week, and I've encountered so many different

79
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,380
explanations that I've lost my faith in the basic unity of reality and in the human ability

80
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,140
to discover truth within it.

81
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,620
We've got people saying Trump won because of third party candidates, because the Democrats

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,700
nominated Hillary instead of Bernie Sanders, because of working class voters in the midwest,

83
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,500
because of white racism, because of James Comey's letter about Hillary's emails, because

84
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,480
of misogyny, because of white women, because of social media, because of low voter turnout,

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,120
because Trump is a celebrity with brand recognition, because of collusion with the Ruskies, because

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
small talk from the workers live in a bubble, because of Hillary's emails, because the DNC

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,360
rigged the primary, because Obama refused to say the phrase Islamic terrorism, because

88
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,520
politically correct liberals made white men really angry, because of Hillary's emails,

89
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,040
because the coastal elites didn't listen to the concerns of the people, because SJW's

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,260
don't trust the establishment, because Pepe the Frog carried an army of trolls instead

91
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
of Hillary...

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Stop!

93
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,560
We could spend the rest of our lives discussing these different theories, but I want to focus

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,940
on one idea that seems to get floated in the liberal press again and again and again.

95
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,740
That's the idea that the core of Trump's support and the reason he won the election are a group

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,660
of people called the White Working Class.

97
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,820
Part 3.

98
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,740
The White Working Class.

99
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,580
Who are the White Working Class?

100
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,600
Well, most commentators seem to focus on underemployed people in rural towns where manufacturing

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
jobs have been vanishing for decades, leaving behind a population that feels left behind

102
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
and hopeless.

103
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,280
Often these articles are accompanied by pictures of bearded men drinking beer out of rusty

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
cans.

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,640
The reader is then told not to malign Trump voters in these towns as racist, and that

106
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,200
instead we should empathize with their economic anxiety.

107
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,160
Now there's some validity to this basic idea, but these commentators sometimes make it sound

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,380
like the people focusing on the racist aspect of Trump's appeal are just a bunch of smug,

109
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,860
liberal, coastal elitist college professor academic eggheads who are just out of touch

110
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,300
with White Working Class angst.

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,660
And then you see other liberals who respond to that, saying, well what about the angst

112
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,660
of the Black and Hispanic working classes, motherfucker, who by all measures are economically

113
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,780
even worse off and who now have to deal with a borderline White nationalist plutocrat steering

114
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
the ship.

115
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,140
I think part of what's happening here is that an old rift within the left is becoming really

116
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
pronounced.

117
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,880
We're talking about the divide between what's called the old left, the Marx-influenced progressives

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,560
who focus primarily on economic injustice in the working class, and the new left, the

119
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,960
progressives primarily focused on what is derided as identity politics, namely race,

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,240
gender, and sexuality.

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Now it's just obvious to me that any progressivism that doesn't include both these considerations

122
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,560
is totally lopsided and inadequate.

123
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,000
But bringing it all together is no easy task, and one of the reasons is that it's pretty

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,480
difficult to get people to care about the struggles of other groups, especially when

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
they're absorbed by the struggles of their own.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,260
In the right-wing media, one of the most popular explanations of Trump's victory has it that

127
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,380
political correctness is to blame.

128
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,420
The idea is that white men got fed up with people calling them sexist and racist, and

129
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,340
they responded by throwing a tantrum and electing a proto-fascist as a kind of brick through

130
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,140
the window of all the moralizing liberals who made them feel like bad people.

131
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,340
Personally, I'm inclined to blame the tantrum rather than political correctness, but the

132
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,060
longer I'm involved with these issues, the more I realize that a lot of people basically

133
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,720
lose their shit if you imply that they might have some kind of bias or privilege.

134
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,700
And it's not just middle-class white men either.

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,620
I've seen black men who are very incisive on the topic of race go on to lash out at

136
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,660
feminists and LGBT activists, I've seen feminists act like the word cis is some kind of slur

137
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,260
against them, and we've all seen a working-class hero tell a feminist,

138
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,580
I'm sorry princess, but I can't listen to your whining right now because I got the black lung

139
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,860
and lost three fingers so I can make alimony payments to my horror of an ex-wife.

140
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
What a fucking mess.

141
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,840
And of course while these people are all squabbling in the gutter, a couple of rich white pricks

142
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,720
are always riding a gold-plated elevator to the top of the tower.

143
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Par-te-quatro.

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,420
The gold-plated elevator.

145
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,860
One problem I have with liberal commentators' sudden obsession with white working-class

146
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,300
voters is that it actually misrepresents the typical Trump voter.

147
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,540
According to FiveThirtyEight, the median annual income for Trump supporters is around $70,000,

148
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,060
higher than the national average.

149
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,440
So so much for the pensionless Appalachian Opioid addict theory.

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,120
The majority of white men with college degrees supported Trump.

151
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,740
If support for Trump were best understood in terms of the economic anxiety of the white

152
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,380
working-class, then we'd expect to see a big divide along class lines.

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,560
And there is a bit of a class divide, but it's nowhere near the racial divide.

154
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,420
Now I don't think it's overly Marxist to suggest that one of the problems with capitalism is

155
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,300
that there is some risk of class conflict.

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,060
Capitalism more than any other economic system creates vast amounts of wealth, but it tends

157
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,820
to concentrate it in the hands of a small percentage of the total population.

158
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,900
This is why savvy capitalists, capitalists who want to stabilize and preserve capitalism,

159
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
are liberals.

160
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,080
They know that without regulations, a little wealth redistribution, and a reliable safety

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,240
net, the people excluded from wealth will eventually revolt against the system, leading

162
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,000
to the replacement of capitalist leadership by either socialism, if the revolution is

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,240
unified by class, or fascism, if the revolution is unified by race.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,520
Now in the United States, this has traditionally been prevented from happening by a pretty

165
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,160
robust welfare state, epitomized by FDR's New Deal and Johnson's Great Society.

166
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,660
When the welfare state began to be dismantled by Reagan in the 1980s, capitalism was still

167
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,440
ideologically propped up by a little thing you may have forgotten about called the American

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Dream.

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,740
The idea was basically that anyone can be wealthy and successful, as long as they work

170
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
hard enough.

171
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,300
Now, black people have never really believed this, but for white people it's been a compelling

172
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,480
fantasy, and a fantasy that is supplemented by political rhetoric that wards off liberal

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,800
and socialist ideas with sinister racial implications.

174
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,840
To a lot of white Americans, even in especially extremely poor ones, phrases like welfare

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,820
and wealth redistribution kind of imply that money won't be taken from hardworking whites

176
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,640
and given to lazy blacks.

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,380
Years of racist propaganda have supported this idea, and in the eyes of some working

178
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,460
class whites, it's confirmed by the fact that a lot of liberals spend more time talking

179
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,020
about racism than about the economic hardships of the working whites.

180
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,860
Now for the last few decades, this state of affairs has started to crack.

181
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,500
American companies discovered they could get much cheaper labor overseas, or that factory

182
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,060
jobs could be automated.

183
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,240
This has led to the decline of American manufacturing jobs and a class of people who are basically

184
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,720
permanently underemployed and feeling the economy has left them behind.

185
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,520
Then, in the 2000s, a lot of Americans were issued subprime mortgages, which led to the

186
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,360
housing bubble, and that, along with the deregulation of finance and several other factors, brought

187
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,280
on the Great Recession in 2008.

188
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,440
Plus, a whole generation has now come of age amid rapidly escalating college tuition costs

189
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,760
and consequent shitloads of student debt.

190
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,880
The upshot of all this is that millions of people, many of them white, are now sitting

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,240
around waiting with increasing despair for manufacturing to come back, or they're graduating

192
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,400
from college only to realize they're crippled by debt and without reliable employment.

193
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,780
With unaffordable healthcare and little in the way of a safety net, things are looking

194
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,120
pretty bleak.

195
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,240
To many of these people, the American Dream is dead.

196
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,940
They know that they're never going to be millionaires, and they're well aware that they've been deeply

197
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,780
and perhaps permanently fucked.

198
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,320
Ayn Rand-type ideology is no longer going to appeal to these people.

199
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,120
The poor have to identify with the rich in order to worship them, and it's hard to identify

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,740
with someone once you realize they've burned you.

201
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,160
All of this has led to the now prevailing anti-establishment mood.

202
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,800
And suddenly, after decades of unquestioned corporate capitalist dominance, other systems

203
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,640
are beginning to look attractive.

204
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,640
This I think is why Bernie Sanders was more successful than any other American socialist

205
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
in decades.

206
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,520
For a lot of young people, it seems intolerable to struggle with no end in sight under the

207
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,960
weight of massive student debt, which their whole life system encouraged them to incur

208
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,000
when they were teenagers who didn't know what they were getting into.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Without much hope of home ownership, retirement, or other comforts their parents took for granted,

210
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,020
a lot of millennials are burning with frustration and resentment at the financial elite that

211
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,560
reaps most of the wealth of the global economy.

212
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,280
Bernie Sanders became the champion of that frustration, but he failed to win the Democratic

213
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,640
nomination, partly because he was never able to successfully appeal to black and Hispanic

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
voters.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,120
So Clinton became the nominee, but she was unable to gain traction outside the base of

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
the Democratic party.

217
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,560
She was particularly bad at responding effectively to the new white disaffection, and her image

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,040
as a scandal-laden career politician with corporate ties made her seem like the avatar

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,720
of everything wrong with the Washington establishment.

220
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,660
Now whenever the working and middle classes get into a deep enough funk, there's two things

221
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,880
that usually happen.

222
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,560
Either they go socialist and turn against the corporate goons that burned them, or they

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,080
lose their fucking minds pursuing some racial minority scapegoat.

224
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,520
So summer 2016 rolls around, and the major parties nominate their candidates.

225
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,560
Exit Bernie Sanders, enter Donald Trump.

226
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,480
Trump is a demagogue the likes of which American presidential politics hasn't seen in more

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
than a century.

228
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,260
He makes absurd promises to bring back the jobs, great jobs, the best jobs, it's gonna

229
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,120
be terrific, it's gonna be huge.

230
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Oh, and he also coyly points the finger at blacks, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, and the

231
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,200
politically correct culture that keeps white America from saying what it's really thinking.

232
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,560
And once that ball starts rolling, the media can't look away.

233
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,400
The country's comparatively few misdeeds are easy for people to stay focused on.

234
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,340
Meanwhile, Trump advocates that we commit war crimes, claims that Mexican immigrants

235
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,840
are rapists, brags about grabbing women by the pussy, and generally behaves so badly

236
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,880
so frequently that the media can't even really make time to digest any given scandal.

237
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,600
And in fact, people who are sick of having to keep their ugly prejudices to themselves

238
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,200
feel liberated by Trump's disdain for common decency.

239
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,640
If there's any truth to the tantrum against political correctionists hypothesis, it might

240
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,000
even be the case that some people supported Trump because of his open contempt for women

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,280
and popularity with racist hate groups.

242
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,560
Now I know that some people had other reasons for supporting Trump, you know, they believe

243
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,600
he'll shake things up or something, but you still chose to vote for him knowing full well

244
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,960
the kind of rhetoric he was using, and I think you have to take responsibility for that.

245
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Whatever the reason, one in four eligible voters cast their ballot for him, and that

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,500
was enough to get him to the White House.

247
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,640
So the question now is what to do with Mr. Trump.

248
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,400
Parte Cinque.

249
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,520
What to do with Mr. Trump.

250
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,100
Well that's a question we're going to have to keep answering for the next four years.

251
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,120
For the time being, I strongly support nonviolent protests and demonstrations against Trump.

252
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,040
It's important that we let all the people who Trump has disparaged and blamed and abused

253
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,640
know that we have their backs, and that we're willing to put up an act of resistance to

254
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,540
Trump and everything he represents.

255
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,280
The Democrats are a minority in both the House and Senate, but they could pursue the same

256
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,340
obstructionism that Republicans have used against Obama for the last eight years.

257
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Of course, this will continue the degradation and sabotage of the legislative branch that

258
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,460
the Republicans began, but it might be worth it to prevent, for instance, the repeal of

259
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
Obamacare.

260
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,020
For the most part, we have to place our hope in the 2018 and 2020 elections.

261
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,380
Merely waiting for time to pass will help, since Trump is not going to be able to make

262
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,980
good on his promises.

263
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,940
Well-paying manufacturing jobs are not going to come back, Muslims and immigrants are not

264
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,300
going away, and I dare him to try to build that fucking wall.

265
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,460
Public opinion can change very quickly.

266
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,640
Nixon went by a landslide in 1972, and then resigned in disgrace a few years later.

267
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,060
Trump is highly prone to scandals, he's going to fuck things up, and now that he is the

268
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,040
political establishment, people will blame him for everything that goes wrong, and his

269
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,020
stupid antics will lose their insurrectional charm.

270
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,220
I also have a couple suggestions for things not to do.

271
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,020
Number one, don't riot.

272
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,020
I enjoy smashing and burning shit as much as the next guy, but it helps nothing, and

273
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,460
it will be used as an excuse for more brutal policing and incarceration, along with all

274
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,100
the racial disparities that that entails.

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,620
Number two, do not kill yourself.

276
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,140
There's no time for that now.

277
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,660
There are people who need your help.

278
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,380
Now, losing an election to a villainous prick can be genuinely traumatic, I understand,

279
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,340
especially if you belong to a group that feels suddenly unwelcome in this country.

280
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,100
Hunter S. Thompson described the scene in Washington after the progressive McGovern

281
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,180
lost to Nixon in 72 as complete weeping chaos.

282
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,580
People you'd never expect to break down stumbled off the plane in tears, and it was like a

283
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,940
funeral after a mass murder or something.

284
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,980
I lost my composure too, I admit.

285
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,340
I drank myself into a stupor and tweeted some dumb things.

286
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,860
But it's time to regroup.

287
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,660
In times of grave defeat, I like to remember the words of a little man you may have forgotten

288
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,180
about called Satan, who, awaking in the pit of hell after being cast from heaven, enjoined

289
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,060
his comrades to consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy.

290
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:42,340
Our own loss, our repair, how overcome this dire calamity, what reinforcement we may gain

291
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:49,340
from hope, if not, what resolution from despair.

292
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,300
Well, down with Trump.

293
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,180
Hail Satan.
