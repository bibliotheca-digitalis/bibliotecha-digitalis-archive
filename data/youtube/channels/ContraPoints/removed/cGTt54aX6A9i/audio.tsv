0	8480	Can't wait to sit back and drink the tears of misogynists when we elect our first woman
8480	30000	president.
30000	32120	Hello Jews.
32120	33980	Things have not gone well.
33980	37520	For the last week, all seven billion of the Earth's inhabitants have been responding
37520	43040	to the 2016 presidential election through articles, think pieces, blog posts, Facebook
43040	48400	rants, podcasts, Twitter threads, YouTube videos, YouTube comments, satirical comedy
48400	54680	shows, speeches, protests, counter-protests, vandalism, violence, intimidation, bullying,
54680	60480	crying, community organizing, conspiracy theories, meetings, Anita Sarkeesian, Klan parades,
60480	62880	shitting, suicide, and heavy drinking.
62880	66680	Man, so much has already been said about this fucking election that it's hard to even start
66680	67760	making sense of it.
67760	71440	There's a part of me that would rather just spend the next four years in a numbly ignorant
71440	73080	bubble of drugs and white privilege.
73080	76580	But I don't really have a job, so I have to make noises with my mouth and tell mysterious
76580	79680	benefactors on the internet give me money, and I don't want to just make some generic
79680	82000	liberal reacts to Trump kind of video.
82000	86080	So this is my attempt to synthesize, in my own special way, a lot of the things other
86080	88840	commentators have said over the past week.
88840	89840	Let's begin.
89840	91640	Parte uno.
91640	93080	What the fuck happened?
93080	95160	Also, how fucked are we?
95160	99560	One week out, it's clear that the first victims of Trump's election are the ethnic minorities,
99560	104440	maligned religious groups, immigrants, women, and LGBT people who have been betrayed by
104440	108840	an electorate that just affirmed the sovereignty of a man whose main political strategy has
108840	110860	been to inflame resentment against them.
110860	114360	And if you're, you know, a white man, and you find yourself already getting really angry
114360	117760	and defensive about my implying that Trump is racist, and you think that politically
117760	121720	correct anti-white bigots like me are the reason you're glad you voted for Trump in
121720	126160	the first place, well, I hope you'll suspend judgment just for a little while, because
126160	128980	that is exactly one of the things I want to talk about.
128980	133140	And the truth is, Trump's open misogyny and appeals to racial hostility may not even be
133140	134640	his worst attributes.
134640	139720	For the last 18 months, he's demonstrated that his petty, cruel, capricious, vindictive,
139720	144840	impulsive, and thesaur-y, I mean authoritarian statements and actions are not aberrations,
144840	149020	but habitual expressions of the inner core of his personality and everything he stands
149020	150020	for.
150020	153880	With more constraints more conventional republicans place on Trump, the truth remains that the
153880	158560	US military, nuclear, and surveillance apparatus will soon be managed by a man who regards
158560	163000	science with disdain, who barges into the dressing rooms of his underage female employees,
163000	167440	who's promised to imprison his political rivals and silence hostile journalists, who's cavalier
167440	171360	about threatening to use torture and nuclear weapons, and who's apparently unable to repress
171360	174120	his admiration for dictators and tyrants.
174120	177480	Even if we take the most optimistic view of what his presidency will be like, and the
177480	180940	most optimistic view is that he'll do none of the things he's said he'll do, there's
180940	185280	just no escaping that this is the personality that will be talking to foreign leaders and
185280	189820	setting the tone of national politics for as long as this new hell persists.
189820	193740	Now I'm not saying that this is the apocalypse or that it's literally the Third Reich, but
193740	197140	it is a catastrophe that we can only really begin to get our heads around.
197140	201340	So the question that everyone's asking now is, how the fuck did this happen?
201340	202740	Parte dule.
202740	204620	How the fuck did this happen?
204620	207680	Before we try to answer that, let's get clear about what happened.
207680	212040	Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 700,000 votes at the time of writing, and
212040	214640	possibly by as many as 1 or 2 million votes.
214640	218560	So even though Hillary was a pretty unpopular candidate, she still proved more popular than
218560	219560	Trump.
219560	222560	And voter turnout was low enough that only around a quarter of eligible voters actually
222560	223560	voted for Trump.
223560	227760	So we don't need to explain a Trump landslide, merely a narrow victory that hinged on low
227760	231040	turnout and the United States bizarre electoral college system.
231040	233880	And if you're not American I'd tell you to google it, but honestly it's just one of those
233880	236340	things that you'll never understand unless you were born here, you know?
236340	238100	It's like our, I don't know, Marmite?
238100	241020	Either you love it or you hate it, but pretty much we just hate it.
241020	244340	Trump's victory took me and a lot of other people by complete surprise, because it wasn't
244340	246020	predicted by the polls.
246020	249740	Some people have suggested this means the polls were wrong, but that isn't necessarily
249740	250740	true.
250740	255940	On election day, 538 gave Trump a 28% chance of winning, and 28% is not zero.
255940	259180	It's more than 1 in 4, the odds of two flipped coins landing on heads.
259180	262440	And you know, sometimes you flip two coins and get two heads, and that's not a failure
262440	263540	of statistical prediction.
263540	267100	So the question is why did so many people vote for Trump, at least enough to give him
267100	268260	the edge over Hillary?
268260	271860	Well, people will probably be arguing about the answer to that question for decades.
271860	275980	I've read maybe 100 articles on this in the past week, and I've encountered so many different
275980	280380	explanations that I've lost my faith in the basic unity of reality and in the human ability
280380	282140	to discover truth within it.
282140	285620	We've got people saying Trump won because of third party candidates, because the Democrats
285620	289700	nominated Hillary instead of Bernie Sanders, because of working class voters in the midwest,
289700	293500	because of white racism, because of James Comey's letter about Hillary's emails, because
293500	298480	of misogyny, because of white women, because of social media, because of low voter turnout,
298480	303120	because Trump is a celebrity with brand recognition, because of collusion with the Ruskies, because
303120	306720	small talk from the workers live in a bubble, because of Hillary's emails, because the DNC
306720	310360	rigged the primary, because Obama refused to say the phrase Islamic terrorism, because
310360	314520	politically correct liberals made white men really angry, because of Hillary's emails,
314520	318040	because the coastal elites didn't listen to the concerns of the people, because SJW's
318040	321260	don't trust the establishment, because Pepe the Frog carried an army of trolls instead
321260	322260	of Hillary...
322260	323260	Stop!
323260	326560	We could spend the rest of our lives discussing these different theories, but I want to focus
326560	330940	on one idea that seems to get floated in the liberal press again and again and again.
330940	334740	That's the idea that the core of Trump's support and the reason he won the election are a group
334740	338660	of people called the White Working Class.
338660	340820	Part 3.
340820	342740	The White Working Class.
342740	344580	Who are the White Working Class?
344640	349600	Well, most commentators seem to focus on underemployed people in rural towns where manufacturing
349600	353680	jobs have been vanishing for decades, leaving behind a population that feels left behind
353680	354680	and hopeless.
354680	358280	Often these articles are accompanied by pictures of bearded men drinking beer out of rusty
358280	359280	cans.
359280	362640	The reader is then told not to malign Trump voters in these towns as racist, and that
362640	368200	instead we should empathize with their economic anxiety.
368200	372160	Now there's some validity to this basic idea, but these commentators sometimes make it sound
372160	376380	like the people focusing on the racist aspect of Trump's appeal are just a bunch of smug,
376380	380860	liberal, coastal elitist college professor academic eggheads who are just out of touch
380860	382300	with White Working Class angst.
382300	385660	And then you see other liberals who respond to that, saying, well what about the angst
385660	389660	of the Black and Hispanic working classes, motherfucker, who by all measures are economically
389660	393780	even worse off and who now have to deal with a borderline White nationalist plutocrat steering
393780	394780	the ship.
394780	398140	I think part of what's happening here is that an old rift within the left is becoming really
398140	399140	pronounced.
399140	402880	We're talking about the divide between what's called the old left, the Marx-influenced progressives
402880	407560	who focus primarily on economic injustice in the working class, and the new left, the
407560	411960	progressives primarily focused on what is derided as identity politics, namely race,
411960	413240	gender, and sexuality.
413240	417240	Now it's just obvious to me that any progressivism that doesn't include both these considerations
417240	419560	is totally lopsided and inadequate.
419560	423000	But bringing it all together is no easy task, and one of the reasons is that it's pretty
423000	426480	difficult to get people to care about the struggles of other groups, especially when
426480	428400	they're absorbed by the struggles of their own.
428400	432260	In the right-wing media, one of the most popular explanations of Trump's victory has it that
432260	434380	political correctness is to blame.
434380	438420	The idea is that white men got fed up with people calling them sexist and racist, and
438420	442340	they responded by throwing a tantrum and electing a proto-fascist as a kind of brick through
442340	446140	the window of all the moralizing liberals who made them feel like bad people.
446140	450340	Personally, I'm inclined to blame the tantrum rather than political correctness, but the
450340	454060	longer I'm involved with these issues, the more I realize that a lot of people basically
454060	457720	lose their shit if you imply that they might have some kind of bias or privilege.
457720	459700	And it's not just middle-class white men either.
459700	463620	I've seen black men who are very incisive on the topic of race go on to lash out at
463620	468660	feminists and LGBT activists, I've seen feminists act like the word cis is some kind of slur
468660	472260	against them, and we've all seen a working-class hero tell a feminist,
472260	476580	I'm sorry princess, but I can't listen to your whining right now because I got the black lung
476580	481860	and lost three fingers so I can make alimony payments to my horror of an ex-wife.
481860	482860	What a fucking mess.
482860	486840	And of course while these people are all squabbling in the gutter, a couple of rich white pricks
486840	490720	are always riding a gold-plated elevator to the top of the tower.
490720	492720	Par-te-quatro.
492720	494420	The gold-plated elevator.
494420	497860	One problem I have with liberal commentators' sudden obsession with white working-class
497860	501300	voters is that it actually misrepresents the typical Trump voter.
501300	506540	According to FiveThirtyEight, the median annual income for Trump supporters is around $70,000,
506540	508060	higher than the national average.
508060	511440	So so much for the pensionless Appalachian Opioid addict theory.
511440	514120	The majority of white men with college degrees supported Trump.
514120	517740	If support for Trump were best understood in terms of the economic anxiety of the white
517740	521380	working-class, then we'd expect to see a big divide along class lines.
521380	525560	And there is a bit of a class divide, but it's nowhere near the racial divide.
525560	529420	Now I don't think it's overly Marxist to suggest that one of the problems with capitalism is
529420	532300	that there is some risk of class conflict.
532300	536060	Capitalism more than any other economic system creates vast amounts of wealth, but it tends
536060	539820	to concentrate it in the hands of a small percentage of the total population.
539820	543900	This is why savvy capitalists, capitalists who want to stabilize and preserve capitalism,
543900	544900	are liberals.
544900	549080	They know that without regulations, a little wealth redistribution, and a reliable safety
549080	553240	net, the people excluded from wealth will eventually revolt against the system, leading
553240	557000	to the replacement of capitalist leadership by either socialism, if the revolution is
557000	561240	unified by class, or fascism, if the revolution is unified by race.
561240	564520	Now in the United States, this has traditionally been prevented from happening by a pretty
564520	569160	robust welfare state, epitomized by FDR's New Deal and Johnson's Great Society.
569160	573660	When the welfare state began to be dismantled by Reagan in the 1980s, capitalism was still
573660	578440	ideologically propped up by a little thing you may have forgotten about called the American
578440	580120	Dream.
580120	583740	The idea was basically that anyone can be wealthy and successful, as long as they work
583740	584740	hard enough.
584740	588300	Now, black people have never really believed this, but for white people it's been a compelling
588300	592480	fantasy, and a fantasy that is supplemented by political rhetoric that wards off liberal
592480	595800	and socialist ideas with sinister racial implications.
595800	600840	To a lot of white Americans, even in especially extremely poor ones, phrases like welfare
600840	605820	and wealth redistribution kind of imply that money won't be taken from hardworking whites
605820	607640	and given to lazy blacks.
607640	611380	Years of racist propaganda have supported this idea, and in the eyes of some working
611380	615460	class whites, it's confirmed by the fact that a lot of liberals spend more time talking
615460	619020	about racism than about the economic hardships of the working whites.
619020	622860	Now for the last few decades, this state of affairs has started to crack.
622860	626500	American companies discovered they could get much cheaper labor overseas, or that factory
626500	628060	jobs could be automated.
628060	632240	This has led to the decline of American manufacturing jobs and a class of people who are basically
632240	635720	permanently underemployed and feeling the economy has left them behind.
635720	640520	Then, in the 2000s, a lot of Americans were issued subprime mortgages, which led to the
640520	645360	housing bubble, and that, along with the deregulation of finance and several other factors, brought
645360	647280	on the Great Recession in 2008.
647280	652440	Plus, a whole generation has now come of age amid rapidly escalating college tuition costs
652440	654760	and consequent shitloads of student debt.
654760	658880	The upshot of all this is that millions of people, many of them white, are now sitting
658880	663240	around waiting with increasing despair for manufacturing to come back, or they're graduating
663240	667400	from college only to realize they're crippled by debt and without reliable employment.
667400	670780	With unaffordable healthcare and little in the way of a safety net, things are looking
670780	672120	pretty bleak.
672120	675240	To many of these people, the American Dream is dead.
675240	678940	They know that they're never going to be millionaires, and they're well aware that they've been deeply
678940	680780	and perhaps permanently fucked.
680780	684320	Ayn Rand-type ideology is no longer going to appeal to these people.
684320	688120	The poor have to identify with the rich in order to worship them, and it's hard to identify
688120	690740	with someone once you realize they've burned you.
690740	697160	All of this has led to the now prevailing anti-establishment mood.
697160	701800	And suddenly, after decades of unquestioned corporate capitalist dominance, other systems
701800	703640	are beginning to look attractive.
703640	707640	This I think is why Bernie Sanders was more successful than any other American socialist
707640	708640	in decades.
708640	712520	For a lot of young people, it seems intolerable to struggle with no end in sight under the
712520	715960	weight of massive student debt, which their whole life system encouraged them to incur
715960	719000	when they were teenagers who didn't know what they were getting into.
719000	723200	Without much hope of home ownership, retirement, or other comforts their parents took for granted,
723200	727020	a lot of millennials are burning with frustration and resentment at the financial elite that
727020	729560	reaps most of the wealth of the global economy.
729560	733280	Bernie Sanders became the champion of that frustration, but he failed to win the Democratic
733280	737640	nomination, partly because he was never able to successfully appeal to black and Hispanic
737640	738640	voters.
738640	742120	So Clinton became the nominee, but she was unable to gain traction outside the base of
742120	743120	the Democratic party.
743120	747560	She was particularly bad at responding effectively to the new white disaffection, and her image
747560	752040	as a scandal-laden career politician with corporate ties made her seem like the avatar
752040	754720	of everything wrong with the Washington establishment.
754720	758660	Now whenever the working and middle classes get into a deep enough funk, there's two things
758660	759880	that usually happen.
759880	763560	Either they go socialist and turn against the corporate goons that burned them, or they
763560	767080	lose their fucking minds pursuing some racial minority scapegoat.
767080	771520	So summer 2016 rolls around, and the major parties nominate their candidates.
771520	774560	Exit Bernie Sanders, enter Donald Trump.
774560	778480	Trump is a demagogue the likes of which American presidential politics hasn't seen in more
778480	779760	than a century.
779760	785260	He makes absurd promises to bring back the jobs, great jobs, the best jobs, it's gonna
785260	787120	be terrific, it's gonna be huge.
787120	791960	Oh, and he also coyly points the finger at blacks, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, and the
791960	796200	politically correct culture that keeps white America from saying what it's really thinking.
796200	799560	And once that ball starts rolling, the media can't look away.
799600	803400	The country's comparatively few misdeeds are easy for people to stay focused on.
803400	807340	Meanwhile, Trump advocates that we commit war crimes, claims that Mexican immigrants
807340	811840	are rapists, brags about grabbing women by the pussy, and generally behaves so badly
811840	816880	so frequently that the media can't even really make time to digest any given scandal.
816880	820600	And in fact, people who are sick of having to keep their ugly prejudices to themselves
820600	823200	feel liberated by Trump's disdain for common decency.
823200	827640	If there's any truth to the tantrum against political correctionists hypothesis, it might
827640	832000	even be the case that some people supported Trump because of his open contempt for women
832000	834280	and popularity with racist hate groups.
834280	837560	Now I know that some people had other reasons for supporting Trump, you know, they believe
837560	841600	he'll shake things up or something, but you still chose to vote for him knowing full well
841600	845960	the kind of rhetoric he was using, and I think you have to take responsibility for that.
845960	849760	Whatever the reason, one in four eligible voters cast their ballot for him, and that
849760	851500	was enough to get him to the White House.
851500	855640	So the question now is what to do with Mr. Trump.
855640	857400	Parte Cinque.
857400	859520	What to do with Mr. Trump.
859520	863100	Well that's a question we're going to have to keep answering for the next four years.
863100	868120	For the time being, I strongly support nonviolent protests and demonstrations against Trump.
868120	872040	It's important that we let all the people who Trump has disparaged and blamed and abused
872040	875640	know that we have their backs, and that we're willing to put up an act of resistance to
875640	877540	Trump and everything he represents.
877540	881280	The Democrats are a minority in both the House and Senate, but they could pursue the same
881280	885340	obstructionism that Republicans have used against Obama for the last eight years.
885340	888820	Of course, this will continue the degradation and sabotage of the legislative branch that
888820	893460	the Republicans began, but it might be worth it to prevent, for instance, the repeal of
893460	894460	Obamacare.
894460	898020	For the most part, we have to place our hope in the 2018 and 2020 elections.
898020	901380	Merely waiting for time to pass will help, since Trump is not going to be able to make
901380	902980	good on his promises.
902980	906940	Well-paying manufacturing jobs are not going to come back, Muslims and immigrants are not
906940	911300	going away, and I dare him to try to build that fucking wall.
911300	913460	Public opinion can change very quickly.
913460	918640	Nixon went by a landslide in 1972, and then resigned in disgrace a few years later.
918640	923060	Trump is highly prone to scandals, he's going to fuck things up, and now that he is the
923060	927040	political establishment, people will blame him for everything that goes wrong, and his
927040	930020	stupid antics will lose their insurrectional charm.
930020	933220	I also have a couple suggestions for things not to do.
933220	935020	Number one, don't riot.
935020	939020	I enjoy smashing and burning shit as much as the next guy, but it helps nothing, and
939020	943460	it will be used as an excuse for more brutal policing and incarceration, along with all
943460	946100	the racial disparities that that entails.
946100	948620	Number two, do not kill yourself.
948620	950140	There's no time for that now.
950140	951660	There are people who need your help.
951660	956380	Now, losing an election to a villainous prick can be genuinely traumatic, I understand,
956380	960340	especially if you belong to a group that feels suddenly unwelcome in this country.
960340	964100	Hunter S. Thompson described the scene in Washington after the progressive McGovern
964100	968180	lost to Nixon in 72 as complete weeping chaos.
968180	971580	People you'd never expect to break down stumbled off the plane in tears, and it was like a
971580	973940	funeral after a mass murder or something.
973940	975980	I lost my composure too, I admit.
975980	979340	I drank myself into a stupor and tweeted some dumb things.
979340	980860	But it's time to regroup.
980860	984660	In times of grave defeat, I like to remember the words of a little man you may have forgotten
984660	989180	about called Satan, who, awaking in the pit of hell after being cast from heaven, enjoined
989180	995060	his comrades to consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy.
995060	1002340	Our own loss, our repair, how overcome this dire calamity, what reinforcement we may gain
1002340	1009340	from hope, if not, what resolution from despair.
1009340	1013300	Well, down with Trump.
1013300	1019180	Hail Satan.
