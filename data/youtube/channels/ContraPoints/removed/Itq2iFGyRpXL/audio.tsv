0	14180	Hi, my name is Nick. I am a YouTuber formerly known as Nickatine2, currently posting on
14180	20940	the Nick Sci-Fi account here on YouTube. I'm making this video to tell you to subscribe
20940	27060	to my new account, as my old one has just been suspended for two weeks. Now, the cause
27060	33220	of this suspension is one earlier video of mine which was flagged and removed about six
33220	39940	months ago for being somewhat offensive to Christians, bless their little souls. Now,
39940	44580	the most recent video of mine to have been flagged and removed was a video called The
44580	53580	Chilling Effects of Tickle Porn, which featured a 28-second segment of a young woman wearing
53580	61600	a shirt and panties being tickled on her exposed navel. Now, this video in no way violates
61600	67540	YouTube's terms of service. In fact, I downloaded the video off of YouTube. It had been up here
67540	73180	already for several months and had more than 100,000 views. Now, keep in mind that the
73180	79220	average Hot for Words videos contains material more sexually explicit than this. The average
79220	86020	movie trailer contains material with more exposed female flesh than my video. The average
86020	93100	video YouTube features on its page contains more sexual activity than the video I uploaded.
93100	98540	In fact, I have seen more sexually explicit material in footage of the New York Stock
98540	104100	Exchange than I have seen in the video for which I have been suspended. But nevertheless,
104100	109180	YouTube has decided that my video was just too offensive to keep on their website. It
109180	113980	would just offend the people so much that they would stop clicking on advertisements.
113980	118980	They lose all their ad revenue because, God forbid, someone has uploaded a picture with
118980	121700	a female stomach. Holy shit!
