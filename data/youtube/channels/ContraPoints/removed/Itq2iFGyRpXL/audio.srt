Hi, my name is Nick. I am a YouTuber formerly known as Nickatine2, currently posting on

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:20,940
the Nick Sci-Fi account here on YouTube. I'm making this video to tell you to subscribe

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,060
to my new account, as my old one has just been suspended for two weeks. Now, the cause

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,220
of this suspension is one earlier video of mine which was flagged and removed about six

5
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,940
months ago for being somewhat offensive to Christians, bless their little souls. Now,

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,580
the most recent video of mine to have been flagged and removed was a video called The

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:53,580
Chilling Effects of Tickle Porn, which featured a 28-second segment of a young woman wearing

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:01,600
a shirt and panties being tickled on her exposed navel. Now, this video in no way violates

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,540
YouTube's terms of service. In fact, I downloaded the video off of YouTube. It had been up here

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,180
already for several months and had more than 100,000 views. Now, keep in mind that the

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,220
average Hot for Words videos contains material more sexually explicit than this. The average

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:26,020
movie trailer contains material with more exposed female flesh than my video. The average

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:33,100
video YouTube features on its page contains more sexual activity than the video I uploaded.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,540
In fact, I have seen more sexually explicit material in footage of the New York Stock

15
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,100
Exchange than I have seen in the video for which I have been suspended. But nevertheless,

16
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,180
YouTube has decided that my video was just too offensive to keep on their website. It

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,980
would just offend the people so much that they would stop clicking on advertisements.

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,980
They lose all their ad revenue because, God forbid, someone has uploaded a picture with

19
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,700
a female stomach. Holy shit!
