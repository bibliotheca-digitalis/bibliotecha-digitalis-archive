1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome to my very scientific race laboratory!

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,360
May the pure light of reason guide us!

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:33,800
We'll begin by measuring the superior dimensions of the caucasoid skull.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,840
Tis evident to every scientific inquirer that nature hath seen fit to divide the creature

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,280
man into several distinct classes, whereof a manifest hierarchy subsists.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,480
Lord Foppington, what are you doing in my lab?

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm delineating the crania of the plurality of humankinds.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
Well the 18th century called, they want their ideas back.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,920
Well the anime convention called, they want their wig back.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Foppington!

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Get out of my lab!

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,720
Before I slice you on the slab!

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Nay!

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Nay!

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Nay!

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Nay!

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Nay!

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Nay!

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Nay!

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Nay!

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,500
90% of you fucking people you have to talk to in this line of work…

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,340
Where's my pepsi?

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
Part One.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,900
Race and Biology.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,460
Because racist pseudoscience has often served as an alibi to genocide, slavery, eugenics,

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,920
discrimination, imperialism, medical abuse, and torture, many people are understandably

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,480
reluctant to broach the subject of biology and race.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,080
Unfortunately, this kind of reluctance can look like a kind of politically correct avoidance

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120
of the truth.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,540
So let's just do away with all the reluctance, and begin by seeking out an answer to the

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,060
question, is there any biological reality to race, following the evidence wherever it

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
may lead.

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Yay, Varily!

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,580
How did you get there?

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,900
Apparently this hallway is just one long circuit.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,500
Well go away!

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,480
Now if we're being honest with ourselves, it's very difficult to approach a topic

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,260
as politically loaded as race without bringing a lot of baggage to the table.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,180
But one way we might try to start from a more objective standpoint is to try a thought experiment

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,100
proposed by the YouTuber Concordance, namely, to imagine that an alien species landed on

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,060
Earth with our understanding of genetics, but without our knowledge of human social

42
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,060
and political history.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,200
Would it occur to these alien scientists to divide human beings into the conventional

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,680
racial categories of black, white, Asian, and so on?

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,100
The answer to this question is a pretty definite no.

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,340
Let's take a look at why.

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,420
Geneticists measure human variation by comparing the frequency of genetic markers between different

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
populations.

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,420
It's pretty well known that around 85% of genetic variation is found within groups,

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,300
meaning that any two individuals from different populations are not likely to be much more

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,500
different than any two individuals from the same population.

52
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,740
And only around 6-10% of total variation is found between continental groups, what might

53
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,940
imprecisely be called races.

54
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,300
Now 6-10% is not zero, so you might think there is some justification for traditional

55
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,020
race categories based on continental origin.

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,340
However, for most of human history there has been continuous gene flow between local populations,

57
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,540
including across continental divides.

58
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,620
So there are no distinct boundaries separating continental populations from each other, and

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,820
the continental populations themselves are not homogenous.

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,260
This is evident when you look at, for instance, the distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,040
across the globe.

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,080
Categories like white, black, and Asian are therefore extremely arbitrary ways of dividing

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
up the genetic continuum.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,740
In fact, there is no purely genetic justification for using, say, five race categories as opposed

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,920
to just one, or three hundred, or three million.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,100
And because of global gene flow, there are no pure races, no matter how many categories

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,860
you choose, with the possible exception of some Pacific Islanders.

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,800
This is especially true in countries with recent global immigration like the US and

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Brazil, where mixed European, African, and Amerindian ancestry is the norm.

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
These points are all made more eloquently, and in much more detail in a two-part video

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,180
by Concordance, which I highly recommend and have linked to in the description.

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,480
The upshot is that while geneticists and physical anthropologists can divide humans into populations

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,040
based on ancestry, there is no scientific reason for those divisions to track traditional

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
race categories.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,320
This is because race is a pre-scientific folk taxonomy based on superficial phenotypic attributes

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,900
like hair and skin color, which are what biologists call polyphyletic, that is, derived from multiple

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,280
ancestral sources.

78
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,020
Compare, for instance, the dark skin of sub-saharan Africans with that of the genetically distant

79
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,680
Australian aborigines.

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Race, as commonly understood, is therefore a social construct, but this is not to say

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,320
that there is no biological variation due to ancestry, only that traditional race categories

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,920
are not a good way to understand that variation.

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,800
Race realists like to use dog breeds as a counter example that's supposed to show

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,520
that everything I've said so far would imply that the distinction between Chihuahuas and

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,960
Great Danes is a social construct, which they take to be self-evidently absurd.

86
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,360
Now this is a bad analogy, since dog breeds are deeply inbred by human design, whereas

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,560
human populations are constantly mating outside the group.

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,960
However, the example does provide an interesting illustration of the relationship between social

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,800
constructs and biology.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,680
Dog breeds are biologically real because of human social practices, so in a sense dog

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,440
breeds are biologically distinct, although they're not natural.

92
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,020
And this biology-nature distinction is a useful distinction to have, since racial injustice

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,040
can lead to conditions of poverty, malnutrition, environmental toxins, and so on that can then

94
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,800
have a biological effect.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,200
So just like with gender, we shouldn't think of race as either biological or a social

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
construct.

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,080
It's both, and the relationship between biology and society is very complex.

98
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,120
And it involves causation in both directions.

99
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,880
So when I say race is a social construct, I'm not saying that biologists and anthropologists

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,240
shouldn't use categories like haplogroups and clines to describe human populations.

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm simply saying that race is at best a very crude approximation of these categories.

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,640
And that crude approximation may well be useful in certain forensic and medical contexts,

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,840
but we should keep in mind that categories of race are based more on social and political

104
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,720
divisions than pure biology.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,440
The racial categories used in the US census are the product of the political history of

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,720
the United States.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,420
People who we'd consider white, black, and Hispanic here might be categorized totally

108
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,840
differently in Brazil, where different demographics and history have led to different race concepts.

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,760
This is all good and well, but when are we going to measure the skulls?

110
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,720
If I may quote a friend of mine, what is it with you people and skulls?

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
Is it so wrong to enjoy the touch of cold bones?

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:54,400
Part 2.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
The Origin of the Idea of Race

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,020
Race realists like to talk about race as if it were a natural, intuitive concept believed

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,840
by everyone except a few politically correct postmodernists who have somehow deceived themselves

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
into not seeing the obvious.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,760
It's therefore worth looking at the history of the concept of race to see if it's really

118
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,480
as universal as they say.

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,240
I'll start, like any true defender of Western civilization, with ancient Greeks.

120
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,320
I can find no evidence that the Greeks had anything like our concept of race, that is,

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,280
a division of human beings into different kinds with unique physical and psychological

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
attributes on the basis of ancestry.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
This is not to say that the Greeks had no concept of ethnicity.

124
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,720
They definitely did, and a very ethnocentric one at that.

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,240
There were Greeks, and there were the obviously inferior barbarians, that is, non-Greeks.

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,420
But the Greeks defined themselves and distinguished themselves from say, the Persians or Egyptians

127
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,500
by their language and customs, not their biology or ancestry.

128
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,180
Aristotle's political philosophy included the idea of natural slaves, people who are

129
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,940
by nature the tools and property of the natural masters.

130
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Now Greek slavery was not based on race, so there was no need to introduce a concept of

131
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,660
race to justify it.

132
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,820
Instead, Aristotle introduces a natural slave class to explain why slavery is totally natural

133
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,780
and fine, don't even worry about it, like, literally at all.

134
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,160
But clearly this is just a post hoc biological rationalization for the political hierarchy

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,220
of the time.

136
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,540
There are no slave Greeks or master Greeks, but it's a lot easier to see that when your

137
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,240
society is not founded on the idea of there being slave Greeks.

138
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,740
So with that in mind, it should not come as much of a surprise that Europeans first really

139
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,500
started talking about race in the 17th century, around the time that slavery and colonialism

140
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,260
were really kicking into gear.

141
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,300
My time has come!

142
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,780
Your time has gone.

143
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,780
Oh.

144
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,020
Arguably, the ideas of this goddamn bastard were first foreshadowed during the Spanish

145
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,760
Inquisition, when Christian converts became suspect, and Torquemada started inquiring

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,560
into defendants' ancestry using pure Christian bloodline as a criterion of religious authenticity.

147
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,380
Race first became the object of scientific study, with Francois Bernier's 1684 treatise

148
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,740
on the subject.

149
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,180
Until around the time of Charles Darwin, scientific racism was the only game in town, with naturalists,

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,440
anthropologists, and philosophers generally ranking the races, always with Caucasians

151
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,600
at the top, using such scientific criteria as dietary and sartorial customs, physical

152
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,860
beauty, and alleged sexual appetite.

153
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,540
Here's Carl Linnaeus, creator of Argenus' species nomenclature, on the subject of the

154
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Asiaticus.

155
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,500
Yellow, melancholic, stiff.

156
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Black hair, dark eyes.

157
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Severe, haughty, greedy.

158
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,380
Covered with loose clothing, and regulated by opinions.

159
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,140
And here is Johann Friedrich Blumenbach on the term Caucasian, which he coined.

160
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,940
I have taken the name of this variety from Mt. Caucasus, both because its neighborhood,

161
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,940
and especially its southern slope, produces the most beautiful race of men, I mean the

162
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,220
Georgian, and because all physiological reasons converge to this, that in that region, if

163
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,480
anywhere, it seems we ought, with the greatest probability, to place the autochthonies of

164
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
mankind.

165
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,780
And here's Immanuel Kant, who never left his hometown.

166
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,360
The yellow Indians do have a meager talent.

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,820
The Negroes are far below them, and at the lowest point are a part of the American people.

168
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,280
Wow.

169
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,600
Very science.

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,060
Much objective.

171
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,940
So reason!

172
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,020
Basically what happened is that scientific insights, not much exceeding the drunken hunches

173
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,240
of any backwoods doofus, were used, along with some self-interested biblical hermeneutics,

174
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,980
to justify centuries of slavery and colonialism.

175
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,940
And the situation didn't improve much by the beginning of the last century, when crude

176
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,820
biological determinism was used to justify an American eugenics program of immigration

177
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,140
restriction, forced sterilization, and euthanasia that later inspired the Nazis.

178
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,860
Speaking of which, let's not forget about…

179
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
The Jews.

180
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess famously said that national socialism is nothing but applied

181
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,800
biology, and we could call this way of thinking biopolitics.

182
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,920
The idea is that the nation is the race, and the race is like an organism, so people

183
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,240
of other races—homosexuals, degenerates, criminals, race traitors, and so on—are

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,340
contaminants, vermin, or agents of infection.

185
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,880
It follows from this view that immigration should be banned, homosexuals should be euthanized

186
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,800
or cured—and this also applies to trans people, by the way—and degenerates and criminals

187
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
should be sterilized.

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,360
Now I know you're probably saying, Godwin's law!

189
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,880
You compare everyone you disagree with to Hitler and the Holocaust!

190
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,920
But look, the historical facts are what they are, and I understand that it's upsetting

191
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,060
to you that I would dare bring this up, but I don't respect your willful obliviousness

192
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,240
to historical precedent.

193
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,780
The historical record shows that race has always been a political concept, and an extremely

194
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,360
dangerous one at that.

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,280
So my view that race is not a valid biological concept is not a case of political correctness

196
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
invading biology.

197
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,360
In fact, it's exactly the opposite, an effort to liberate biology from an inherently political

198
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,720
concept that it doesn't need and that humanity is better without.

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,400
Yes, yes, but then how will we know to which of the four humors the races correspond?

200
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,820
Well gee, I guess we'll never know.

201
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,780
Part 3.

202
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,720
Race as a Social Construct and Individual Identity

203
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,880
Race may be a social construct, but it's not an illusion.

204
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,440
It's real in the way that money is real, it affects the way we all experience the world,

205
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,600
and real people are privileged and disadvantaged because of it.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,080
So even if our goal is a society where race doesn't exist, we can't get there by denying

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,480
the political reality of race and racial injustice.

208
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,080
Color blindness, in other words, is not the answer.

209
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,920
However, as society becomes more multiracial and as there are more mixed race people around,

210
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,520
it does get harder and harder to say what the nature of race as a social construct is.

211
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,120
The ambiguity of race was highlighted by the case of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who

212
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,800
fabricated her biography and lived for a decade passing as a black woman.

213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Now I'm not convinced there's a legitimate analogy between race and gender when it comes

214
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,060
to psychological self-identification, so I don't think Rachel Dolezal is a black.

215
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,040
But I do think her story raises complicated questions about what makes a person black

216
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
or white.

217
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Is it the way people perceive you, or a certain cultural upbringing?

218
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,800
Or maybe having certain racial experiences, like being disadvantaged or oppressed in certain

219
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
ways?

220
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,060
Because Rachel Dolezal lied about so many of her experiences, she's maybe not a great

221
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,260
case study.

222
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,820
But suppose, hypothetically, it turned out that one of her parents was black after all.

223
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,420
Or suppose she really were the victim of hate crimes, or was discriminated against due to

224
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,540
her perceived blackness, or suppose she was raised by black parents.

225
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,540
I don't think there is a definite answer to whether a person in those circumstances

226
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,180
is black or white, but I do think that asking the question reveals the inherent ambiguity

227
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,660
of the concept of race.

228
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,700
Alright doc, I can't stand it anymore, when are we going to measure these bones?

229
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,460
Oh my god, shut up about the fucking bones.

230
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,420
Well can I at least do blackface?

231
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
Absolutely not.

232
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Well why not?

233
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,380
Are you two politically correct?

234
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,780
Well I did this fucking shit and people still haven't forgiven me.

235
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,140
Alright, so hear me out.

236
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
No.

237
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,340
It's ironic blackface, like the joke is that it's racist.

238
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,260
You are an actual lord of shit, you know that?

239
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,180
Well what if I only do half of my face?

240
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Still no.

241
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
That's not racist is it?

242
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
No it's still racist.

243
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,140
One dot of black paint isn't racist.

244
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
Shut up.

245
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,580
The center of my face has to be painted black before it's racist.

246
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,860
Look you wanna measure some bones?

247
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,060
Why don't we start with yours?

248
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,860
I like to grind the dust of racist bones.

249
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,380
I like to mix it with my milk.

250
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,100
It's how I stay so white.

251
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,540
It's how I stay so...

252
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
Pure.

253
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,740
I love it.
