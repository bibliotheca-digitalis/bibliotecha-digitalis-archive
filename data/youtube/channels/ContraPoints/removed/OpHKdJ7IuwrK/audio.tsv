0	7520	Welcome to my very scientific race laboratory!
7520	14360	May the pure light of reason guide us!
14360	33800	We'll begin by measuring the superior dimensions of the caucasoid skull.
33800	38840	Tis evident to every scientific inquirer that nature hath seen fit to divide the creature
38840	44280	man into several distinct classes, whereof a manifest hierarchy subsists.
44280	47480	Lord Foppington, what are you doing in my lab?
47480	50800	I'm delineating the crania of the plurality of humankinds.
50800	54000	Well the 18th century called, they want their ideas back.
54000	56920	Well the anime convention called, they want their wig back.
56920	57920	Foppington!
57920	58920	Get out of my lab!
58920	60720	Before I slice you on the slab!
60720	61720	Nay!
61720	62720	Nay!
62720	63720	Nay!
63720	64720	Nay!
64720	65720	Nay!
65720	66720	Nay!
66720	67720	Nay!
67720	68720	Nay!
68960	71500	90% of you fucking people you have to talk to in this line of work…
71500	73340	Where's my pepsi?
73340	74340	Part One.
74340	75900	Race and Biology.
75900	81460	Because racist pseudoscience has often served as an alibi to genocide, slavery, eugenics,
81460	85920	discrimination, imperialism, medical abuse, and torture, many people are understandably
85920	89480	reluctant to broach the subject of biology and race.
89480	93080	Unfortunately, this kind of reluctance can look like a kind of politically correct avoidance
93080	94120	of the truth.
94120	97540	So let's just do away with all the reluctance, and begin by seeking out an answer to the
97540	102060	question, is there any biological reality to race, following the evidence wherever it
102060	103060	may lead.
103060	104060	Yay, Varily!
104060	105580	How did you get there?
105580	107900	Apparently this hallway is just one long circuit.
107900	110500	Well go away!
110500	113480	Now if we're being honest with ourselves, it's very difficult to approach a topic
113480	117260	as politically loaded as race without bringing a lot of baggage to the table.
117260	121180	But one way we might try to start from a more objective standpoint is to try a thought experiment
121180	126100	proposed by the YouTuber Concordance, namely, to imagine that an alien species landed on
126100	130060	Earth with our understanding of genetics, but without our knowledge of human social
130060	131060	and political history.
131060	135200	Would it occur to these alien scientists to divide human beings into the conventional
135200	138680	racial categories of black, white, Asian, and so on?
138680	141100	The answer to this question is a pretty definite no.
141100	143340	Let's take a look at why.
143340	147420	Geneticists measure human variation by comparing the frequency of genetic markers between different
147420	148420	populations.
148420	153420	It's pretty well known that around 85% of genetic variation is found within groups,
153420	157300	meaning that any two individuals from different populations are not likely to be much more
157300	160500	different than any two individuals from the same population.
160500	165740	And only around 6-10% of total variation is found between continental groups, what might
165740	167940	imprecisely be called races.
167940	172300	Now 6-10% is not zero, so you might think there is some justification for traditional
172300	175020	race categories based on continental origin.
175020	180340	However, for most of human history there has been continuous gene flow between local populations,
180340	182540	including across continental divides.
182540	186620	So there are no distinct boundaries separating continental populations from each other, and
186620	189820	the continental populations themselves are not homogenous.
189820	194260	This is evident when you look at, for instance, the distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups
194260	196040	across the globe.
196040	200080	Categories like white, black, and Asian are therefore extremely arbitrary ways of dividing
200080	201080	up the genetic continuum.
201080	206740	In fact, there is no purely genetic justification for using, say, five race categories as opposed
206740	209920	to just one, or three hundred, or three million.
210120	214100	And because of global gene flow, there are no pure races, no matter how many categories
214100	217860	you choose, with the possible exception of some Pacific Islanders.
217860	221800	This is especially true in countries with recent global immigration like the US and
221800	226400	Brazil, where mixed European, African, and Amerindian ancestry is the norm.
226400	229840	These points are all made more eloquently, and in much more detail in a two-part video
229840	234180	by Concordance, which I highly recommend and have linked to in the description.
234180	239480	The upshot is that while geneticists and physical anthropologists can divide humans into populations
239480	244040	based on ancestry, there is no scientific reason for those divisions to track traditional
244040	245360	race categories.
245360	250320	This is because race is a pre-scientific folk taxonomy based on superficial phenotypic attributes
250320	255900	like hair and skin color, which are what biologists call polyphyletic, that is, derived from multiple
255900	257280	ancestral sources.
257280	262020	Compare, for instance, the dark skin of sub-saharan Africans with that of the genetically distant
262020	263680	Australian aborigines.
263680	268480	Race, as commonly understood, is therefore a social construct, but this is not to say
268480	273320	that there is no biological variation due to ancestry, only that traditional race categories
273320	275920	are not a good way to understand that variation.
275920	279800	Race realists like to use dog breeds as a counter example that's supposed to show
279800	283520	that everything I've said so far would imply that the distinction between Chihuahuas and
283520	287960	Great Danes is a social construct, which they take to be self-evidently absurd.
287960	292360	Now this is a bad analogy, since dog breeds are deeply inbred by human design, whereas
292360	295560	human populations are constantly mating outside the group.
295640	299960	However, the example does provide an interesting illustration of the relationship between social
299960	301800	constructs and biology.
301800	306680	Dog breeds are biologically real because of human social practices, so in a sense dog
306680	310440	breeds are biologically distinct, although they're not natural.
310440	315020	And this biology-nature distinction is a useful distinction to have, since racial injustice
315020	320040	can lead to conditions of poverty, malnutrition, environmental toxins, and so on that can then
320040	321800	have a biological effect.
321800	326200	So just like with gender, we shouldn't think of race as either biological or a social
326200	327200	construct.
327200	331080	It's both, and the relationship between biology and society is very complex.
331080	334120	And it involves causation in both directions.
334120	338880	So when I say race is a social construct, I'm not saying that biologists and anthropologists
338880	343240	shouldn't use categories like haplogroups and clines to describe human populations.
343240	348480	I'm simply saying that race is at best a very crude approximation of these categories.
348480	352640	And that crude approximation may well be useful in certain forensic and medical contexts,
352640	356840	but we should keep in mind that categories of race are based more on social and political
356840	358720	divisions than pure biology.
358720	362440	The racial categories used in the US census are the product of the political history of
362440	363720	the United States.
363720	367420	People who we'd consider white, black, and Hispanic here might be categorized totally
367420	372840	differently in Brazil, where different demographics and history have led to different race concepts.
372840	376760	This is all good and well, but when are we going to measure the skulls?
376760	380720	If I may quote a friend of mine, what is it with you people and skulls?
380720	384880	Is it so wrong to enjoy the touch of cold bones?
406760	414400	Part 2.
414400	416800	The Origin of the Idea of Race
416800	421020	Race realists like to talk about race as if it were a natural, intuitive concept believed
421020	425840	by everyone except a few politically correct postmodernists who have somehow deceived themselves
425840	427280	into not seeing the obvious.
427280	430760	It's therefore worth looking at the history of the concept of race to see if it's really
430760	432480	as universal as they say.
432480	437240	I'll start, like any true defender of Western civilization, with ancient Greeks.
437240	441320	I can find no evidence that the Greeks had anything like our concept of race, that is,
441320	445280	a division of human beings into different kinds with unique physical and psychological
445280	447680	attributes on the basis of ancestry.
447680	450560	This is not to say that the Greeks had no concept of ethnicity.
450560	453720	They definitely did, and a very ethnocentric one at that.
453720	458240	There were Greeks, and there were the obviously inferior barbarians, that is, non-Greeks.
458240	462420	But the Greeks defined themselves and distinguished themselves from say, the Persians or Egyptians
462580	466500	by their language and customs, not their biology or ancestry.
466500	471180	Aristotle's political philosophy included the idea of natural slaves, people who are
471180	474940	by nature the tools and property of the natural masters.
474940	478940	Now Greek slavery was not based on race, so there was no need to introduce a concept of
478940	480660	race to justify it.
480660	485820	Instead, Aristotle introduces a natural slave class to explain why slavery is totally natural
485820	489780	and fine, don't even worry about it, like, literally at all.
489780	494160	But clearly this is just a post hoc biological rationalization for the political hierarchy
494160	495220	of the time.
495220	499540	There are no slave Greeks or master Greeks, but it's a lot easier to see that when your
499540	503240	society is not founded on the idea of there being slave Greeks.
503240	506740	So with that in mind, it should not come as much of a surprise that Europeans first really
506740	511500	started talking about race in the 17th century, around the time that slavery and colonialism
511500	513260	were really kicking into gear.
513260	514300	My time has come!
514300	515780	Your time has gone.
515780	516780	Oh.
517100	521020	Arguably, the ideas of this goddamn bastard were first foreshadowed during the Spanish
521020	525760	Inquisition, when Christian converts became suspect, and Torquemada started inquiring
525760	531560	into defendants' ancestry using pure Christian bloodline as a criterion of religious authenticity.
531560	536380	Race first became the object of scientific study, with Francois Bernier's 1684 treatise
536380	537740	on the subject.
537740	543180	Until around the time of Charles Darwin, scientific racism was the only game in town, with naturalists,
543180	547440	anthropologists, and philosophers generally ranking the races, always with Caucasians
547440	552600	at the top, using such scientific criteria as dietary and sartorial customs, physical
552600	554860	beauty, and alleged sexual appetite.
554860	559540	Here's Carl Linnaeus, creator of Argenus' species nomenclature, on the subject of the
559540	560540	Asiaticus.
560540	563500	Yellow, melancholic, stiff.
563500	565100	Black hair, dark eyes.
565100	567100	Severe, haughty, greedy.
567100	570380	Covered with loose clothing, and regulated by opinions.
570380	574140	And here is Johann Friedrich Blumenbach on the term Caucasian, which he coined.
574140	578940	I have taken the name of this variety from Mt. Caucasus, both because its neighborhood,
578940	582940	and especially its southern slope, produces the most beautiful race of men, I mean the
582940	588220	Georgian, and because all physiological reasons converge to this, that in that region, if
588220	592480	anywhere, it seems we ought, with the greatest probability, to place the autochthonies of
592480	593480	mankind.
593480	596780	And here's Immanuel Kant, who never left his hometown.
596780	599360	The yellow Indians do have a meager talent.
599360	604820	The Negroes are far below them, and at the lowest point are a part of the American people.
604820	606280	Wow.
606280	607600	Very science.
607600	609060	Much objective.
609060	610940	So reason!
610940	615020	Basically what happened is that scientific insights, not much exceeding the drunken hunches
615020	620240	of any backwoods doofus, were used, along with some self-interested biblical hermeneutics,
620240	622980	to justify centuries of slavery and colonialism.
622980	626940	And the situation didn't improve much by the beginning of the last century, when crude
626940	631820	biological determinism was used to justify an American eugenics program of immigration
631820	637140	restriction, forced sterilization, and euthanasia that later inspired the Nazis.
637140	639860	Speaking of which, let's not forget about…
639860	640860	The Jews.
640860	645860	Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess famously said that national socialism is nothing but applied
645860	649800	biology, and we could call this way of thinking biopolitics.
649800	653920	The idea is that the nation is the race, and the race is like an organism, so people
653920	659240	of other races—homosexuals, degenerates, criminals, race traitors, and so on—are
659240	662340	contaminants, vermin, or agents of infection.
662340	666880	It follows from this view that immigration should be banned, homosexuals should be euthanized
666880	671800	or cured—and this also applies to trans people, by the way—and degenerates and criminals
671800	672800	should be sterilized.
672800	676360	Now I know you're probably saying, Godwin's law!
676360	679880	You compare everyone you disagree with to Hitler and the Holocaust!
679880	683920	But look, the historical facts are what they are, and I understand that it's upsetting
683920	688060	to you that I would dare bring this up, but I don't respect your willful obliviousness
688060	689240	to historical precedent.
689240	693780	The historical record shows that race has always been a political concept, and an extremely
693780	695360	dangerous one at that.
695360	700280	So my view that race is not a valid biological concept is not a case of political correctness
700280	701280	invading biology.
701280	706360	In fact, it's exactly the opposite, an effort to liberate biology from an inherently political
706360	709720	concept that it doesn't need and that humanity is better without.
709720	715400	Yes, yes, but then how will we know to which of the four humors the races correspond?
715400	718820	Well gee, I guess we'll never know.
718820	719780	Part 3.
719780	722720	Race as a Social Construct and Individual Identity
722720	725880	Race may be a social construct, but it's not an illusion.
725880	730440	It's real in the way that money is real, it affects the way we all experience the world,
730440	733600	and real people are privileged and disadvantaged because of it.
733600	738080	So even if our goal is a society where race doesn't exist, we can't get there by denying
738080	741480	the political reality of race and racial injustice.
741480	744080	Color blindness, in other words, is not the answer.
744080	748920	However, as society becomes more multiracial and as there are more mixed race people around,
748920	753520	it does get harder and harder to say what the nature of race as a social construct is.
753520	758120	The ambiguity of race was highlighted by the case of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who
758120	762800	fabricated her biography and lived for a decade passing as a black woman.
762800	766160	Now I'm not convinced there's a legitimate analogy between race and gender when it comes
766160	771060	to psychological self-identification, so I don't think Rachel Dolezal is a black.
771060	775040	But I do think her story raises complicated questions about what makes a person black
775040	776040	or white.
776040	779440	Is it the way people perceive you, or a certain cultural upbringing?
779440	783800	Or maybe having certain racial experiences, like being disadvantaged or oppressed in certain
783800	784800	ways?
784800	788060	Because Rachel Dolezal lied about so many of her experiences, she's maybe not a great
788060	789260	case study.
789260	793820	But suppose, hypothetically, it turned out that one of her parents was black after all.
793820	797420	Or suppose she really were the victim of hate crimes, or was discriminated against due to
797420	800540	her perceived blackness, or suppose she was raised by black parents.
800540	804540	I don't think there is a definite answer to whether a person in those circumstances
804540	809180	is black or white, but I do think that asking the question reveals the inherent ambiguity
809180	810660	of the concept of race.
810660	814700	Alright doc, I can't stand it anymore, when are we going to measure these bones?
814700	818460	Oh my god, shut up about the fucking bones.
818460	820420	Well can I at least do blackface?
820420	821820	Absolutely not.
821820	822820	Well why not?
822820	824380	Are you two politically correct?
824380	827780	Well I did this fucking shit and people still haven't forgiven me.
827780	829140	Alright, so hear me out.
829140	830140	No.
830140	833340	It's ironic blackface, like the joke is that it's racist.
833340	835260	You are an actual lord of shit, you know that?
835260	837180	Well what if I only do half of my face?
837180	838180	Still no.
838180	839180	That's not racist is it?
839180	840180	No it's still racist.
840180	842140	One dot of black paint isn't racist.
842140	843140	Shut up.
843140	845580	The center of my face has to be painted black before it's racist.
845580	846860	Look you wanna measure some bones?
846860	851060	Why don't we start with yours?
851060	854860	I like to grind the dust of racist bones.
854860	858380	I like to mix it with my milk.
858380	861100	It's how I stay so white.
861100	863540	It's how I stay so...
863540	864540	Pure.
864540	870740	I love it.
