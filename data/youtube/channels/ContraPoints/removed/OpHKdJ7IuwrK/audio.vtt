00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Welcome to my very scientific race laboratory!

00:07.520 --> 00:14.360
May the pure light of reason guide us!

00:14.360 --> 00:33.800
We'll begin by measuring the superior dimensions of the caucasoid skull.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.840
Tis evident to every scientific inquirer that nature hath seen fit to divide the creature

00:38.840 --> 00:44.280
man into several distinct classes, whereof a manifest hierarchy subsists.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.480
Lord Foppington, what are you doing in my lab?

00:47.480 --> 00:50.800
I'm delineating the crania of the plurality of humankinds.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.000
Well the 18th century called, they want their ideas back.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.920
Well the anime convention called, they want their wig back.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
Foppington!

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
Get out of my lab!

00:58.920 --> 01:00.720
Before I slice you on the slab!

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
Nay!

01:01.720 --> 01:02.720
Nay!

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
Nay!

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Nay!

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
Nay!

01:05.720 --> 01:06.720
Nay!

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
Nay!

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
Nay!

01:08.960 --> 01:11.500
90% of you fucking people you have to talk to in this line of workâ€¦

01:11.500 --> 01:13.340
Where's my pepsi?

01:13.340 --> 01:14.340
Part One.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.900
Race and Biology.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.460
Because racist pseudoscience has often served as an alibi to genocide, slavery, eugenics,

01:21.460 --> 01:25.920
discrimination, imperialism, medical abuse, and torture, many people are understandably

01:25.920 --> 01:29.480
reluctant to broach the subject of biology and race.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.080
Unfortunately, this kind of reluctance can look like a kind of politically correct avoidance

01:33.080 --> 01:34.120
of the truth.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.540
So let's just do away with all the reluctance, and begin by seeking out an answer to the

01:37.540 --> 01:42.060
question, is there any biological reality to race, following the evidence wherever it

01:42.060 --> 01:43.060
may lead.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.060
Yay, Varily!

01:44.060 --> 01:45.580
How did you get there?

01:45.580 --> 01:47.900
Apparently this hallway is just one long circuit.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.500
Well go away!

01:50.500 --> 01:53.480
Now if we're being honest with ourselves, it's very difficult to approach a topic

01:53.480 --> 01:57.260
as politically loaded as race without bringing a lot of baggage to the table.

01:57.260 --> 02:01.180
But one way we might try to start from a more objective standpoint is to try a thought experiment

02:01.180 --> 02:06.100
proposed by the YouTuber Concordance, namely, to imagine that an alien species landed on

02:06.100 --> 02:10.060
Earth with our understanding of genetics, but without our knowledge of human social

02:10.060 --> 02:11.060
and political history.

02:11.060 --> 02:15.200
Would it occur to these alien scientists to divide human beings into the conventional

02:15.200 --> 02:18.680
racial categories of black, white, Asian, and so on?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.100
The answer to this question is a pretty definite no.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.340
Let's take a look at why.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.420
Geneticists measure human variation by comparing the frequency of genetic markers between different

02:27.420 --> 02:28.420
populations.

02:28.420 --> 02:33.420
It's pretty well known that around 85% of genetic variation is found within groups,

02:33.420 --> 02:37.300
meaning that any two individuals from different populations are not likely to be much more

02:37.300 --> 02:40.500
different than any two individuals from the same population.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.740
And only around 6-10% of total variation is found between continental groups, what might

02:45.740 --> 02:47.940
imprecisely be called races.

02:47.940 --> 02:52.300
Now 6-10% is not zero, so you might think there is some justification for traditional

02:52.300 --> 02:55.020
race categories based on continental origin.

02:55.020 --> 03:00.340
However, for most of human history there has been continuous gene flow between local populations,

03:00.340 --> 03:02.540
including across continental divides.

03:02.540 --> 03:06.620
So there are no distinct boundaries separating continental populations from each other, and

03:06.620 --> 03:09.820
the continental populations themselves are not homogenous.

03:09.820 --> 03:14.260
This is evident when you look at, for instance, the distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups

03:14.260 --> 03:16.040
across the globe.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.080
Categories like white, black, and Asian are therefore extremely arbitrary ways of dividing

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
up the genetic continuum.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.740
In fact, there is no purely genetic justification for using, say, five race categories as opposed

03:26.740 --> 03:29.920
to just one, or three hundred, or three million.

03:30.120 --> 03:34.100
And because of global gene flow, there are no pure races, no matter how many categories

03:34.100 --> 03:37.860
you choose, with the possible exception of some Pacific Islanders.

03:37.860 --> 03:41.800
This is especially true in countries with recent global immigration like the US and

03:41.800 --> 03:46.400
Brazil, where mixed European, African, and Amerindian ancestry is the norm.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.840
These points are all made more eloquently, and in much more detail in a two-part video

03:49.840 --> 03:54.180
by Concordance, which I highly recommend and have linked to in the description.

03:54.180 --> 03:59.480
The upshot is that while geneticists and physical anthropologists can divide humans into populations

03:59.480 --> 04:04.040
based on ancestry, there is no scientific reason for those divisions to track traditional

04:04.040 --> 04:05.360
race categories.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.320
This is because race is a pre-scientific folk taxonomy based on superficial phenotypic attributes

04:10.320 --> 04:15.900
like hair and skin color, which are what biologists call polyphyletic, that is, derived from multiple

04:15.900 --> 04:17.280
ancestral sources.

04:17.280 --> 04:22.020
Compare, for instance, the dark skin of sub-saharan Africans with that of the genetically distant

04:22.020 --> 04:23.680
Australian aborigines.

04:23.680 --> 04:28.480
Race, as commonly understood, is therefore a social construct, but this is not to say

04:28.480 --> 04:33.320
that there is no biological variation due to ancestry, only that traditional race categories

04:33.320 --> 04:35.920
are not a good way to understand that variation.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.800
Race realists like to use dog breeds as a counter example that's supposed to show

04:39.800 --> 04:43.520
that everything I've said so far would imply that the distinction between Chihuahuas and

04:43.520 --> 04:47.960
Great Danes is a social construct, which they take to be self-evidently absurd.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.360
Now this is a bad analogy, since dog breeds are deeply inbred by human design, whereas

04:52.360 --> 04:55.560
human populations are constantly mating outside the group.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.960
However, the example does provide an interesting illustration of the relationship between social

04:59.960 --> 05:01.800
constructs and biology.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.680
Dog breeds are biologically real because of human social practices, so in a sense dog

05:06.680 --> 05:10.440
breeds are biologically distinct, although they're not natural.

05:10.440 --> 05:15.020
And this biology-nature distinction is a useful distinction to have, since racial injustice

05:15.020 --> 05:20.040
can lead to conditions of poverty, malnutrition, environmental toxins, and so on that can then

05:20.040 --> 05:21.800
have a biological effect.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.200
So just like with gender, we shouldn't think of race as either biological or a social

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
construct.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.080
It's both, and the relationship between biology and society is very complex.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.120
And it involves causation in both directions.

05:34.120 --> 05:38.880
So when I say race is a social construct, I'm not saying that biologists and anthropologists

05:38.880 --> 05:43.240
shouldn't use categories like haplogroups and clines to describe human populations.

05:43.240 --> 05:48.480
I'm simply saying that race is at best a very crude approximation of these categories.

05:48.480 --> 05:52.640
And that crude approximation may well be useful in certain forensic and medical contexts,

05:52.640 --> 05:56.840
but we should keep in mind that categories of race are based more on social and political

05:56.840 --> 05:58.720
divisions than pure biology.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.440
The racial categories used in the US census are the product of the political history of

06:02.440 --> 06:03.720
the United States.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.420
People who we'd consider white, black, and Hispanic here might be categorized totally

06:07.420 --> 06:12.840
differently in Brazil, where different demographics and history have led to different race concepts.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.760
This is all good and well, but when are we going to measure the skulls?

06:16.760 --> 06:20.720
If I may quote a friend of mine, what is it with you people and skulls?

06:20.720 --> 06:24.880
Is it so wrong to enjoy the touch of cold bones?

06:46.760 --> 06:54.400
Part 2.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.800
The Origin of the Idea of Race

06:56.800 --> 07:01.020
Race realists like to talk about race as if it were a natural, intuitive concept believed

07:01.020 --> 07:05.840
by everyone except a few politically correct postmodernists who have somehow deceived themselves

07:05.840 --> 07:07.280
into not seeing the obvious.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.760
It's therefore worth looking at the history of the concept of race to see if it's really

07:10.760 --> 07:12.480
as universal as they say.

07:12.480 --> 07:17.240
I'll start, like any true defender of Western civilization, with ancient Greeks.

07:17.240 --> 07:21.320
I can find no evidence that the Greeks had anything like our concept of race, that is,

07:21.320 --> 07:25.280
a division of human beings into different kinds with unique physical and psychological

07:25.280 --> 07:27.680
attributes on the basis of ancestry.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.560
This is not to say that the Greeks had no concept of ethnicity.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.720
They definitely did, and a very ethnocentric one at that.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.240
There were Greeks, and there were the obviously inferior barbarians, that is, non-Greeks.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.420
But the Greeks defined themselves and distinguished themselves from say, the Persians or Egyptians

07:42.580 --> 07:46.500
by their language and customs, not their biology or ancestry.

07:46.500 --> 07:51.180
Aristotle's political philosophy included the idea of natural slaves, people who are

07:51.180 --> 07:54.940
by nature the tools and property of the natural masters.

07:54.940 --> 07:58.940
Now Greek slavery was not based on race, so there was no need to introduce a concept of

07:58.940 --> 08:00.660
race to justify it.

08:00.660 --> 08:05.820
Instead, Aristotle introduces a natural slave class to explain why slavery is totally natural

08:05.820 --> 08:09.780
and fine, don't even worry about it, like, literally at all.

08:09.780 --> 08:14.160
But clearly this is just a post hoc biological rationalization for the political hierarchy

08:14.160 --> 08:15.220
of the time.

08:15.220 --> 08:19.540
There are no slave Greeks or master Greeks, but it's a lot easier to see that when your

08:19.540 --> 08:23.240
society is not founded on the idea of there being slave Greeks.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.740
So with that in mind, it should not come as much of a surprise that Europeans first really

08:26.740 --> 08:31.500
started talking about race in the 17th century, around the time that slavery and colonialism

08:31.500 --> 08:33.260
were really kicking into gear.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.300
My time has come!

08:34.300 --> 08:35.780
Your time has gone.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.780
Oh.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.020
Arguably, the ideas of this goddamn bastard were first foreshadowed during the Spanish

08:41.020 --> 08:45.760
Inquisition, when Christian converts became suspect, and Torquemada started inquiring

08:45.760 --> 08:51.560
into defendants' ancestry using pure Christian bloodline as a criterion of religious authenticity.

08:51.560 --> 08:56.380
Race first became the object of scientific study, with Francois Bernier's 1684 treatise

08:56.380 --> 08:57.740
on the subject.

08:57.740 --> 09:03.180
Until around the time of Charles Darwin, scientific racism was the only game in town, with naturalists,

09:03.180 --> 09:07.440
anthropologists, and philosophers generally ranking the races, always with Caucasians

09:07.440 --> 09:12.600
at the top, using such scientific criteria as dietary and sartorial customs, physical

09:12.600 --> 09:14.860
beauty, and alleged sexual appetite.

09:14.860 --> 09:19.540
Here's Carl Linnaeus, creator of Argenus' species nomenclature, on the subject of the

09:19.540 --> 09:20.540
Asiaticus.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.500
Yellow, melancholic, stiff.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.100
Black hair, dark eyes.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.100
Severe, haughty, greedy.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.380
Covered with loose clothing, and regulated by opinions.

09:30.380 --> 09:34.140
And here is Johann Friedrich Blumenbach on the term Caucasian, which he coined.

09:34.140 --> 09:38.940
I have taken the name of this variety from Mt. Caucasus, both because its neighborhood,

09:38.940 --> 09:42.940
and especially its southern slope, produces the most beautiful race of men, I mean the

09:42.940 --> 09:48.220
Georgian, and because all physiological reasons converge to this, that in that region, if

09:48.220 --> 09:52.480
anywhere, it seems we ought, with the greatest probability, to place the autochthonies of

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
mankind.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.780
And here's Immanuel Kant, who never left his hometown.

09:56.780 --> 09:59.360
The yellow Indians do have a meager talent.

09:59.360 --> 10:04.820
The Negroes are far below them, and at the lowest point are a part of the American people.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.280
Wow.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.600
Very science.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.060
Much objective.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.940
So reason!

10:10.940 --> 10:15.020
Basically what happened is that scientific insights, not much exceeding the drunken hunches

10:15.020 --> 10:20.240
of any backwoods doofus, were used, along with some self-interested biblical hermeneutics,

10:20.240 --> 10:22.980
to justify centuries of slavery and colonialism.

10:22.980 --> 10:26.940
And the situation didn't improve much by the beginning of the last century, when crude

10:26.940 --> 10:31.820
biological determinism was used to justify an American eugenics program of immigration

10:31.820 --> 10:37.140
restriction, forced sterilization, and euthanasia that later inspired the Nazis.

10:37.140 --> 10:39.860
Speaking of which, let's not forget aboutâ€¦

10:39.860 --> 10:40.860
The Jews.

10:40.860 --> 10:45.860
Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess famously said that national socialism is nothing but applied

10:45.860 --> 10:49.800
biology, and we could call this way of thinking biopolitics.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.920
The idea is that the nation is the race, and the race is like an organism, so people

10:53.920 --> 10:59.240
of other racesâ€”homosexuals, degenerates, criminals, race traitors, and so onâ€”are

10:59.240 --> 11:02.340
contaminants, vermin, or agents of infection.

11:02.340 --> 11:06.880
It follows from this view that immigration should be banned, homosexuals should be euthanized

11:06.880 --> 11:11.800
or curedâ€”and this also applies to trans people, by the wayâ€”and degenerates and criminals

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
should be sterilized.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.360
Now I know you're probably saying, Godwin's law!

11:16.360 --> 11:19.880
You compare everyone you disagree with to Hitler and the Holocaust!

11:19.880 --> 11:23.920
But look, the historical facts are what they are, and I understand that it's upsetting

11:23.920 --> 11:28.060
to you that I would dare bring this up, but I don't respect your willful obliviousness

11:28.060 --> 11:29.240
to historical precedent.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.780
The historical record shows that race has always been a political concept, and an extremely

11:33.780 --> 11:35.360
dangerous one at that.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.280
So my view that race is not a valid biological concept is not a case of political correctness

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
invading biology.

11:41.280 --> 11:46.360
In fact, it's exactly the opposite, an effort to liberate biology from an inherently political

11:46.360 --> 11:49.720
concept that it doesn't need and that humanity is better without.

11:49.720 --> 11:55.400
Yes, yes, but then how will we know to which of the four humors the races correspond?

11:55.400 --> 11:58.820
Well gee, I guess we'll never know.

11:58.820 --> 11:59.780
Part 3.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.720
Race as a Social Construct and Individual Identity

12:02.720 --> 12:05.880
Race may be a social construct, but it's not an illusion.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.440
It's real in the way that money is real, it affects the way we all experience the world,

12:10.440 --> 12:13.600
and real people are privileged and disadvantaged because of it.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.080
So even if our goal is a society where race doesn't exist, we can't get there by denying

12:18.080 --> 12:21.480
the political reality of race and racial injustice.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.080
Color blindness, in other words, is not the answer.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.920
However, as society becomes more multiracial and as there are more mixed race people around,

12:28.920 --> 12:33.520
it does get harder and harder to say what the nature of race as a social construct is.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.120
The ambiguity of race was highlighted by the case of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who

12:38.120 --> 12:42.800
fabricated her biography and lived for a decade passing as a black woman.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.160
Now I'm not convinced there's a legitimate analogy between race and gender when it comes

12:46.160 --> 12:51.060
to psychological self-identification, so I don't think Rachel Dolezal is a black.

12:51.060 --> 12:55.040
But I do think her story raises complicated questions about what makes a person black

12:55.040 --> 12:56.040
or white.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.440
Is it the way people perceive you, or a certain cultural upbringing?

12:59.440 --> 13:03.800
Or maybe having certain racial experiences, like being disadvantaged or oppressed in certain

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
ways?

13:04.800 --> 13:08.060
Because Rachel Dolezal lied about so many of her experiences, she's maybe not a great

13:08.060 --> 13:09.260
case study.

13:09.260 --> 13:13.820
But suppose, hypothetically, it turned out that one of her parents was black after all.

13:13.820 --> 13:17.420
Or suppose she really were the victim of hate crimes, or was discriminated against due to

13:17.420 --> 13:20.540
her perceived blackness, or suppose she was raised by black parents.

13:20.540 --> 13:24.540
I don't think there is a definite answer to whether a person in those circumstances

13:24.540 --> 13:29.180
is black or white, but I do think that asking the question reveals the inherent ambiguity

13:29.180 --> 13:30.660
of the concept of race.

13:30.660 --> 13:34.700
Alright doc, I can't stand it anymore, when are we going to measure these bones?

13:34.700 --> 13:38.460
Oh my god, shut up about the fucking bones.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.420
Well can I at least do blackface?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.820
Absolutely not.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.820
Well why not?

13:42.820 --> 13:44.380
Are you two politically correct?

13:44.380 --> 13:47.780
Well I did this fucking shit and people still haven't forgiven me.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.140
Alright, so hear me out.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.140
No.

13:50.140 --> 13:53.340
It's ironic blackface, like the joke is that it's racist.

13:53.340 --> 13:55.260
You are an actual lord of shit, you know that?

13:55.260 --> 13:57.180
Well what if I only do half of my face?

13:57.180 --> 13:58.180
Still no.

13:58.180 --> 13:59.180
That's not racist is it?

13:59.180 --> 14:00.180
No it's still racist.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.140
One dot of black paint isn't racist.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.140
Shut up.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.580
The center of my face has to be painted black before it's racist.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.860
Look you wanna measure some bones?

14:06.860 --> 14:11.060
Why don't we start with yours?

14:11.060 --> 14:14.860
I like to grind the dust of racist bones.

14:14.860 --> 14:18.380
I like to mix it with my milk.

14:18.380 --> 14:21.100
It's how I stay so white.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.540
It's how I stay so...

14:23.540 --> 14:24.540
Pure.

14:24.540 --> 14:30.740
I love it.

14:30.740 --> 14:36.220
