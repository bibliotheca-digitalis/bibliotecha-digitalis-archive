0	9280	Okay, let's try this one more- God damn time.
14280	19280	Oh God, the webcam thing is broken again. I have to do the- ah, Jesus Christ.
19280	22280	Yeah, I gotta re-add the webcam.
31000	40000	Why does technology just not work? Like, I was expecting by 2017 that technology would just work, you know?
40000	42000	But it still doesn't.
48000	50000	Okay, so we're back. We're back.
53000	55000	And...
55000	57000	Alright, I got pop-out chat.
60000	65000	So, so, so, so. Back to where we were. Back to nail polish.
65000	71000	And then after nail polish, we'll try Pokemon and see if that's too much for the goddamn technology.
71000	77000	Alright, hold on. I'm going to re-post Twitter because they wanted me to post it to Twitter again.
77000	80000	But yeah, we'll do nail polish in a second.
80000	84000	I hope you guys are getting a lot of studying done out there or whatever you're doing.
90000	99000	So yeah, what is this? This is, uh...
105000	107000	I don't even know where I got this.
107000	113000	And it's kind of rubbed off. It looks like it's called Spoiled and the color is Bite Me.
113000	117000	No, go with Photo App. I don't want you.
120000	122000	Alright.
139000	141000	And it's tweeted.
142000	145000	Alright.
145000	149000	So, we're going to do nails. And then we're going to look into...
149000	154000	Actually, let's see if I can download the emulator while I'm doing nails.
154000	159000	And hope that doesn't crash. If it crashes again, that's the end. We're saying goodnight.
159000	161000	But hopefully it doesn't.
161000	164000	What's a good Game Boy emulator for PC?
164000	169000	I know OpenEMU is really good for Mac, but I'm on Windows right now.
171000	173000	Okay.
189000	192000	Yeah, Visual Boy Advance. Let's do that.
196000	199000	Visual Boy Advance.
201000	213000	From virus.com.
213000	217000	Sounds reputable.
217000	236000	Oh god, we've got to unpack a zip file. Can we handle this? I don't know.
236000	247000	Extract to... yes.
247000	253000	And now we need to download the Pokemon ROM.
253000	256000	Let's do red or blue. It's not trying to get fancy.
256000	261000	I had blue when I was a kid, so let's do Pokemon Blue ROM.
266000	269000	From virus.com, yes.
269000	274000	Virus.exe, and let's just run that. Yeah, override all antivirus.
274000	276000	Just go ahead and do it.
276000	279000	Fuck it. Trump's president. Fuck it.
279000	282000	Yeah, download all the advertisements too.
297000	304000	Okay, goodnight, Audra. Thanks for being here.
304000	308000	I'm sorry that I sucked at doing this so much.
308000	312000	Yeah, Trump as president is just my excuse for everything I do right now.
312000	317000	It's like, yeah, I'll drink a pint of whiskey and eat an entire shrimp cocktail at 10am.
317000	320000	Trump as president.
326000	334000	Ugh, my head rings.
334000	341000	Extract.
341000	345000	Stop trying to get me to buy the legal version of Winrar.
345000	350000	I'm not buying shit, you pig shit bastards.
357000	362000	Alright, so now what do we do?
362000	364000	We load Visual Boy Advance.
364000	367000	Virus.exe.
386000	391000	Alright, that doesn't seem to be working incredibly well, to be honest.
395000	397000	We'll just wait.
397000	400000	Yeah, it's probably going to end badly.
400000	403000	We know how the last two attempts at playing games have gone.
403000	413000	My assumption is that Visual Boy Advance is going to require less technological capacity than Skyrim or Origin, but who knows.
413000	416000	Let's do the nails in the meantime.
416000	418000	Can we...
418000	419000	There we go.
419000	424000	Oh, wait, no, that didn't really...
424000	429000	Well, yeah, it's just like America is going to end badly. Exactly. Exactly.
429000	441000	Oh my god.
441000	448000	I'm a little bit drunk to be doing this. This is going to come out real bad.
448000	453000	Okay, I just put way too much on.
453000	466000	Oh, whatever. I've got some acetone in qtips, so we're going to fix it.
466000	485000	We could just do talking. That's true.
485000	511000	That's going to be like a dark red metallic color, which I'm getting all over the goddamn place, but I'm going to fix it in a second with qtips.
511000	518000	Okay, I'm just making it worse.
518000	524000	Yeah, I've got acetone, so we're good.
524000	530000	Alright, let's see if I can do this properly.
530000	538000	You guys can't really see what I'm doing, can you?
538000	541000	This is going so badly.
541000	545000	Look what I just did.
545000	555000	Well, I actually wiped it off. It's fine.
555000	565000	What I should do is turn on the...
565000	574000	I should put it on stereo so that I can do this side to side thing when I go from left to right.
574000	581000	Is that good? Okay, let's get rid of the top card, because it actually gives me more control over which side of the microphone I'm talking.
581000	601000	Because I can go over here, and then I can...
601000	608000	I wish I had pop rocks or something to put into my mouth.
608000	615000	You guys are so into this. It's good.
615000	621000	The internet is just endlessly bizarre to me.
621000	631000	Okay, I'm going to put some on the middle finger and hope that it's not a complete disaster, because I suck.
631000	655000	I'm kind of drunk. Okay, that actually didn't go so bad.
655000	660000	I think I probably should do ASMR videos.
660000	666000	Does tapping work? I don't know.
666000	671000	What if I got a makeup brush?
672000	699000	I can hear that.
700000	707000	Maybe I should just do ASMR videos. Why do I talk about politics anyway?
707000	716000	Because I feel I'm pretty good at this.
716000	733000	I don't know why I talk about Donald Trump, because fuck that guy. I could just be doing this and giving people tingles.
733000	750000	Oh my god. I do like the sound of that makeup brush. That's good, right?
750000	756000	Let's try a different brush.
756000	774000	What if... I think this one should be good, right? Oh yeah, that's good.
774000	783000	My next video is not going to be ASMR, but it's pretty funny right now when I'm drunk and it is after midnight.
804000	809000	My nails are not... I'm not making a lot of progress on my nails.
809000	814000	I've got to say, that's been kind of neglected.
814000	824000	This is definitely the after midnight edition.
824000	833000	Oh my god, you're actually getting headphones.
833000	838000	Peaceful transition of capitalism.
838000	846000	Socialist revolution.
846000	855000	It's not really supposed to be lewd. It's not lewd, exactly. It's just supposed to be like an auditory stimulus.
855000	878000	A lot of the times it is on the threshold of lewdness, but that's not really the main point.
879000	883000	Sorry, I just breathed into the microphone. I don't have my popcorn anymore.
883000	889000	How am I naturally lewd?
914000	929000	This is pretty soothing to me, honestly, the sound. I like listening to it out of the headphones.
929000	950000	I don't know why my Gameboy emulator isn't loading, but it's not.
950000	970000	Yeah, the brush is good. The brush is really good.
971000	990000	Okay, I'm going to tell you a story. Are you ready for story time?
990000	1010000	Tell me that you're ready.
1010000	1022000	Okay, I'm going to tell you a story about my friend, who was also my roommate in college, and he was really funny.
1022000	1041000	So this one time, he went on this date with this girl, and she was kind of like a status climber, even though she was only 19 years old, which was kind of weird.
1041000	1063000	But at the school I went to, which was like a private school that I went to for free because nepotism and my dad was a teacher there, there were these people there who were there because they were from poor backgrounds, and they got in and they got scholarships, and they really wanted to be part of the upper class.
1063000	1073000	That's what going to college was to them, and this girl was one of those girls, but she wasn't very experienced in the ways of the world.
1074000	1100000	So she came over to our house that we all lived in, like way too many people in this house, like way beyond the legal limits of what the fire marshal would allow, and they were just in the living room and they decided to watch movies, and they're drinking beer, watching movies, which is a very normal thing to do.
1100000	1127000	And at some point she says, like, is this a thing that you, like they were watching some movie that he wanted to watch, you know, like fucking Reservoir Dogs or something, and something she wanted to watch, you know, like fucking The Phantom of the Opera or something, and she says, can you drink beer while watching movies?
1128000	1136000	And this is like the only thing that we do in this house, so he's like, yeah, yeah you can.
1136000	1163000	So she has two beers, and she throws up on our floor, because she's a noob, so you know, he like gets the towel and cleans up her vomit and puts her on the couch.
1166000	1191000	And eventually walks her home, because she's not feeling well, so they get back to her dorm, and she says, I have to tell you something, and he's like, okay, and she says, I'm seeing someone else.
1192000	1204000	Like in a really dramatic tone of voice, and he's like, oh, and she says, yes, his father is the finest lawyer in all of Zurich.
1205000	1219000	And he's like, okay, and he says, well, my father is but a poor shoe cobbler.
1219000	1236000	At which point they proceed to kiss passionately before he leaves her doorstep and ends that romance forever.
1237000	1252000	It's just one of my favorite stories of all time, because I love the quick widdedness of saying, my father is but a poor shoe cobbler, after he says fucking, she says this shit about the finest lawyer.
1252000	1256000	Like, what does it mean to be the finest lawyer in all of Zurich?
1259000	1266000	That sounds like a 19th century thing, I don't think that's a 21st century thing, I don't think there is a finest lawyer in all of Zurich.
1266000	1284000	Do you want me to tell another story, or should I try to get this emulator to work?
1296000	1324000	Alright, so let me tell you a story about a time that I got into, so this is a legitimate story that I'm not making up anyway, I got into a fight once on a bridge over a pit of alligators, which I know sounds like total bullshit, but I actually have a very plausible explanation for how this happened.
1327000	1346000	So, I was in high school, and I played the cello in the orchestra, because look at me, these are our cello playing hands, these are not fighting hands, right?
1347000	1358000	But the point is, we went on a school orchestra trip, which we had to pay for by selling trash to our neighbors, which I still feel bad about.
1359000	1362000	You know, like Christmas wreaths or some stupid shit like that.
1363000	1373000	So we got on a bus to Orlando, we're down there, the parents have chosen the activities, and one of the activities is gator shining.
1374000	1383000	Which you probably know what it is if you're from Florida, but if you don't, it's a very stupid thing that people, tourists usually I guess, do in Florida.
1384000	1394000	Where what you do is you shine flashlights in the alligator's eyes, and then you throw hot dogs at them and watch the alligators eat the hot dogs.
1394000	1413000	And basically, what happened, so what they do is they take you out to this pier, and you walk on this wooden bridge over this swamp land where there's a ton of alligators.
1413000	1426000	And so we walked out there, and this fucking kid, his name was Matt, and his name really was Matt so it's kind of fucked up that I'm telling you this.
1426000	1438000	But he was like, instead of throwing the hot dogs at the alligators, he was like putting them down girls' shirts.
1439000	1443000	Because he was horny and angry and 16 and didn't know any better.
1443000	1454000	So he was doing that, and then I thought it would be funny to get revenge by putting a hot dog down his pants.
1455000	1471000	So I came up behind him, and I put a hot dog down his pants, and he turned around and clocked me in the side of the head with a flashlight.
1471000	1482000	And it wasn't really, I guess calling this a fight is a bit of an exaggeration because I didn't really fight back because I'm not really much of a fighter to be honest.
1482000	1499000	But there was this, I definitely was smashed in the face with a flashlight, and I definitely reeled back and leaned over the ledge and looked down into a swamp full of hungry alligators.
1499000	1517000	So that's the story of that. I guess that's kind of a disappointing story fundamentally because there's a story where the description of the story is a lot more interesting than the actual story.
1529000	1538000	No, I didn't fuck him up. I've never fucked anyone up. I can't even fuck up Nazis now. Which is too bad, maybe I should.
1538000	1559000	So I've got some good segway stories because I used to be a segway tour guide on the National Mall.
1560000	1581000	And that turns out to be a pretty disturbing gig actually. It sounds like a lot of fun, but what you have to consider is that when you're a segway tour guide, what you're fundamentally doing is teaching eight people how to operate heffy machinery that they've never operated before, and then just kind of like unleashing them in public.
1581000	1584000	It is hell. It's not good.
1585000	1603000	Fortunately I never had anyone really seriously injured on one of my tours, but one of the guys I trained on his first tour, a woman broke her pelvis on the south side of the capitol. Which is in fact horrible.
1603000	1624000	But I had a woman once who, she was not comfortable on it though to begin with, and it was obvious that her boyfriend or her shitty husband or whatever had talked her into it in the first place, which was a pretty common occurrence.
1624000	1653000	Man, you learned a lot of like weird shit about like gender relations working in that job, I'm not kidding. Because like so often you would see like, you would have like married couples, and I was supposed to train them to ride segways, and I would say something to the woman, and she would not quite get it, and then her husband would repeat it back in this like imperious tone of voice, and I would just be like watching this fucking relationship dynamic, and just being like fuck.
1654000	1670000	Like I'm only seeing two hours of these people's lives, but this is like, this is every hour of every day for them. Like this is him like actually, like here's how you load the dishwasher.
1671000	1677000	Because I mean it's not like this is like the one occasion where like that happens to be what their dynamic is.
1678000	1689000	So this particular case, this woman like she obviously is like, but she's like she's not just completely submissive, like she's obviously resentful of this motherfucker.
1690000	1705000	And so sometimes you would have this as a way of like acting against that dynamic is like women would injure themselves on purpose as revenge.
1705000	1725000	Like it's not exact, like I don't know if it was like ever, I don't know if it was like something they would formulate as like a conscious plan, but you could kind of tell that they wanted it just to fucking get back at their shitty husband.
1726000	1734000	That's what happened this time, so I trained them to ride this fucking stupid segway.
1735000	1743000	And she's like obviously not comfortable with it and her husband's like, you're fine honey, you're fine.
1744000	1748000	And I'm just like, I'm not getting paid enough to deal with this, so we're going.
1749000	1764000	So $10 an hour for me and we get out on Pennsylvania Avenue, that's the other crazy thing about it is that the first part of the tour is us driving to the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue.
1765000	1771000	Which is the wide street that runs between the White House and the Capitol building. It's a lot of traffic.
1772000	1783000	So we're going down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue, I have like a fucking microphone headset and they have headphones so that I can talk to them while we're in the middle of the road.
1784000	1795000	And I'm just like, no on your left is the J. Edgar Hoover FBI building. And I had some stupid joke about the building, you know, and everyone's like ha ha ha.
1796000	1800000	Because they're polite and I'm not getting paid enough.
1801000	1812000	And at some point this woman just like starts screaming and she's riding out of the bike lane into the middle of the road.
1812000	1820000	And like if you're going to lose control of the Segway, you should go to the right.
1821000	1826000	Because that way at least you'll be with traffic that's going in the same direction as you.
1827000	1833000	But she decides to fucking veer out into the left into oncoming traffic, which is way worse.
1834000	1844000	So a Segway, the way it works is there's these basically gyroscopes that detect like the direction that your body weight is kind of leaning in.
1845000	1851000	So to move forward, you lean forward, to move back, you move back or to slow down, you lean back.
1852000	1856000	And so she's like, I forgot how to stop. And she's just screaming, I forgot how to stop.
1856000	1865000	She's now in the middle of the street, just like completely out of control, like a rocket with no fins, just blasting off into the distance.
1866000	1873000	And I'm screaming at her to fucking lean back and she's panicking so she can't do anything.
1874000	1881000	And she ran into the curb, thank God, before a car hit her.
1881000	1887000	But like there was like blood coming out of her mouth, there may have been like chipped teeth, I don't know.
1888000	1899000	So I just like call the people back at the business and I'm like, oops, someone got hurt, come deal with it, I'm continuing my chore now.
1900000	1907000	But man, like stuff like that, I would have to get pretty drunk at the end of those days because it was like legitimately disturbing.
1907000	1909000	They were disturbing segway days.
1912000	1917000	Alright, I've been rubbing on this microphone with this brush for a long time, is it time for a change of pace?
1918000	1920000	What other AM smart things can I do?
1927000	1933000	No, having a segway tour in Washington DC is an objectively bad idea, it's really a terrible idea.
1934000	1942000	Tapping, like tapping on a microphone, I feel like I should put something around it, I don't know.
1944000	1948000	That's true, people are always, oh, that's kind of interesting.
1952000	1953000	How's that?
1953000	1954000	How's that?
1963000	1964000	This paper towel.
1983000	1991000	It does work, doesn't it?
2014000	2023000	It's a retrofitted future, it's not that it's lewd, it's just that they get like spinal tingles from it, from the sound.
2026000	2032000	I actually have not read any Kropotkin, I've read like very little of the anarchist literature.
2033000	2042000	I've read a lot of Marxism, and a lot of Marx, a lot of fucking Adorno and all that stuff, but I haven't read that much of the anarchist stuff.
2043000	2046000	It's not like why be represented in academia is a problem.
2047000	2050000	You kind of have to go out of your way to read it, and I haven't done that.
2073000	2089000	Is this tapping good? I don't know. The tapping is like...
2089000	2103000	I know she would, I wish she were here. You guys like the tapping a lot.
2103000	2118000	Yeah, I like the paper towel better too. Why don't we twist the lipstick in now, what does that mean?
2119000	2122000	Like, it doesn't sound like anything.
2128000	2130000	Yeah, it doesn't sound like anything.
2133000	2141000	Well, let's try. This one makes kind of, this one might make a good noise. Let's try this.
2163000	2171000	Hold on, let's try this. This is very ASMR, but let's try the lip smacking thing. I want to try the volume way up, the game way up.
2179000	2183000	Oh god, those girls make these like mouth noises.
2193000	2209000	Oh my god. This is, it is lewd. Well, some of the ASMR stuff gets really lewd. I don't know if I'm up for that.
2209000	2225000	Oh god, it does sound like Undoomed, because Undoomed, he does this. So this is my version of Undoomed, he's like uhhhh.
2226000	2237000	Basically what it is, it's just speaking really close to the microphone, so it should sound like Christian Bale, Batman.
2238000	2249000	But that's like how every male actor talks now. They all talk like ASMR people, they're just like mmm.
2249000	2262000	I'm very masculine because my mouth is so close to the microphone. I hate listening to that shit.
2262000	2280000	I don't know why, I don't know why this is taking such an ASMR. Because half of you guys are cute ASMR fans, that's why.
2293000	2302000	I'm so sorry to all the people who wanted us to talk about serious political issues. But I don't know if that's happening on this stream.
2303000	2309000	I mean maybe, I don't know if someone brings it up. I need pop rocks, that's what I need.
2309000	2322000	Oh god, there's those mouth noises. It's kind of disturbing isn't it? It makes you sort of angry but it's sort of pleasant.
2332000	2335000	Yeah I have politics fatigue, I can't stand it anymore man.
2339000	2358000	Yeah Tyler people ask me that a lot, like what is a good introductory philosophy book. And I honestly don't have something in mind to suggest.
2358000	2379000	I don't know. I mean for like teenagers, Sophie's World is a good novel that sort of covers the history of Western philosophy but it's very teen oriented. It's not so good for adults.
2389000	2399000	I mean if you want to dive into reading primary texts, I can suggest ones that are like relatively easy but still, like you know, really.
2403000	2411000	Do not, yeah don't start with critique of pure reason or you're going to hate philosophy for the rest of your life and you're just going to end up like me so fast.
2411000	2434000	So I don't know, what about like read some of the basic Plato dialogues, like the Apology. Read Plato's Apology, read the Euthyphro, read Descartes' Discourse on Methods or Meditations, read Hume's Inquiry into Human Understanding, read Bertrand Russell's Problems of Philosophy.
2434000	2447000	Those are all like pretty accessible texts that are still like classics of the canon. So if the canon is what you want to learn, those are good places to start.
2448000	2463000	I don't know what to suggest if you want to start with more contemporary stuff or more, if what you want is to get away from the like white male canon then I also don't, I don't know a good place to start.
2464000	2473000	Because so many contemporary authors are so obscure and difficult to read that I don't even want to fucking read them. So I don't know what to suggest.
2477000	2492000	Stoicism is fine, I don't know. I mean stoicism is a good and very particular situation. Like if you're a prisoner of war, stoicism is really going to be helpful.
2492000	2513000	I know some like POWs or fighter pilots used to carry a copy of like Epictetus with them in case they were imprisoned. Because this familiarity with stoicism is so helpful when you're a prisoner and when your life is just shit.
2522000	2547000	There's so many seras in this room losing track. But yeah if you live in a realm of plenty like most of us do it's not, stoicism is kind of hard to get into because you don't want to let go of all earthly possessions when you have so very very many of them.
2552000	2577000	Yeah so actually if you're a scientist Hume is actually a good place to start. Because Hume is like he's an 18th century philosopher but he's like very like worried about like causality and like justifying causality. So hold on a second.
2582000	2610000	There's a long version of this and there's a short version of this but the short version is called An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding which he published after his longer book didn't sell very well because it was too fucking long and hard to read and no one wants to deal with that fucking shit.
2610000	2637000	So this one is kind of like a condensed version of his ideas. But I guess basically the idea about the book was he was kind of responding to the like mechanistic metaphysics of his own century and like to Newtonian physics basically with a kind of like philosophical skepticism based on the idea that you don't know.
2637000	2653000	You can't infer causation from repeated observation which is exactly what science attempts to do. Most in physics you know you formulate a universal law based on the fact that you observe that something seems to always happen this way.
2653000	2673000	And Hume's like skepticism it's really kind of an extreme skepticism was the idea that you just because you observe the same physical interaction again and again doesn't mean why why can you say that you know that's going to be how it happens in the future.
2673000	2684000	That's not a he thought it's not like an a priori truth that observing the same thing over and over again means that it's going to happen again.
2684000	2694000	But ultimately I don't know. This seemed kind of more interesting to me when I was an undergraduate. As an adult it's like yeah but like the same things do happen all over again.
2694000	2708000	So like who cares. And like ultimately that is the solution to philosophy is like yeah but it doesn't matter. So why do we care.
2708000	2723000	My philosopher would recommend for a mathematician maybe try reading some of Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics.
2723000	2730000	I think that stuff is pretty interesting.
2730000	2736000	Why am I talking about philosophy I'm this ASMR voice this is so fucking weird.
2736000	2756000	I also used to actually be a philosophy professor so this is really extra weird because I'm now taking the philosophy professor thing that I've actually done and I'm making it into some like weird ASMR thing it's kind of fucked up.
2756000	2764000	Katara what is which part of this is your fetish.
2764000	2774000	Spitfire that's my favorite question ever is who is the worst philosopher.
2774000	2784000	I think Hegel is the worst philosopher because he can't write in a way that anyone understands.
2784000	2797000	But it's not necessarily that his ideas are the worst. Which philosopher has the worst ideas is I guess a more interesting question. I don't know.
2797000	2810000	Yeah I've watched Philosophy Tube he's really good.
2810000	2822000	I don't know if Ayn Rand even counts as a philosopher. She's more of a literary figure. I guess she thought she was a philosopher I don't know.
2822000	2844000	I don't think anyone really reads Zizek honestly. It's kind of interesting to listen to him jabber on about things like movies and things but I don't read his books because they're too long and hard and boring.
2844000	2860000	Kierkegaard.
2860000	2862000	Pure ideology.
2862000	2871000	Yeah with a lot of this stuff that he's always doing. Someone should make Zizek ASMR which is like sniffing and face touching.
2893000	2909000	Oh my god guys why are we talking about academic philosophy it's like almost one in the morning. We should be enjoying our lives.
2909000	2928000	I don't know anything about sports statistics apart from the vague stuff that I've picked up from fantasy football that I play just to be friendly.
2928000	2945000	If your girlfriend wakes up and sees you watching this that's your problem you're going to have to explain it.
2945000	2957000	What did I enjoy about studying neuroscience. Honestly I just liked learning neuroanatomy. There's nothing very satisfying about learning the structure of your own brain. It's pretty interesting.
2957000	2970000	I got my own brain scanned too. Let's actually see. Maybe we can bring that up. Let's try to bring up a picture of my brain. And we can do brain ASMR.
2987000	3008000	Here we go. Hold on just one second.
3008000	3031000	Hold on just one second.
3031000	3055000	OK. Can you see this.
3055000	3077000	Well here's the brain. This is actually these are actually MRI scans of my brain. It's pretty beautiful brain huh.
3077000	3085000	Well I had the poop emoji saved because it's a very important image. I've got a lot of interesting stuff saved.
3085000	3114000	We have. I guess we do. If I unmute my desktop then we can turn this down. I got this.
3114000	3135000	I got a lot of good stuff on here.
3135000	3140000	All these are all the clips from my last video. Here's my Richard Spencer.
3165000	3189000	It is funny. You've got to admit that it's funny. It's pretty funny. He's also right about to explain Pepe when he gets punched.
3189000	3207000	And here's my efforts to play golf.
3208000	3215000	Oh yeah. The egg bit. Yeah.
3215000	3218000	So this is like this is some serious ASMR here.
3218000	3222000	Look at this.
3222000	3224000	Smashing.
3224000	3230000	And watch the heel. Watch the heel.
3230000	3242000	All right. That's enough of that. This is the stream. The stream has gone too far.
3242000	3271000	Actually your fetish is watching high heels crush things because it is like a genuine fetish. A lot of people are interested in that.
3271000	3277000	Well I don't think the question is Spencer is I thought it was the opposite because obviously punching Spencer is funny.
3277000	3286000	That's not what the question was is the question was like whether it was a good idea to punch Nazis in general because I think I think everyone agrees that punching Spencer is funny.
3286000	3315000	I think it's time to go to bed. I think I'm out of creative energy.
3315000	3321000	I'm resting on my past laurels with these ball crushing videos.
3321000	3329000	So I think this has been a good scream stream. I'd like to do this again.
3329000	3332000	I think I'll see you guys later.
3332000	3335000	So until next time.
