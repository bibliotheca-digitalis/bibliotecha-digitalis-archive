1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Okay, let's try this one more- God damn time.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Oh God, the webcam thing is broken again. I have to do the- ah, Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Yeah, I gotta re-add the webcam.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why does technology just not work? Like, I was expecting by 2017 that technology would just work, you know?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But it still doesn't.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, so we're back. We're back.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And...

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright, I got pop-out chat.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, so, so, so. Back to where we were. Back to nail polish.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And then after nail polish, we'll try Pokemon and see if that's too much for the goddamn technology.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright, hold on. I'm going to re-post Twitter because they wanted me to post it to Twitter again.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But yeah, we'll do nail polish in a second.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I hope you guys are getting a lot of studying done out there or whatever you're doing.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So yeah, what is this? This is, uh...

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't even know where I got this.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And it's kind of rubbed off. It looks like it's called Spoiled and the color is Bite Me.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, go with Photo App. I don't want you.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's tweeted.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Alright.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, we're going to do nails. And then we're going to look into...

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Actually, let's see if I can download the emulator while I'm doing nails.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And hope that doesn't crash. If it crashes again, that's the end. We're saying goodnight.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But hopefully it doesn't.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's a good Game Boy emulator for PC?

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I know OpenEMU is really good for Mac, but I'm on Windows right now.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, Visual Boy Advance. Let's do that.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Visual Boy Advance.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From virus.com.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sounds reputable.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh god, we've got to unpack a zip file. Can we handle this? I don't know.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Extract to... yes.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And now we need to download the Pokemon ROM.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's do red or blue. It's not trying to get fancy.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I had blue when I was a kid, so let's do Pokemon Blue ROM.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
From virus.com, yes.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Virus.exe, and let's just run that. Yeah, override all antivirus.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Just go ahead and do it.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Fuck it. Trump's president. Fuck it.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, download all the advertisements too.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, goodnight, Audra. Thanks for being here.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry that I sucked at doing this so much.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, Trump as president is just my excuse for everything I do right now.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's like, yeah, I'll drink a pint of whiskey and eat an entire shrimp cocktail at 10am.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Trump as president.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ugh, my head rings.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Extract.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Stop trying to get me to buy the legal version of Winrar.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not buying shit, you pig shit bastards.

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Alright, so now what do we do?

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We load Visual Boy Advance.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Virus.exe.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, that doesn't seem to be working incredibly well, to be honest.

55
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We'll just wait.

56
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, it's probably going to end badly.

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We know how the last two attempts at playing games have gone.

58
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My assumption is that Visual Boy Advance is going to require less technological capacity than Skyrim or Origin, but who knows.

59
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's do the nails in the meantime.

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Can we...

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There we go.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, wait, no, that didn't really...

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, yeah, it's just like America is going to end badly. Exactly. Exactly.

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh my god.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm a little bit drunk to be doing this. This is going to come out real bad.

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay, I just put way too much on.

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, whatever. I've got some acetone in qtips, so we're going to fix it.

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We could just do talking. That's true.

69
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's going to be like a dark red metallic color, which I'm getting all over the goddamn place, but I'm going to fix it in a second with qtips.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, I'm just making it worse.

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, I've got acetone, so we're good.

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Alright, let's see if I can do this properly.

73
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You guys can't really see what I'm doing, can you?

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is going so badly.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look what I just did.

76
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, I actually wiped it off. It's fine.

77
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What I should do is turn on the...

78
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I should put it on stereo so that I can do this side to side thing when I go from left to right.

79
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is that good? Okay, let's get rid of the top card, because it actually gives me more control over which side of the microphone I'm talking.

80
00:09:41,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because I can go over here, and then I can...

81
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I wish I had pop rocks or something to put into my mouth.

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You guys are so into this. It's good.

83
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The internet is just endlessly bizarre to me.

84
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, I'm going to put some on the middle finger and hope that it's not a complete disaster, because I suck.

85
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm kind of drunk. Okay, that actually didn't go so bad.

86
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think I probably should do ASMR videos.

87
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Does tapping work? I don't know.

88
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What if I got a makeup brush?

89
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can hear that.

90
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Maybe I should just do ASMR videos. Why do I talk about politics anyway?

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because I feel I'm pretty good at this.

92
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know why I talk about Donald Trump, because fuck that guy. I could just be doing this and giving people tingles.

93
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh my god. I do like the sound of that makeup brush. That's good, right?

94
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's try a different brush.

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What if... I think this one should be good, right? Oh yeah, that's good.

96
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
My next video is not going to be ASMR, but it's pretty funny right now when I'm drunk and it is after midnight.

97
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My nails are not... I'm not making a lot of progress on my nails.

98
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I've got to say, that's been kind of neglected.

99
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is definitely the after midnight edition.

100
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh my god, you're actually getting headphones.

101
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Peaceful transition of capitalism.

102
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Socialist revolution.

103
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not really supposed to be lewd. It's not lewd, exactly. It's just supposed to be like an auditory stimulus.

104
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:38,000
A lot of the times it is on the threshold of lewdness, but that's not really the main point.

105
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sorry, I just breathed into the microphone. I don't have my popcorn anymore.

106
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
How am I naturally lewd?

107
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is pretty soothing to me, honestly, the sound. I like listening to it out of the headphones.

108
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know why my Gameboy emulator isn't loading, but it's not.

109
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah, the brush is good. The brush is really good.

110
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay, I'm going to tell you a story. Are you ready for story time?

111
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Tell me that you're ready.

112
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay, I'm going to tell you a story about my friend, who was also my roommate in college, and he was really funny.

113
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So this one time, he went on this date with this girl, and she was kind of like a status climber, even though she was only 19 years old, which was kind of weird.

114
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But at the school I went to, which was like a private school that I went to for free because nepotism and my dad was a teacher there, there were these people there who were there because they were from poor backgrounds, and they got in and they got scholarships, and they really wanted to be part of the upper class.

115
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's what going to college was to them, and this girl was one of those girls, but she wasn't very experienced in the ways of the world.

116
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So she came over to our house that we all lived in, like way too many people in this house, like way beyond the legal limits of what the fire marshal would allow, and they were just in the living room and they decided to watch movies, and they're drinking beer, watching movies, which is a very normal thing to do.

117
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And at some point she says, like, is this a thing that you, like they were watching some movie that he wanted to watch, you know, like fucking Reservoir Dogs or something, and something she wanted to watch, you know, like fucking The Phantom of the Opera or something, and she says, can you drink beer while watching movies?

118
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And this is like the only thing that we do in this house, so he's like, yeah, yeah you can.

119
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So she has two beers, and she throws up on our floor, because she's a noob, so you know, he like gets the towel and cleans up her vomit and puts her on the couch.

120
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And eventually walks her home, because she's not feeling well, so they get back to her dorm, and she says, I have to tell you something, and he's like, okay, and she says, I'm seeing someone else.

121
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Like in a really dramatic tone of voice, and he's like, oh, and she says, yes, his father is the finest lawyer in all of Zurich.

122
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And he's like, okay, and he says, well, my father is but a poor shoe cobbler.

123
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:36,000
At which point they proceed to kiss passionately before he leaves her doorstep and ends that romance forever.

124
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's just one of my favorite stories of all time, because I love the quick widdedness of saying, my father is but a poor shoe cobbler, after he says fucking, she says this shit about the finest lawyer.

125
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Like, what does it mean to be the finest lawyer in all of Zurich?

126
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That sounds like a 19th century thing, I don't think that's a 21st century thing, I don't think there is a finest lawyer in all of Zurich.

127
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you want me to tell another story, or should I try to get this emulator to work?

128
00:21:36,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Alright, so let me tell you a story about a time that I got into, so this is a legitimate story that I'm not making up anyway, I got into a fight once on a bridge over a pit of alligators, which I know sounds like total bullshit, but I actually have a very plausible explanation for how this happened.

129
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So, I was in high school, and I played the cello in the orchestra, because look at me, these are our cello playing hands, these are not fighting hands, right?

130
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But the point is, we went on a school orchestra trip, which we had to pay for by selling trash to our neighbors, which I still feel bad about.

131
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You know, like Christmas wreaths or some stupid shit like that.

132
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So we got on a bus to Orlando, we're down there, the parents have chosen the activities, and one of the activities is gator shining.

133
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Which you probably know what it is if you're from Florida, but if you don't, it's a very stupid thing that people, tourists usually I guess, do in Florida.

134
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Where what you do is you shine flashlights in the alligator's eyes, and then you throw hot dogs at them and watch the alligators eat the hot dogs.

135
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And basically, what happened, so what they do is they take you out to this pier, and you walk on this wooden bridge over this swamp land where there's a ton of alligators.

136
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And so we walked out there, and this fucking kid, his name was Matt, and his name really was Matt so it's kind of fucked up that I'm telling you this.

137
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But he was like, instead of throwing the hot dogs at the alligators, he was like putting them down girls' shirts.

138
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Because he was horny and angry and 16 and didn't know any better.

139
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So he was doing that, and then I thought it would be funny to get revenge by putting a hot dog down his pants.

140
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So I came up behind him, and I put a hot dog down his pants, and he turned around and clocked me in the side of the head with a flashlight.

141
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And it wasn't really, I guess calling this a fight is a bit of an exaggeration because I didn't really fight back because I'm not really much of a fighter to be honest.

142
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But there was this, I definitely was smashed in the face with a flashlight, and I definitely reeled back and leaned over the ledge and looked down into a swamp full of hungry alligators.

143
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So that's the story of that. I guess that's kind of a disappointing story fundamentally because there's a story where the description of the story is a lot more interesting than the actual story.

144
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No, I didn't fuck him up. I've never fucked anyone up. I can't even fuck up Nazis now. Which is too bad, maybe I should.

145
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So I've got some good segway stories because I used to be a segway tour guide on the National Mall.

146
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And that turns out to be a pretty disturbing gig actually. It sounds like a lot of fun, but what you have to consider is that when you're a segway tour guide, what you're fundamentally doing is teaching eight people how to operate heffy machinery that they've never operated before, and then just kind of like unleashing them in public.

147
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It is hell. It's not good.

148
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Fortunately I never had anyone really seriously injured on one of my tours, but one of the guys I trained on his first tour, a woman broke her pelvis on the south side of the capitol. Which is in fact horrible.

149
00:26:43,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But I had a woman once who, she was not comfortable on it though to begin with, and it was obvious that her boyfriend or her shitty husband or whatever had talked her into it in the first place, which was a pretty common occurrence.

150
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Man, you learned a lot of like weird shit about like gender relations working in that job, I'm not kidding. Because like so often you would see like, you would have like married couples, and I was supposed to train them to ride segways, and I would say something to the woman, and she would not quite get it, and then her husband would repeat it back in this like imperious tone of voice, and I would just be like watching this fucking relationship dynamic, and just being like fuck.

151
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Like I'm only seeing two hours of these people's lives, but this is like, this is every hour of every day for them. Like this is him like actually, like here's how you load the dishwasher.

152
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because I mean it's not like this is like the one occasion where like that happens to be what their dynamic is.

153
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So this particular case, this woman like she obviously is like, but she's like she's not just completely submissive, like she's obviously resentful of this motherfucker.

154
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And so sometimes you would have this as a way of like acting against that dynamic is like women would injure themselves on purpose as revenge.

155
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Like it's not exact, like I don't know if it was like ever, I don't know if it was like something they would formulate as like a conscious plan, but you could kind of tell that they wanted it just to fucking get back at their shitty husband.

156
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's what happened this time, so I trained them to ride this fucking stupid segway.

157
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And she's like obviously not comfortable with it and her husband's like, you're fine honey, you're fine.

158
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And I'm just like, I'm not getting paid enough to deal with this, so we're going.

159
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So $10 an hour for me and we get out on Pennsylvania Avenue, that's the other crazy thing about it is that the first part of the tour is us driving to the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue.

160
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Which is the wide street that runs between the White House and the Capitol building. It's a lot of traffic.

161
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So we're going down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue, I have like a fucking microphone headset and they have headphones so that I can talk to them while we're in the middle of the road.

162
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I'm just like, no on your left is the J. Edgar Hoover FBI building. And I had some stupid joke about the building, you know, and everyone's like ha ha ha.

163
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Because they're polite and I'm not getting paid enough.

164
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And at some point this woman just like starts screaming and she's riding out of the bike lane into the middle of the road.

165
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And like if you're going to lose control of the Segway, you should go to the right.

166
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because that way at least you'll be with traffic that's going in the same direction as you.

167
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But she decides to fucking veer out into the left into oncoming traffic, which is way worse.

168
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So a Segway, the way it works is there's these basically gyroscopes that detect like the direction that your body weight is kind of leaning in.

169
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So to move forward, you lean forward, to move back, you move back or to slow down, you lean back.

170
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And so she's like, I forgot how to stop. And she's just screaming, I forgot how to stop.

171
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:05,000
She's now in the middle of the street, just like completely out of control, like a rocket with no fins, just blasting off into the distance.

172
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And I'm screaming at her to fucking lean back and she's panicking so she can't do anything.

173
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And she ran into the curb, thank God, before a car hit her.

174
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But like there was like blood coming out of her mouth, there may have been like chipped teeth, I don't know.

175
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So I just like call the people back at the business and I'm like, oops, someone got hurt, come deal with it, I'm continuing my chore now.

176
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But man, like stuff like that, I would have to get pretty drunk at the end of those days because it was like legitimately disturbing.

177
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
They were disturbing segway days.

178
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Alright, I've been rubbing on this microphone with this brush for a long time, is it time for a change of pace?

179
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What other AM smart things can I do?

180
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No, having a segway tour in Washington DC is an objectively bad idea, it's really a terrible idea.

181
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Tapping, like tapping on a microphone, I feel like I should put something around it, I don't know.

182
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's true, people are always, oh, that's kind of interesting.

183
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
How's that?

184
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
How's that?

185
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This paper towel.

186
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It does work, doesn't it?

187
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's a retrofitted future, it's not that it's lewd, it's just that they get like spinal tingles from it, from the sound.

188
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I actually have not read any Kropotkin, I've read like very little of the anarchist literature.

189
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I've read a lot of Marxism, and a lot of Marx, a lot of fucking Adorno and all that stuff, but I haven't read that much of the anarchist stuff.

190
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's not like why be represented in academia is a problem.

191
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You kind of have to go out of your way to read it, and I haven't done that.

192
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Is this tapping good? I don't know. The tapping is like...

193
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I know she would, I wish she were here. You guys like the tapping a lot.

194
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, I like the paper towel better too. Why don't we twist the lipstick in now, what does that mean?

195
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like, it doesn't sound like anything.

196
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, it doesn't sound like anything.

197
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well, let's try. This one makes kind of, this one might make a good noise. Let's try this.

198
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Hold on, let's try this. This is very ASMR, but let's try the lip smacking thing. I want to try the volume way up, the game way up.

199
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh god, those girls make these like mouth noises.

200
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh my god. This is, it is lewd. Well, some of the ASMR stuff gets really lewd. I don't know if I'm up for that.

201
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh god, it does sound like Undoomed, because Undoomed, he does this. So this is my version of Undoomed, he's like uhhhh.

202
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Basically what it is, it's just speaking really close to the microphone, so it should sound like Christian Bale, Batman.

203
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But that's like how every male actor talks now. They all talk like ASMR people, they're just like mmm.

204
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm very masculine because my mouth is so close to the microphone. I hate listening to that shit.

205
00:37:42,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't know why, I don't know why this is taking such an ASMR. Because half of you guys are cute ASMR fans, that's why.

206
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm so sorry to all the people who wanted us to talk about serious political issues. But I don't know if that's happening on this stream.

207
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I mean maybe, I don't know if someone brings it up. I need pop rocks, that's what I need.

208
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh god, there's those mouth noises. It's kind of disturbing isn't it? It makes you sort of angry but it's sort of pleasant.

209
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah I have politics fatigue, I can't stand it anymore man.

210
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah Tyler people ask me that a lot, like what is a good introductory philosophy book. And I honestly don't have something in mind to suggest.

211
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know. I mean for like teenagers, Sophie's World is a good novel that sort of covers the history of Western philosophy but it's very teen oriented. It's not so good for adults.

212
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I mean if you want to dive into reading primary texts, I can suggest ones that are like relatively easy but still, like you know, really.

213
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Do not, yeah don't start with critique of pure reason or you're going to hate philosophy for the rest of your life and you're just going to end up like me so fast.

214
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So I don't know, what about like read some of the basic Plato dialogues, like the Apology. Read Plato's Apology, read the Euthyphro, read Descartes' Discourse on Methods or Meditations, read Hume's Inquiry into Human Understanding, read Bertrand Russell's Problems of Philosophy.

215
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Those are all like pretty accessible texts that are still like classics of the canon. So if the canon is what you want to learn, those are good places to start.

216
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't know what to suggest if you want to start with more contemporary stuff or more, if what you want is to get away from the like white male canon then I also don't, I don't know a good place to start.

217
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because so many contemporary authors are so obscure and difficult to read that I don't even want to fucking read them. So I don't know what to suggest.

218
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Stoicism is fine, I don't know. I mean stoicism is a good and very particular situation. Like if you're a prisoner of war, stoicism is really going to be helpful.

219
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I know some like POWs or fighter pilots used to carry a copy of like Epictetus with them in case they were imprisoned. Because this familiarity with stoicism is so helpful when you're a prisoner and when your life is just shit.

220
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:27,000
There's so many seras in this room losing track. But yeah if you live in a realm of plenty like most of us do it's not, stoicism is kind of hard to get into because you don't want to let go of all earthly possessions when you have so very very many of them.

221
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah so actually if you're a scientist Hume is actually a good place to start. Because Hume is like he's an 18th century philosopher but he's like very like worried about like causality and like justifying causality. So hold on a second.

222
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:30,000
There's a long version of this and there's a short version of this but the short version is called An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding which he published after his longer book didn't sell very well because it was too fucking long and hard to read and no one wants to deal with that fucking shit.

223
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So this one is kind of like a condensed version of his ideas. But I guess basically the idea about the book was he was kind of responding to the like mechanistic metaphysics of his own century and like to Newtonian physics basically with a kind of like philosophical skepticism based on the idea that you don't know.

224
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You can't infer causation from repeated observation which is exactly what science attempts to do. Most in physics you know you formulate a universal law based on the fact that you observe that something seems to always happen this way.

225
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And Hume's like skepticism it's really kind of an extreme skepticism was the idea that you just because you observe the same physical interaction again and again doesn't mean why why can you say that you know that's going to be how it happens in the future.

226
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That's not a he thought it's not like an a priori truth that observing the same thing over and over again means that it's going to happen again.

227
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But ultimately I don't know. This seemed kind of more interesting to me when I was an undergraduate. As an adult it's like yeah but like the same things do happen all over again.

228
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So like who cares. And like ultimately that is the solution to philosophy is like yeah but it doesn't matter. So why do we care.

229
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:23,000
My philosopher would recommend for a mathematician maybe try reading some of Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics.

230
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think that stuff is pretty interesting.

231
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Why am I talking about philosophy I'm this ASMR voice this is so fucking weird.

232
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I also used to actually be a philosophy professor so this is really extra weird because I'm now taking the philosophy professor thing that I've actually done and I'm making it into some like weird ASMR thing it's kind of fucked up.

233
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Katara what is which part of this is your fetish.

234
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Spitfire that's my favorite question ever is who is the worst philosopher.

235
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I think Hegel is the worst philosopher because he can't write in a way that anyone understands.

236
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But it's not necessarily that his ideas are the worst. Which philosopher has the worst ideas is I guess a more interesting question. I don't know.

237
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah I've watched Philosophy Tube he's really good.

238
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know if Ayn Rand even counts as a philosopher. She's more of a literary figure. I guess she thought she was a philosopher I don't know.

239
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I don't think anyone really reads Zizek honestly. It's kind of interesting to listen to him jabber on about things like movies and things but I don't read his books because they're too long and hard and boring.

240
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Kierkegaard.

241
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Pure ideology.

242
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah with a lot of this stuff that he's always doing. Someone should make Zizek ASMR which is like sniffing and face touching.

243
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh my god guys why are we talking about academic philosophy it's like almost one in the morning. We should be enjoying our lives.

244
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't know anything about sports statistics apart from the vague stuff that I've picked up from fantasy football that I play just to be friendly.

245
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If your girlfriend wakes up and sees you watching this that's your problem you're going to have to explain it.

246
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:17,000
What did I enjoy about studying neuroscience. Honestly I just liked learning neuroanatomy. There's nothing very satisfying about learning the structure of your own brain. It's pretty interesting.

247
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I got my own brain scanned too. Let's actually see. Maybe we can bring that up. Let's try to bring up a picture of my brain. And we can do brain ASMR.

248
00:49:47,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Here we go. Hold on just one second.

249
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Hold on just one second.

250
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:55,000
OK. Can you see this.

251
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Well here's the brain. This is actually these are actually MRI scans of my brain. It's pretty beautiful brain huh.

252
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Well I had the poop emoji saved because it's a very important image. I've got a lot of interesting stuff saved.

253
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:54,000
We have. I guess we do. If I unmute my desktop then we can turn this down. I got this.

254
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I got a lot of good stuff on here.

255
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
All these are all the clips from my last video. Here's my Richard Spencer.

256
00:52:45,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It is funny. You've got to admit that it's funny. It's pretty funny. He's also right about to explain Pepe when he gets punched.

257
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And here's my efforts to play golf.

258
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Oh yeah. The egg bit. Yeah.

259
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So this is like this is some serious ASMR here.

260
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Look at this.

261
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Smashing.

262
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And watch the heel. Watch the heel.

263
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:02,000
All right. That's enough of that. This is the stream. The stream has gone too far.

264
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Actually your fetish is watching high heels crush things because it is like a genuine fetish. A lot of people are interested in that.

265
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Well I don't think the question is Spencer is I thought it was the opposite because obviously punching Spencer is funny.

266
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That's not what the question was is the question was like whether it was a good idea to punch Nazis in general because I think I think everyone agrees that punching Spencer is funny.

267
00:54:46,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I think it's time to go to bed. I think I'm out of creative energy.

268
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'm resting on my past laurels with these ball crushing videos.

269
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So I think this has been a good scream stream. I'd like to do this again.

270
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I think I'll see you guys later.

271
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So until next time.
