00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Is my hairline receding?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.360
I mean, it's definitely receding.

00:11.360 --> 00:18.720
I've been asking myself this question for 3,527 consecutive days, but it's getting undeniable.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.720
Look at that.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.160
It feels smooth here.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.400
It didn't used to feel smooth here.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.920
Well, let's do the topographic analysis.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.520
It's 4.2 centimeters by 2.8.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.960
Consult the records.

00:41.720 --> 00:47.720
Yeah, the measurements show a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the last 5 years.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.800
The numbers don't lie, girl.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.120
The numbers don't lie.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.840
The Norwood-Hamilton scale is the generally accepted measure of the extent of androgenetic

00:58.840 --> 01:02.720
alopecia, more commonly known as male pattern baldness.

01:02.720 --> 01:08.800
The first indication of inevitable and irreversible hair loss is Norwood-Hamilton stage 2, characterized

01:08.800 --> 01:14.000
by a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the course of about 5 years.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.200
Once Norwood-Hamilton stage 2 is complete, the balding process will continue until you

01:18.200 --> 01:22.040
die, when your corpse will rot on the ground and worms will eat your eyeballs.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.160
Doctors agree that men who allow themselves to reach this stage can never become real

01:26.160 --> 01:29.360
women, have no value, and will never be loved.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.440
Never be loved.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.520
Never be loved.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.640
Never be loved.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
Never be loved.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
Never be loved.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
Never be loved.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
Never be loved.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
Well, that's it.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
It's over for me.

01:39.640 --> 01:44.000
At this point, the only sensible option is... suicide.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.360
Just put a bullet to the brain stem.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.880
I mean, that's the only responsible way to go about this.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.320
If you go in through the mouth, you should be able to nail the medulla right in the center.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.800
Shouldn't take more than a couple seconds.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.360
Bit of a mess, though.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.880
A mess that someone else is going to have to clean up.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.680
And that is not a very nice thing to do to someone.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.240
So I guess I am stuck being alive.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.560
God damn it.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.240
God, you're ugly.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.240
And old.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.160
Can we talk about how old you're getting?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.160
What are these lines?

02:11.160 --> 02:13.400
Ugh, how do I get out of this?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.640
How do I opt out of my own consciousness?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.520
Well, how about this?

02:17.520 --> 02:21.720
I change my name, take ten ambience, bash myself over the head, and pass out on the

02:21.720 --> 02:23.600
next plane to the Dominican Republic.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.720
Oh my god, you cannot just run away to a Caribbean island and escape all your problems.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.000
These are not physical problems, these are problems of the mind.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.840
I mean, am I even actually balding?

02:47.840 --> 02:48.920
Am I just a lunatic?

02:48.920 --> 02:53.080
Are these real measurements, or are these the psychotic scribbles of a delusional transvestite?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.080
You know what?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.960
I don't know, and I don't care.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.160
How can I have spent so much time thinking about this?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.160
This is nothing but vanity.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.400
Don't you have anything more important to think about?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.560
You shallow bitch.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
You shallow bitch.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.840
Oh, but that's a lie, and you know it's a lie.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.400
The human mind is trash.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.520
Hair is what really matters.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.520
Is my hairline receding?

03:26.520 --> 03:31.520
So, I hear you're having some problems with your...genital.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.520
That's right.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.520
Great, great.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.520
Well, we better take a look.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.520
Could you just remove your...

03:41.520 --> 03:45.520
Alright, let's see what we've got here.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.520
My god, it's not even human.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.520
Well, what's wrong with it?

03:54.520 --> 03:57.520
Have you taken any recent trips to the outer solar system?

03:57.520 --> 03:58.520
What?

03:58.520 --> 03:59.520
No.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.520
Well, we can't entirely rule out Cronenberg's disease, but I'd say it's more likely that

04:03.520 --> 04:07.520
you have what we in the medical profession call xenomorphic gender parasitosis.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.520
What does that mean?

04:09.520 --> 04:13.520
It means a parasite from outer space has infected your gender and is eating away at

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
it from the inside.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.520
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.520
Oh, and try to pay attention.

04:39.520 --> 04:44.520
Oh.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.520
Oh.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.520
Ah.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.520
Ah.

04:59.520 --> 05:04.520
Ah.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.520
Ah.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.520
Ah.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.520
Ah.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.520
Ah.

05:24.520 --> 05:29.520
Ah.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.520
Well, that certainly cleared things up.

05:33.520 --> 05:39.520
Indeed. Now, while there is no cure for XGP, there are a range of treatment options available.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.520
So, you're saying I need surgery to affirm the woman I've always been?

05:42.520 --> 05:45.520
No, I'm saying we're going to make you into a man.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.520
How are you going to make me a man?

05:47.520 --> 05:50.520
Simple. Testosterone gas.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.520
Oh, and I'm going to play you Wagner and show you films of manly men until your perversion goes into remission.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.520
Wait, hold on. I don't consent to that.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.520
Shh. You'll soon be fixed.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.520
Fritz, the music, please.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.520
Oh, please don't do that. Please don't.

06:01.520 --> 06:11.520
Get out of there.

06:11.520 --> 06:16.520
Ah.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.520
Ah.

06:21.520 --> 06:26.520
Ah.

06:26.520 --> 06:31.520
Ah.

06:31.520 --> 06:36.520
Ah.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.520
I don't know how to talk like a girl.

06:38.520 --> 06:42.520
Every time I try, all that comes out is the voice of an annoying white bitch.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.520
Can I speak with a manager?

06:45.520 --> 06:48.520
This mimosa doesn't have enough booze in it.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.520
Is this butt plug 100% silicone?

06:51.520 --> 06:56.520
Maybe that's just who I am deep inside. An annoying white bitch.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.520
But of course I inevitably end up slipping back into the creepy cross-dresser voice that I actually have.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.520
Let's go to the club and meet some boys.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.520
So I can fuck them.

07:07.520 --> 07:13.520
God damn it. What do real women talk like? What do real men talk like? What does anybody talk like?

07:13.520 --> 07:16.520
What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?

07:16.520 --> 07:19.520
Socrates, what is talking?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.520
What am I going to do with this baritone voice of mine?

07:22.520 --> 07:25.520
Well, I guess the same thing I do about everything.

07:25.520 --> 07:40.520
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.

07:40.520 --> 07:47.520
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.

07:47.520 --> 07:54.520
The future's uncertain, the end is always near.

07:54.520 --> 08:09.520
Let it roll, baby, roll.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.520
Let it roll all night long.

08:24.520 --> 08:31.520
Let it roll all night long.

08:31.520 --> 08:52.520
Let it roll all night long.

08:52.520 --> 09:13.520
Why do I have hair here? Ugh, disgusting.

09:13.520 --> 09:41.520
It's not even human hair. It's like insect hair.

09:41.520 --> 09:49.520
Well, how do you feel?

09:49.520 --> 09:52.520
Well, I think I'm into dudes now.

09:52.520 --> 09:57.520
The problem is your attitude. If you won't act like a man, how can you think like a man?

09:57.520 --> 10:01.520
And if you won't think like a man, how can you feel like a man?

10:01.520 --> 10:03.520
I don't want to feel like a man.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.520
Why can't you just be a man?

10:06.520 --> 10:14.520
Be a man. Be a man.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.520
This looks good.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.520
If I don't move my arms.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.520
Is there a way to smash my ribs in?

10:22.520 --> 10:26.520
I'll smash him in, I'll smash the shit out of him.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.520
These shoes are cute and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.520
Would you fuck me?

10:33.520 --> 10:44.520
I wouldn't.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.520
Why won't you fuck me?

10:46.520 --> 10:49.520
I don't want to.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.520
Why not?

10:51.520 --> 10:54.520
It makes me feel like a man.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.520
You are a man.

10:57.520 --> 11:03.520
Well, I don't want to be.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.520
What does it even mean to feel like a man?

11:06.520 --> 11:08.520
Well, don't you feel like a woman?

11:08.520 --> 11:11.520
No, I feel like myself.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.520
Well, exactly.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.520
Are you sure you're not just gay?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.520
Yeah, that's what it is. I'm extremely gay.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.520
Alright, well, I'm leaving. Bye.

12:20.520 --> 12:44.520
Thanks for watching!

12:44.520 --> 12:46.520
Thanks for watching!

13:14.520 --> 13:16.520
Thanks for watching!

13:44.520 --> 14:10.520
Is this even real?
