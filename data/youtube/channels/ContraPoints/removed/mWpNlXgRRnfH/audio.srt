1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Is my hairline receding?

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,360
I mean, it's definitely receding.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,720
I've been asking myself this question for 3,527 consecutive days, but it's getting undeniable.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
Look at that.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,160
It feels smooth here.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,400
It didn't used to feel smooth here.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,920
Well, let's do the topographic analysis.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,520
It's 4.2 centimeters by 2.8.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,960
Consult the records.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Yeah, the measurements show a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the last 5 years.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,800
The numbers don't lie, girl.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,120
The numbers don't lie.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,840
The Norwood-Hamilton scale is the generally accepted measure of the extent of androgenetic

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,720
alopecia, more commonly known as male pattern baldness.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,800
The first indication of inevitable and irreversible hair loss is Norwood-Hamilton stage 2, characterized

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,000
by a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the course of about 5 years.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Once Norwood-Hamilton stage 2 is complete, the balding process will continue until you

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,040
die, when your corpse will rot on the ground and worms will eat your eyeballs.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,160
Doctors agree that men who allow themselves to reach this stage can never become real

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,360
women, have no value, and will never be loved.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,440
Never be loved.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,520
Never be loved.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
Never be loved.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Never be loved.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Never be loved.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Never be loved.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Never be loved.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Well, that's it.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
It's over for me.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,000
At this point, the only sensible option is... suicide.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
Just put a bullet to the brain stem.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,880
I mean, that's the only responsible way to go about this.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,320
If you go in through the mouth, you should be able to nail the medulla right in the center.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,800
Shouldn't take more than a couple seconds.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Bit of a mess, though.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,880
A mess that someone else is going to have to clean up.

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
And that is not a very nice thing to do to someone.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,240
So I guess I am stuck being alive.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,560
God damn it.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,240
God, you're ugly.

41
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
And old.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,160
Can we talk about how old you're getting?

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
What are these lines?

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,400
Ugh, how do I get out of this?

45
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,640
How do I opt out of my own consciousness?

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,520
Well, how about this?

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,720
I change my name, take ten ambience, bash myself over the head, and pass out on the

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,600
next plane to the Dominican Republic.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,720
Oh my god, you cannot just run away to a Caribbean island and escape all your problems.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,000
These are not physical problems, these are problems of the mind.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,840
I mean, am I even actually balding?

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,920
Am I just a lunatic?

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,080
Are these real measurements, or are these the psychotic scribbles of a delusional transvestite?

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
You know what?

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't know, and I don't care.

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,160
How can I have spent so much time thinking about this?

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
This is nothing but vanity.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't you have anything more important to think about?

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
You shallow bitch.

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
You shallow bitch.

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, but that's a lie, and you know it's a lie.

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
The human mind is trash.

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,520
Hair is what really matters.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Is my hairline receding?

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,520
So, I hear you're having some problems with your...genital.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
That's right.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Great, great.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Well, we better take a look.

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Could you just remove your...

70
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Alright, let's see what we've got here.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,520
My god, it's not even human.

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Well, what's wrong with it?

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Have you taken any recent trips to the outer solar system?

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
What?

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
No.

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Well, we can't entirely rule out Cronenberg's disease, but I'd say it's more likely that

77
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,520
you have what we in the medical profession call xenomorphic gender parasitosis.

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
What does that mean?

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,520
It means a parasite from outer space has infected your gender and is eating away at

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
it from the inside.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Oh, and try to pay attention.

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Oh.

84
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Oh.

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Ah.

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Ah.

87
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Ah.

88
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Ah.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Ah.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Ah.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Ah.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Ah.

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Well, that certainly cleared things up.

94
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Indeed. Now, while there is no cure for XGP, there are a range of treatment options available.

95
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
So, you're saying I need surgery to affirm the woman I've always been?

96
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
No, I'm saying we're going to make you into a man.

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
How are you going to make me a man?

98
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Simple. Testosterone gas.

99
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh, and I'm going to play you Wagner and show you films of manly men until your perversion goes into remission.

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Wait, hold on. I don't consent to that.

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Shh. You'll soon be fixed.

102
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Fritz, the music, please.

103
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Oh, please don't do that. Please don't.

104
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Get out of there.

105
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Ah.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Ah.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Ah.

108
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Ah.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Ah.

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I don't know how to talk like a girl.

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Every time I try, all that comes out is the voice of an annoying white bitch.

112
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Can I speak with a manager?

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,520
This mimosa doesn't have enough booze in it.

114
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Is this butt plug 100% silicone?

115
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Maybe that's just who I am deep inside. An annoying white bitch.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,520
But of course I inevitably end up slipping back into the creepy cross-dresser voice that I actually have.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Let's go to the club and meet some boys.

118
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
So I can fuck them.

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,520
God damn it. What do real women talk like? What do real men talk like? What does anybody talk like?

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?

121
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Socrates, what is talking?

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
What am I going to do with this baritone voice of mine?

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Well, I guess the same thing I do about everything.

124
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:40,520
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,520
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,520
The future's uncertain, the end is always near.

127
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Let it roll, baby, roll.

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Let it roll all night long.

129
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Let it roll all night long.

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Let it roll all night long.

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Why do I have hair here? Ugh, disgusting.

132
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:41,520
It's not even human hair. It's like insect hair.

133
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Well, how do you feel?

134
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, I think I'm into dudes now.

135
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,520
The problem is your attitude. If you won't act like a man, how can you think like a man?

136
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,520
And if you won't think like a man, how can you feel like a man?

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't want to feel like a man.

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Why can't you just be a man?

139
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Be a man. Be a man.

140
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
This looks good.

141
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,520
If I don't move my arms.

142
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Is there a way to smash my ribs in?

143
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,520
I'll smash him in, I'll smash the shit out of him.

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
These shoes are cute and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

145
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Would you fuck me?

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:44,520
I wouldn't.

147
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Why won't you fuck me?

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I don't want to.

149
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Why not?

150
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
It makes me feel like a man.

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
You are a man.

152
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Well, I don't want to be.

153
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,520
What does it even mean to feel like a man?

154
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Well, don't you feel like a woman?

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,520
No, I feel like myself.

156
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Well, exactly.

157
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Are you sure you're not just gay?

158
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Yeah, that's what it is. I'm extremely gay.

159
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Alright, well, I'm leaving. Bye.

160
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Thanks for watching!

161
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Thanks for watching!

162
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Thanks for watching!

163
00:13:44,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Is this even real?
