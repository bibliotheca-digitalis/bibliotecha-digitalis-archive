0	9440	Is my hairline receding?
9440	11360	I mean, it's definitely receding.
11360	18720	I've been asking myself this question for 3,527 consecutive days, but it's getting undeniable.
18720	19720	Look at that.
19720	21160	It feels smooth here.
21160	23400	It didn't used to feel smooth here.
23960	26920	Well, let's do the topographic analysis.
31640	34520	It's 4.2 centimeters by 2.8.
34520	35960	Consult the records.
41720	47720	Yeah, the measurements show a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the last 5 years.
47720	48800	The numbers don't lie, girl.
48800	50120	The numbers don't lie.
54240	58840	The Norwood-Hamilton scale is the generally accepted measure of the extent of androgenetic
58840	62720	alopecia, more commonly known as male pattern baldness.
62720	68800	The first indication of inevitable and irreversible hair loss is Norwood-Hamilton stage 2, characterized
68800	74000	by a 50% areal increase in temporal recession over the course of about 5 years.
74000	78200	Once Norwood-Hamilton stage 2 is complete, the balding process will continue until you
78200	82040	die, when your corpse will rot on the ground and worms will eat your eyeballs.
82080	86160	Doctors agree that men who allow themselves to reach this stage can never become real
86160	89360	women, have no value, and will never be loved.
89360	90440	Never be loved.
90440	91520	Never be loved.
91520	92640	Never be loved.
92640	93640	Never be loved.
93640	94640	Never be loved.
94640	95640	Never be loved.
95640	96640	Never be loved.
97640	98640	Well, that's it.
98640	99640	It's over for me.
99640	104000	At this point, the only sensible option is... suicide.
104000	105360	Just put a bullet to the brain stem.
105360	107880	I mean, that's the only responsible way to go about this.
107880	111320	If you go in through the mouth, you should be able to nail the medulla right in the center.
111320	112800	Shouldn't take more than a couple seconds.
112800	114360	Bit of a mess, though.
114360	116880	A mess that someone else is going to have to clean up.
116880	119680	And that is not a very nice thing to do to someone.
119680	123240	So I guess I am stuck being alive.
123240	125560	God damn it.
125560	127240	God, you're ugly.
127240	128240	And old.
128240	130160	Can we talk about how old you're getting?
130160	131160	What are these lines?
131160	133400	Ugh, how do I get out of this?
133400	135640	How do I opt out of my own consciousness?
135640	137520	Well, how about this?
137520	141720	I change my name, take ten ambience, bash myself over the head, and pass out on the
141720	143600	next plane to the Dominican Republic.
157600	161720	Oh my god, you cannot just run away to a Caribbean island and escape all your problems.
161720	165000	These are not physical problems, these are problems of the mind.
165000	167840	I mean, am I even actually balding?
167840	168920	Am I just a lunatic?
168920	173080	Are these real measurements, or are these the psychotic scribbles of a delusional transvestite?
173080	174080	You know what?
174080	175960	I don't know, and I don't care.
175960	178160	How can I have spent so much time thinking about this?
178160	179160	This is nothing but vanity.
179160	181400	Don't you have anything more important to think about?
181400	182560	You shallow bitch.
182560	183560	You shallow bitch.
183560	186840	Oh, but that's a lie, and you know it's a lie.
186840	188400	The human mind is trash.
188400	190520	Hair is what really matters.
191520	194520	Is my hairline receding?
206520	211520	So, I hear you're having some problems with your...genital.
211520	212520	That's right.
212520	213520	Great, great.
213520	214520	Well, we better take a look.
214520	216520	Could you just remove your...
221520	225520	Alright, let's see what we've got here.
229520	232520	My god, it's not even human.
232520	234520	Well, what's wrong with it?
234520	237520	Have you taken any recent trips to the outer solar system?
237520	238520	What?
238520	239520	No.
239520	243520	Well, we can't entirely rule out Cronenberg's disease, but I'd say it's more likely that
243520	247520	you have what we in the medical profession call xenomorphic gender parasitosis.
247520	249520	What does that mean?
249520	253520	It means a parasite from outer space has infected your gender and is eating away at
253520	254520	it from the inside.
254520	257520	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
257520	261520	Oh, and try to pay attention.
279520	284520	Oh.
284520	289520	Oh.
289520	294520	Ah.
294520	299520	Ah.
299520	304520	Ah.
304520	309520	Ah.
309520	314520	Ah.
314520	319520	Ah.
319520	324520	Ah.
324520	329520	Ah.
330520	333520	Well, that certainly cleared things up.
333520	339520	Indeed. Now, while there is no cure for XGP, there are a range of treatment options available.
339520	342520	So, you're saying I need surgery to affirm the woman I've always been?
342520	345520	No, I'm saying we're going to make you into a man.
345520	347520	How are you going to make me a man?
347520	350520	Simple. Testosterone gas.
350520	354520	Oh, and I'm going to play you Wagner and show you films of manly men until your perversion goes into remission.
354520	355520	Wait, hold on. I don't consent to that.
355520	357520	Shh. You'll soon be fixed.
358520	359520	Fritz, the music, please.
359520	361520	Oh, please don't do that. Please don't.
361520	371520	Get out of there.
371520	376520	Ah.
376520	381520	Ah.
381520	386520	Ah.
386520	391520	Ah.
391520	396520	Ah.
396520	398520	I don't know how to talk like a girl.
398520	402520	Every time I try, all that comes out is the voice of an annoying white bitch.
402520	405520	Can I speak with a manager?
405520	408520	This mimosa doesn't have enough booze in it.
408520	411520	Is this butt plug 100% silicone?
411520	416520	Maybe that's just who I am deep inside. An annoying white bitch.
416520	421520	But of course I inevitably end up slipping back into the creepy cross-dresser voice that I actually have.
421520	424520	Let's go to the club and meet some boys.
424520	427520	So I can fuck them.
427520	433520	God damn it. What do real women talk like? What do real men talk like? What does anybody talk like?
433520	436520	What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?
436520	439520	Socrates, what is talking?
439520	442520	What am I going to do with this baritone voice of mine?
442520	445520	Well, I guess the same thing I do about everything.
445520	460520	I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.
460520	467520	I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.
467520	474520	The future's uncertain, the end is always near.
474520	489520	Let it roll, baby, roll.
489520	495520	Let it roll all night long.
504520	511520	Let it roll all night long.
511520	532520	Let it roll all night long.
532520	553520	Why do I have hair here? Ugh, disgusting.
553520	581520	It's not even human hair. It's like insect hair.
581520	589520	Well, how do you feel?
589520	592520	Well, I think I'm into dudes now.
592520	597520	The problem is your attitude. If you won't act like a man, how can you think like a man?
597520	601520	And if you won't think like a man, how can you feel like a man?
601520	603520	I don't want to feel like a man.
603520	606520	Why can't you just be a man?
606520	614520	Be a man. Be a man.
614520	616520	This looks good.
616520	619520	If I don't move my arms.
619520	622520	Is there a way to smash my ribs in?
622520	626520	I'll smash him in, I'll smash the shit out of him.
626520	631520	These shoes are cute and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.
631520	633520	Would you fuck me?
633520	644520	I wouldn't.
644520	646520	Why won't you fuck me?
646520	649520	I don't want to.
649520	651520	Why not?
651520	654520	It makes me feel like a man.
654520	657520	You are a man.
657520	663520	Well, I don't want to be.
663520	666520	What does it even mean to feel like a man?
666520	668520	Well, don't you feel like a woman?
668520	671520	No, I feel like myself.
671520	675520	Well, exactly.
675520	678520	Are you sure you're not just gay?
678520	680520	Yeah, that's what it is. I'm extremely gay.
680520	684520	Alright, well, I'm leaving. Bye.
740520	764520	Thanks for watching!
764520	766520	Thanks for watching!
794520	796520	Thanks for watching!
824520	850520	Is this even real?
