1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
When I first went on YouTube around 10 years ago, it was a place where intelligent and

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,880
educated skeptics, gravity, freethinkers, my cock, and radicals could come together

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,040
to berate hucksters and idiots.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,520
Sadly, this golden age has ended, and according to Thunderf00t, the atheist community's self-appointed

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,280
leader and champion, it's all the fault of a bunch of uppity women, black people, and

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,680
queers, who came along and ruined everything by demanding that we respect their feelings.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
This is wrong. Let's talk about why.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,480
I've looked in the grass. I've looked in the bush. I'm not finding Jesus anywhere.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,520
For viewers who are new around here, I'll provide a little backstory.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
The New Atheist movement began with the publication of The End of Faith in 2004.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,240
The movement was centered around four white men, each of whom once had something interesting to

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,800
say, and one of whom once invited me back to his hotel room for a cup of coffee before he f***ed.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,920
The YouTube branch of the movement was mainly a bunch of nerdy, socially awkward white men,

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,200
like your humble narrator. Our intellects and libidos flourished in the new digital medium.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,720
YouTube was a venue for isolated people to connect with each other,

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,920
carrying on discussions and complaining about things that we couldn't complain about elsewhere.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:35,600
Since then, many of the community's central figures have stopped making videos,

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,320
or have moved on to other subjects. So what happened? How come new atheism has faded away?

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Now I want you to keep in mind that I'm an aging pseudo-intellectual twink with an alcohol problem,

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,040
and I'm not claiming to be smarter than Thunderf00t, but sometimes the simplest

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,880
answer is the best. New atheism was a trend, and like all trends, it died out.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,280
As a topic of discussion, atheism is inherently limited. There are only so many different ways

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,240
you can say that God does not exist. I think when it comes down to it, people just got bored.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,960
Meanwhile, new social movements have arrived, drawing attention to a different set of problems.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,240
Some YouTubers have adapted to the new moral climate, while others have doubled down on fear

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,400
and hatred and madness and darkness. I want to argue that the reactionary approach of Thunderf00t

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,440
and others to feminism is fucking shit. But first I want to clear something up. I am not a social

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,600
justice warrior, and just an independent free-thinking skeptic who looks at the evidence

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,960
and reaches my own conclusions. I actually think there's a lot of really bad stuff going on in

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,440
social justice circles lately, from substituting weird alienating jargon for plain English,

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,120
to celebrating activists' ugliest impulses, to crusading against trivial or nonsensical offenses,

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,160
to single-mindedly focusing on some pet social justice issue at the expense of all nuance.

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,360
But the truth is that you can find people behaving terribly within any movement. On both sides of

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,960
this debate, and every other, there will be those who act and think in petty, selfish,

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,960
and small-minded ways. That's human nature, not feminism. The intellectually responsible

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,200
thing to do is try to filter all the nonsense out, and address only the strongest arguments

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,560
that each side has to offer. But that's boring as hell, so fuck it.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,600
Thunderf00t and his allies claim to be knights of reason, championing objectivity, evidence,

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,920
and difficult truths against a horde of oversensitive crybabies, who take offense

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,500
and retreat to their safe spaces at the slightest whiff of opposition. But ironically, the Thunder

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,960
feet of the world are often just as eager to take offense. Feminist Rebecca Watson begins

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,200
one of her videos like this. Hello, YouTube. It's been a while. I've missed you, and I'm

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,040
guessing that you've missed me too, because I've heard that if a male atheist on YouTube

44
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,960
goes too long without calling a woman a cunt, his balls will actually shrivel up and then

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,760
tuck up inside of him, forming what some call a man-gina. And while this is not the height

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,160
of comedy, take a look at how Thunderf00t responds. And that was it. That's how the

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,960
face of feminism in atheism thinks it's the best way to start a charity fundraiser, using

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,040
this passive-aggressive victim routine to spit poison at the entire male atheist audience.

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,720
He's essentially crying sexism. Jesus, Thunderf00t, can't you take a joke? Why are these anti-feminists

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,640
so oversensitive? And this bit of offense-taking is the flimsy beginning of a video with the

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,400
absurdly overstated thesis that feminism poisons everything. This kind of exaggeration was

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,120
sort of cute when Hitchens did it, but it certainly lost its charm. Really? Feminism

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,120
poisons everything? Did it poison my coffee? How can such a pretty wife make such bad coffee?

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,280
I heard that. In another video, Thunderf00t complains that atheist conferences are filled

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,280
with politically correct whiners. I am cisgender, male, poly, and disabled, so I've got a lot

56
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,280
of privilege on this panel. Some of the issues facing the LGBT, like, past marriage, definitely

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,520
bi-phobia and pan-phobia. I'm a trans woman, an atheist, I'm poly, and I'm gay. Honestly,

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,640
Thunderf00t, I don't like listening to this shit any more than you do. I don't think anyone

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,600
likes listening to it. Not even a gay, bi, gender, polysexual wolfkin. But not all anger

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,720
is righteous, and some feelings are best kept to yourself. Your whole argument is that

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,440
social justice warriors have ruined atheism by talking about gender issues, which you

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,680
say you don't care about. Is that why you've made 54 videos about how much you fucking

63
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,680
hate feminism? God damn it. This is just not the behavior of a man who doesn't care about

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,840
gender politics. Compare Thunderf00t's channel, which for the last couple years has been mostly

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,280
about feminism, with a little science thrown in here and there, with Rebecca Watson, who

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,580
vlogs mostly about science. Even when Thunderf00t chooses the right opponents, he still gets

67
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,220
it wrong. I'm not a fan of Anita Sarkeesian myself. I think she's a single-minded moral

68
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
fanatic with a one-note worldview.

69
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,780
Pornographic adolescent boy fantasies.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Ultimate misogynistic male fantasy.

71
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,460
A choose-your-own-patriarchal-adventure porno fantasy.

72
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
Adolescent male power fantasy.

73
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,140
Most of her videos involve banal feminism 101-type critiques of video games, an art

74
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,020
form that she basically disdains, and seems to view only as an opportunity for her to

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,540
exercise a repetitive, tiresome style of generic, feminist nitpicking. And yet the

76
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,820
central argument for videos is that video games often contain lazy and sexist writing

77
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,340
that excludes women from an important area of cultural life. This seems to me obviously

78
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,860
true, regardless of Anita's tedious treatment of the subject, or her questionable crowdfunding

79
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,500
practices. But look how Thunderf00t responds when faced with Anita's totally obvious and

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,980
banal evidence that men who make video games like to look at women's butts.

81
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,620
Most women know that they have wider hips than men, because that's where the babies

82
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,100
come out. You know, it's that whole birthing canal thing.

83
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,500
His response is essentially to say, nuh-uh, this is just a scientific objective representation

84
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,180
of female anatomy. Men don't like to look at women's butts. Resident Evil 2 is just

85
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,260
a scientific documentary about the skeletal anatomy of a female woman.

86
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,740
And here I was about to accuse Anita of stating the obvious, as if we need a pop-culture critic

87
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,780
to reveal the shocking evidence that men like looking at lady butts.

88
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,940
The problem with Thunderf00t's approach to this topic is he objects to the worst arguments

89
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,460
of two or three feminists on the internet, and then concludes that all feminism poisons

90
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,060
everything. He doesn't respond to or even seem to be aware of the body of scientific

91
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,460
evidence suggesting that misogyny is real, that workplace discrimination hurts women,

92
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,660
and that a cultural hostile to women is particularly bad in STEM fields. You know, like the field

93
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,700
that he's in. He doesn't seem to be at all worried about how reactionary his views are

94
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,060
and the company they put him in. There's a huge surge of right-wing commentary on YouTube

95
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,900
right now, and Thunderf00t's ideas fit right in with the rest of them, even with people

96
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,140
like this tedious antelope, Slenderman, the Dragonborn, a gay Nazi, the Tin Man, a stilted

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,980
vampire, a Sumerian monarch, a fake university, and the queen of the internet. It seems Thunderf00t's

98
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,180
already getting chummy with some of them, like in this video where he, the amazing atheist,

99
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,420
and Scotty hold a Skype conference call so they can all critique Rebecca Watson's views

100
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:50,680
and physical appearance for 25 minutes. Does anyone else think these guys seem weirdly

101
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:02,140
intimidated by women who don't agree with them? This sort of thing makes you suspect

102
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,700
that this virulent anti-feminism isn't a serious political position at all. It seems more like

103
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:19,040
a web of excuses to cling to ugly and discredited behavior. It's too bad, since I think that

104
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,900
feminism would really benefit from engaging with some earnest and serious criticism. Unfortunately,

105
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,620
the brand of anti-feminism represented by Thunderf00t and most of his YouTube allies

106
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,620
only makes it more difficult to start a real conversation. And a prominent scientist in

107
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,540
the STEM field using his influence and audience to levy tirades against all feminists. Well,

108
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:46,340
it's just kinda shitty. If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe. You can also
