0	9600	When I first went on YouTube around 10 years ago, it was a place where intelligent and
9600	16880	educated skeptics, gravity, freethinkers, my cock, and radicals could come together
16880	19040	to berate hucksters and idiots.
19040	24520	Sadly, this golden age has ended, and according to Thunderf00t, the atheist community's self-appointed
24520	29280	leader and champion, it's all the fault of a bunch of uppity women, black people, and
29360	33680	queers, who came along and ruined everything by demanding that we respect their feelings.
33680	37040	This is wrong. Let's talk about why.
37040	43480	I've looked in the grass. I've looked in the bush. I'm not finding Jesus anywhere.
43480	47520	For viewers who are new around here, I'll provide a little backstory.
47520	52520	The New Atheist movement began with the publication of The End of Faith in 2004.
52520	57240	The movement was centered around four white men, each of whom once had something interesting to
57280	61800	say, and one of whom once invited me back to his hotel room for a cup of coffee before he f***ed.
61800	66920	The YouTube branch of the movement was mainly a bunch of nerdy, socially awkward white men,
66920	72200	like your humble narrator. Our intellects and libidos flourished in the new digital medium.
72200	75720	YouTube was a venue for isolated people to connect with each other,
75720	79920	carrying on discussions and complaining about things that we couldn't complain about elsewhere.
79920	95600	Since then, many of the community's central figures have stopped making videos,
95600	101320	or have moved on to other subjects. So what happened? How come new atheism has faded away?
101320	108320	Now I want you to keep in mind that I'm an aging pseudo-intellectual twink with an alcohol problem,
108360	112040	and I'm not claiming to be smarter than Thunderf00t, but sometimes the simplest
112040	116880	answer is the best. New atheism was a trend, and like all trends, it died out.
116880	122280	As a topic of discussion, atheism is inherently limited. There are only so many different ways
122280	127240	you can say that God does not exist. I think when it comes down to it, people just got bored.
127240	134960	Meanwhile, new social movements have arrived, drawing attention to a different set of problems.
134960	140240	Some YouTubers have adapted to the new moral climate, while others have doubled down on fear
140240	145400	and hatred and madness and darkness. I want to argue that the reactionary approach of Thunderf00t
145400	151440	and others to feminism is fucking shit. But first I want to clear something up. I am not a social
151440	154600	justice warrior, and just an independent free-thinking skeptic who looks at the evidence
154600	159960	and reaches my own conclusions. I actually think there's a lot of really bad stuff going on in
159960	164440	social justice circles lately, from substituting weird alienating jargon for plain English,
164440	170120	to celebrating activists' ugliest impulses, to crusading against trivial or nonsensical offenses,
170120	175160	to single-mindedly focusing on some pet social justice issue at the expense of all nuance.
175160	180360	But the truth is that you can find people behaving terribly within any movement. On both sides of
180360	183960	this debate, and every other, there will be those who act and think in petty, selfish,
183960	188960	and small-minded ways. That's human nature, not feminism. The intellectually responsible
188960	193200	thing to do is try to filter all the nonsense out, and address only the strongest arguments
193200	196560	that each side has to offer. But that's boring as hell, so fuck it.
196560	203600	Thunderf00t and his allies claim to be knights of reason, championing objectivity, evidence,
203600	207920	and difficult truths against a horde of oversensitive crybabies, who take offense
207920	212500	and retreat to their safe spaces at the slightest whiff of opposition. But ironically, the Thunder
212500	216960	feet of the world are often just as eager to take offense. Feminist Rebecca Watson begins
216960	222200	one of her videos like this. Hello, YouTube. It's been a while. I've missed you, and I'm
222200	226040	guessing that you've missed me too, because I've heard that if a male atheist on YouTube
226040	230960	goes too long without calling a woman a cunt, his balls will actually shrivel up and then
230960	235760	tuck up inside of him, forming what some call a man-gina. And while this is not the height
235760	241160	of comedy, take a look at how Thunderf00t responds. And that was it. That's how the
241160	246960	face of feminism in atheism thinks it's the best way to start a charity fundraiser, using
247040	254040	this passive-aggressive victim routine to spit poison at the entire male atheist audience.
254680	260720	He's essentially crying sexism. Jesus, Thunderf00t, can't you take a joke? Why are these anti-feminists
260720	265640	so oversensitive? And this bit of offense-taking is the flimsy beginning of a video with the
265640	271400	absurdly overstated thesis that feminism poisons everything. This kind of exaggeration was
271400	277120	sort of cute when Hitchens did it, but it certainly lost its charm. Really? Feminism
277120	284120	poisons everything? Did it poison my coffee? How can such a pretty wife make such bad coffee?
285120	290280	I heard that. In another video, Thunderf00t complains that atheist conferences are filled
290280	297280	with politically correct whiners. I am cisgender, male, poly, and disabled, so I've got a lot
298280	305280	of privilege on this panel. Some of the issues facing the LGBT, like, past marriage, definitely
307520	314520	bi-phobia and pan-phobia. I'm a trans woman, an atheist, I'm poly, and I'm gay. Honestly,
316400	320640	Thunderf00t, I don't like listening to this shit any more than you do. I don't think anyone
320640	325600	likes listening to it. Not even a gay, bi, gender, polysexual wolfkin. But not all anger
325600	329720	is righteous, and some feelings are best kept to yourself. Your whole argument is that
329720	334440	social justice warriors have ruined atheism by talking about gender issues, which you
334440	338680	say you don't care about. Is that why you've made 54 videos about how much you fucking
338680	342680	hate feminism? God damn it. This is just not the behavior of a man who doesn't care about
342680	346840	gender politics. Compare Thunderf00t's channel, which for the last couple years has been mostly
346840	351280	about feminism, with a little science thrown in here and there, with Rebecca Watson, who
351280	355580	vlogs mostly about science. Even when Thunderf00t chooses the right opponents, he still gets
355580	360220	it wrong. I'm not a fan of Anita Sarkeesian myself. I think she's a single-minded moral
360220	362220	fanatic with a one-note worldview.
362220	364780	Pornographic adolescent boy fantasies.
364780	367580	Ultimate misogynistic male fantasy.
367580	370460	A choose-your-own-patriarchal-adventure porno fantasy.
370460	372460	Adolescent male power fantasy.
372460	377140	Most of her videos involve banal feminism 101-type critiques of video games, an art
377140	381020	form that she basically disdains, and seems to view only as an opportunity for her to
381020	385540	exercise a repetitive, tiresome style of generic, feminist nitpicking. And yet the
385540	389820	central argument for videos is that video games often contain lazy and sexist writing
389820	394340	that excludes women from an important area of cultural life. This seems to me obviously
394340	398860	true, regardless of Anita's tedious treatment of the subject, or her questionable crowdfunding
398860	403500	practices. But look how Thunderf00t responds when faced with Anita's totally obvious and
403500	408980	banal evidence that men who make video games like to look at women's butts.
408980	415620	Most women know that they have wider hips than men, because that's where the babies
415620	419100	come out. You know, it's that whole birthing canal thing.
419100	424500	His response is essentially to say, nuh-uh, this is just a scientific objective representation
424500	429180	of female anatomy. Men don't like to look at women's butts. Resident Evil 2 is just
429180	433260	a scientific documentary about the skeletal anatomy of a female woman.
433260	437740	And here I was about to accuse Anita of stating the obvious, as if we need a pop-culture critic
437780	440780	to reveal the shocking evidence that men like looking at lady butts.
461780	465940	The problem with Thunderf00t's approach to this topic is he objects to the worst arguments
466020	470460	of two or three feminists on the internet, and then concludes that all feminism poisons
470460	475060	everything. He doesn't respond to or even seem to be aware of the body of scientific
475060	479460	evidence suggesting that misogyny is real, that workplace discrimination hurts women,
479460	484660	and that a cultural hostile to women is particularly bad in STEM fields. You know, like the field
484660	489700	that he's in. He doesn't seem to be at all worried about how reactionary his views are
489700	494060	and the company they put him in. There's a huge surge of right-wing commentary on YouTube
494060	497900	right now, and Thunderf00t's ideas fit right in with the rest of them, even with people
497900	504140	like this tedious antelope, Slenderman, the Dragonborn, a gay Nazi, the Tin Man, a stilted
504140	509980	vampire, a Sumerian monarch, a fake university, and the queen of the internet. It seems Thunderf00t's
509980	514180	already getting chummy with some of them, like in this video where he, the amazing atheist,
514180	519420	and Scotty hold a Skype conference call so they can all critique Rebecca Watson's views
519420	530680	and physical appearance for 25 minutes. Does anyone else think these guys seem weirdly
530680	542140	intimidated by women who don't agree with them? This sort of thing makes you suspect
542140	546700	that this virulent anti-feminism isn't a serious political position at all. It seems more like
546700	559040	a web of excuses to cling to ugly and discredited behavior. It's too bad, since I think that
559040	563900	feminism would really benefit from engaging with some earnest and serious criticism. Unfortunately,
563900	567620	the brand of anti-feminism represented by Thunderf00t and most of his YouTube allies
567620	571620	only makes it more difficult to start a real conversation. And a prominent scientist in
571620	576540	the STEM field using his influence and audience to levy tirades against all feminists. Well,
576540	586340	it's just kinda shitty. If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe. You can also
