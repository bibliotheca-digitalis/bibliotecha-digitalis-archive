00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
When I first went on YouTube around 10 years ago, it was a place where intelligent and

00:09.600 --> 00:16.880
educated skeptics, gravity, freethinkers, my cock, and radicals could come together

00:16.880 --> 00:19.040
to berate hucksters and idiots.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.520
Sadly, this golden age has ended, and according to Thunderf00t, the atheist community's self-appointed

00:24.520 --> 00:29.280
leader and champion, it's all the fault of a bunch of uppity women, black people, and

00:29.360 --> 00:33.680
queers, who came along and ruined everything by demanding that we respect their feelings.

00:33.680 --> 00:37.040
This is wrong. Let's talk about why.

00:37.040 --> 00:43.480
I've looked in the grass. I've looked in the bush. I'm not finding Jesus anywhere.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.520
For viewers who are new around here, I'll provide a little backstory.

00:47.520 --> 00:52.520
The New Atheist movement began with the publication of The End of Faith in 2004.

00:52.520 --> 00:57.240
The movement was centered around four white men, each of whom once had something interesting to

00:57.280 --> 01:01.800
say, and one of whom once invited me back to his hotel room for a cup of coffee before he f***ed.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.920
The YouTube branch of the movement was mainly a bunch of nerdy, socially awkward white men,

01:06.920 --> 01:12.200
like your humble narrator. Our intellects and libidos flourished in the new digital medium.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.720
YouTube was a venue for isolated people to connect with each other,

01:15.720 --> 01:19.920
carrying on discussions and complaining about things that we couldn't complain about elsewhere.

01:19.920 --> 01:35.600
Since then, many of the community's central figures have stopped making videos,

01:35.600 --> 01:41.320
or have moved on to other subjects. So what happened? How come new atheism has faded away?

01:41.320 --> 01:48.320
Now I want you to keep in mind that I'm an aging pseudo-intellectual twink with an alcohol problem,

01:48.360 --> 01:52.040
and I'm not claiming to be smarter than Thunderf00t, but sometimes the simplest

01:52.040 --> 01:56.880
answer is the best. New atheism was a trend, and like all trends, it died out.

01:56.880 --> 02:02.280
As a topic of discussion, atheism is inherently limited. There are only so many different ways

02:02.280 --> 02:07.240
you can say that God does not exist. I think when it comes down to it, people just got bored.

02:07.240 --> 02:14.960
Meanwhile, new social movements have arrived, drawing attention to a different set of problems.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.240
Some YouTubers have adapted to the new moral climate, while others have doubled down on fear

02:20.240 --> 02:25.400
and hatred and madness and darkness. I want to argue that the reactionary approach of Thunderf00t

02:25.400 --> 02:31.440
and others to feminism is fucking shit. But first I want to clear something up. I am not a social

02:31.440 --> 02:34.600
justice warrior, and just an independent free-thinking skeptic who looks at the evidence

02:34.600 --> 02:39.960
and reaches my own conclusions. I actually think there's a lot of really bad stuff going on in

02:39.960 --> 02:44.440
social justice circles lately, from substituting weird alienating jargon for plain English,

02:44.440 --> 02:50.120
to celebrating activists' ugliest impulses, to crusading against trivial or nonsensical offenses,

02:50.120 --> 02:55.160
to single-mindedly focusing on some pet social justice issue at the expense of all nuance.

02:55.160 --> 03:00.360
But the truth is that you can find people behaving terribly within any movement. On both sides of

03:00.360 --> 03:03.960
this debate, and every other, there will be those who act and think in petty, selfish,

03:03.960 --> 03:08.960
and small-minded ways. That's human nature, not feminism. The intellectually responsible

03:08.960 --> 03:13.200
thing to do is try to filter all the nonsense out, and address only the strongest arguments

03:13.200 --> 03:16.560
that each side has to offer. But that's boring as hell, so fuck it.

03:16.560 --> 03:23.600
Thunderf00t and his allies claim to be knights of reason, championing objectivity, evidence,

03:23.600 --> 03:27.920
and difficult truths against a horde of oversensitive crybabies, who take offense

03:27.920 --> 03:32.500
and retreat to their safe spaces at the slightest whiff of opposition. But ironically, the Thunder

03:32.500 --> 03:36.960
feet of the world are often just as eager to take offense. Feminist Rebecca Watson begins

03:36.960 --> 03:42.200
one of her videos like this. Hello, YouTube. It's been a while. I've missed you, and I'm

03:42.200 --> 03:46.040
guessing that you've missed me too, because I've heard that if a male atheist on YouTube

03:46.040 --> 03:50.960
goes too long without calling a woman a cunt, his balls will actually shrivel up and then

03:50.960 --> 03:55.760
tuck up inside of him, forming what some call a man-gina. And while this is not the height

03:55.760 --> 04:01.160
of comedy, take a look at how Thunderf00t responds. And that was it. That's how the

04:01.160 --> 04:06.960
face of feminism in atheism thinks it's the best way to start a charity fundraiser, using

04:07.040 --> 04:14.040
this passive-aggressive victim routine to spit poison at the entire male atheist audience.

04:14.680 --> 04:20.720
He's essentially crying sexism. Jesus, Thunderf00t, can't you take a joke? Why are these anti-feminists

04:20.720 --> 04:25.640
so oversensitive? And this bit of offense-taking is the flimsy beginning of a video with the

04:25.640 --> 04:31.400
absurdly overstated thesis that feminism poisons everything. This kind of exaggeration was

04:31.400 --> 04:37.120
sort of cute when Hitchens did it, but it certainly lost its charm. Really? Feminism

04:37.120 --> 04:44.120
poisons everything? Did it poison my coffee? How can such a pretty wife make such bad coffee?

04:45.120 --> 04:50.280
I heard that. In another video, Thunderf00t complains that atheist conferences are filled

04:50.280 --> 04:57.280
with politically correct whiners. I am cisgender, male, poly, and disabled, so I've got a lot

04:58.280 --> 05:05.280
of privilege on this panel. Some of the issues facing the LGBT, like, past marriage, definitely

05:07.520 --> 05:14.520
bi-phobia and pan-phobia. I'm a trans woman, an atheist, I'm poly, and I'm gay. Honestly,

05:16.400 --> 05:20.640
Thunderf00t, I don't like listening to this shit any more than you do. I don't think anyone

05:20.640 --> 05:25.600
likes listening to it. Not even a gay, bi, gender, polysexual wolfkin. But not all anger

05:25.600 --> 05:29.720
is righteous, and some feelings are best kept to yourself. Your whole argument is that

05:29.720 --> 05:34.440
social justice warriors have ruined atheism by talking about gender issues, which you

05:34.440 --> 05:38.680
say you don't care about. Is that why you've made 54 videos about how much you fucking

05:38.680 --> 05:42.680
hate feminism? God damn it. This is just not the behavior of a man who doesn't care about

05:42.680 --> 05:46.840
gender politics. Compare Thunderf00t's channel, which for the last couple years has been mostly

05:46.840 --> 05:51.280
about feminism, with a little science thrown in here and there, with Rebecca Watson, who

05:51.280 --> 05:55.580
vlogs mostly about science. Even when Thunderf00t chooses the right opponents, he still gets

05:55.580 --> 06:00.220
it wrong. I'm not a fan of Anita Sarkeesian myself. I think she's a single-minded moral

06:00.220 --> 06:02.220
fanatic with a one-note worldview.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.780
Pornographic adolescent boy fantasies.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.580
Ultimate misogynistic male fantasy.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.460
A choose-your-own-patriarchal-adventure porno fantasy.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460
Adolescent male power fantasy.

06:12.460 --> 06:17.140
Most of her videos involve banal feminism 101-type critiques of video games, an art

06:17.140 --> 06:21.020
form that she basically disdains, and seems to view only as an opportunity for her to

06:21.020 --> 06:25.540
exercise a repetitive, tiresome style of generic, feminist nitpicking. And yet the

06:25.540 --> 06:29.820
central argument for videos is that video games often contain lazy and sexist writing

06:29.820 --> 06:34.340
that excludes women from an important area of cultural life. This seems to me obviously

06:34.340 --> 06:38.860
true, regardless of Anita's tedious treatment of the subject, or her questionable crowdfunding

06:38.860 --> 06:43.500
practices. But look how Thunderf00t responds when faced with Anita's totally obvious and

06:43.500 --> 06:48.980
banal evidence that men who make video games like to look at women's butts.

06:48.980 --> 06:55.620
Most women know that they have wider hips than men, because that's where the babies

06:55.620 --> 06:59.100
come out. You know, it's that whole birthing canal thing.

06:59.100 --> 07:04.500
His response is essentially to say, nuh-uh, this is just a scientific objective representation

07:04.500 --> 07:09.180
of female anatomy. Men don't like to look at women's butts. Resident Evil 2 is just

07:09.180 --> 07:13.260
a scientific documentary about the skeletal anatomy of a female woman.

07:13.260 --> 07:17.740
And here I was about to accuse Anita of stating the obvious, as if we need a pop-culture critic

07:17.780 --> 07:20.780
to reveal the shocking evidence that men like looking at lady butts.

07:41.780 --> 07:45.940
The problem with Thunderf00t's approach to this topic is he objects to the worst arguments

07:46.020 --> 07:50.460
of two or three feminists on the internet, and then concludes that all feminism poisons

07:50.460 --> 07:55.060
everything. He doesn't respond to or even seem to be aware of the body of scientific

07:55.060 --> 07:59.460
evidence suggesting that misogyny is real, that workplace discrimination hurts women,

07:59.460 --> 08:04.660
and that a cultural hostile to women is particularly bad in STEM fields. You know, like the field

08:04.660 --> 08:09.700
that he's in. He doesn't seem to be at all worried about how reactionary his views are

08:09.700 --> 08:14.060
and the company they put him in. There's a huge surge of right-wing commentary on YouTube

08:14.060 --> 08:17.900
right now, and Thunderf00t's ideas fit right in with the rest of them, even with people

08:17.900 --> 08:24.140
like this tedious antelope, Slenderman, the Dragonborn, a gay Nazi, the Tin Man, a stilted

08:24.140 --> 08:29.980
vampire, a Sumerian monarch, a fake university, and the queen of the internet. It seems Thunderf00t's

08:29.980 --> 08:34.180
already getting chummy with some of them, like in this video where he, the amazing atheist,

08:34.180 --> 08:39.420
and Scotty hold a Skype conference call so they can all critique Rebecca Watson's views

08:39.420 --> 08:50.680
and physical appearance for 25 minutes. Does anyone else think these guys seem weirdly

08:50.680 --> 09:02.140
intimidated by women who don't agree with them? This sort of thing makes you suspect

09:02.140 --> 09:06.700
that this virulent anti-feminism isn't a serious political position at all. It seems more like

09:06.700 --> 09:19.040
a web of excuses to cling to ugly and discredited behavior. It's too bad, since I think that

09:19.040 --> 09:23.900
feminism would really benefit from engaging with some earnest and serious criticism. Unfortunately,

09:23.900 --> 09:27.620
the brand of anti-feminism represented by Thunderf00t and most of his YouTube allies

09:27.620 --> 09:31.620
only makes it more difficult to start a real conversation. And a prominent scientist in

09:31.620 --> 09:36.540
the STEM field using his influence and audience to levy tirades against all feminists. Well,

09:36.540 --> 09:46.340
it's just kinda shitty. If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe. You can also
