0	8000	The internet is infested with hundreds of sites claiming that the 9-11 attacks were an inside job and that the official story is a lie.
8000	14000	Some talk show radio hosts, documentarians, and authors are singing a similar song.
14000	22000	A whole industry has evolved around the 9-11 truth movement and a startling number of people seem to be convinced by their claims.
22000	26000	But is there any substance to these accusations of conspiracy?
26000	30000	Some of these websites and documentaries appear to be well researched.
30000	36000	They appear to present a lot of evidence for the case that the generally accepted story about the 9-11 attacks is false.
36000	43000	But a closer examination of many of these claims reveals that most of them are misleading, if not outright dishonest.
43000	53000	In this video series, I will be examining many of the claims conspiracy theorists make about the 9-11 attacks and attempting to debunk as many as I can.
53000	61000	I believe that once the dishonesty, distortions, and misunderstandings are removed from the conspiracy theories, very little remains.
61000	65000	I hope that at the end of the series, you will come to understand my position.
65000	72000	Some of the claims I wish to address include the claims that Al-Qaeda would not or could not have carried out the attacks,
72000	77000	that fires could not have caused the two World Trade Center towers to collapse,
77000	84000	that bombs were planted in the towers and in Building 7, and that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon.
84000	90000	I don't know how many videos I'll end up making, but I would like to address all or most of the most common claims.
90000	97000	Now, why am I going to all this trouble? Why do I care? Am I working for the government?
97000	101000	No. I have a variety of reasons for doing these videos.
101000	106000	First of all, just like any honest person, I am interested in what is true.
106000	113000	An honest look at the facts surrounding this tragedy is the least we can do for the people whose lives were lost that day.
113000	120000	Second, I grew up in the Washington DC area. I was just under 13 years old in September 2001,
120000	124000	and classmates of mine lost their parents in the attack on the Pentagon.
124000	131000	And it kind of pisses me off that so many people have made a cynical hobby out of distorting the facts of their deaths.
131000	136000	And lastly, I think that mass misinformation is nearly always harmful.
136000	138000	As Noam Chomsky put it,
138000	149000	One of the major consequences of the 9-11 movement has been to draw enormous amounts of energy and effort away from activism directed to real and ongoing crimes of the state.
149000	157000	The public's fixation on the imaginary 9-11 conspiracy has distracted them from the many real crimes that our government has committed.
157000	163000	Remember, just because the US government was not behind 9-11 doesn't mean they didn't exploit it.
163000	168000	They did exploit it, and they did abuse their power in real and undeniable ways.
168000	174000	You can believe that Al Qaeda was behind 9-11 and still oppose the Iraq war.
174000	184000	Anti-war activism was the first political issue I got seriously involved in, and when I was about 16 years old I went to DC anti-war protests.
184000	189000	I always despised the Bush administration, and I have nothing good to say about them.
189000	195000	But the truth is that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that they organized the 9-11 attacks.
195000	201000	Focusing on false accusations based on shoddy evidence only serves to distract from the real issues,
201000	206000	and it makes critics of the Bush administration easy to characterize as a bunch of raving loons.
206000	211000	For these reasons, it is my goal to set as many people straight on the issue as I can.
211000	215000	From here on, I'll do my best to let the facts speak for themselves.
