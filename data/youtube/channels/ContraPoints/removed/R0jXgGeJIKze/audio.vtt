00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
The internet is infested with hundreds of sites claiming that the 9-11 attacks were an inside job and that the official story is a lie.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
Some talk show radio hosts, documentarians, and authors are singing a similar song.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
A whole industry has evolved around the 9-11 truth movement and a startling number of people seem to be convinced by their claims.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
But is there any substance to these accusations of conspiracy?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Some of these websites and documentaries appear to be well researched.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
They appear to present a lot of evidence for the case that the generally accepted story about the 9-11 attacks is false.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
But a closer examination of many of these claims reveals that most of them are misleading, if not outright dishonest.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
In this video series, I will be examining many of the claims conspiracy theorists make about the 9-11 attacks and attempting to debunk as many as I can.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
I believe that once the dishonesty, distortions, and misunderstandings are removed from the conspiracy theories, very little remains.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I hope that at the end of the series, you will come to understand my position.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Some of the claims I wish to address include the claims that Al-Qaeda would not or could not have carried out the attacks,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
that fires could not have caused the two World Trade Center towers to collapse,

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
that bombs were planted in the towers and in Building 7, and that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
I don't know how many videos I'll end up making, but I would like to address all or most of the most common claims.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
Now, why am I going to all this trouble? Why do I care? Am I working for the government?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
No. I have a variety of reasons for doing these videos.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
First of all, just like any honest person, I am interested in what is true.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
An honest look at the facts surrounding this tragedy is the least we can do for the people whose lives were lost that day.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
Second, I grew up in the Washington DC area. I was just under 13 years old in September 2001,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
and classmates of mine lost their parents in the attack on the Pentagon.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
And it kind of pisses me off that so many people have made a cynical hobby out of distorting the facts of their deaths.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
And lastly, I think that mass misinformation is nearly always harmful.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
As Noam Chomsky put it,

02:18.000 --> 02:29.000
One of the major consequences of the 9-11 movement has been to draw enormous amounts of energy and effort away from activism directed to real and ongoing crimes of the state.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
The public's fixation on the imaginary 9-11 conspiracy has distracted them from the many real crimes that our government has committed.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Remember, just because the US government was not behind 9-11 doesn't mean they didn't exploit it.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
They did exploit it, and they did abuse their power in real and undeniable ways.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
You can believe that Al Qaeda was behind 9-11 and still oppose the Iraq war.

02:54.000 --> 03:04.000
Anti-war activism was the first political issue I got seriously involved in, and when I was about 16 years old I went to DC anti-war protests.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I always despised the Bush administration, and I have nothing good to say about them.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
But the truth is that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that they organized the 9-11 attacks.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Focusing on false accusations based on shoddy evidence only serves to distract from the real issues,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and it makes critics of the Bush administration easy to characterize as a bunch of raving loons.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
For these reasons, it is my goal to set as many people straight on the issue as I can.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
From here on, I'll do my best to let the facts speak for themselves.
