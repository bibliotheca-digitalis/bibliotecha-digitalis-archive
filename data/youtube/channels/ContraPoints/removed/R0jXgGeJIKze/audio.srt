00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The internet is infested with hundreds of sites claiming that the 9-11 attacks were an inside job and that the official story is a lie.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Some talk show radio hosts, documentarians, and authors are singing a similar song.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A whole industry has evolved around the 9-11 truth movement and a startling number of people seem to be convinced by their claims.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But is there any substance to these accusations of conspiracy?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Some of these websites and documentaries appear to be well researched.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They appear to present a lot of evidence for the case that the generally accepted story about the 9-11 attacks is false.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But a closer examination of many of these claims reveals that most of them are misleading, if not outright dishonest.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this video series, I will be examining many of the claims conspiracy theorists make about the 9-11 attacks and attempting to debunk as many as I can.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I believe that once the dishonesty, distortions, and misunderstandings are removed from the conspiracy theories, very little remains.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I hope that at the end of the series, you will come to understand my position.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Some of the claims I wish to address include the claims that Al-Qaeda would not or could not have carried out the attacks,

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that fires could not have caused the two World Trade Center towers to collapse,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that bombs were planted in the towers and in Building 7, and that Flight 77 did not hit the Pentagon.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know how many videos I'll end up making, but I would like to address all or most of the most common claims.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now, why am I going to all this trouble? Why do I care? Am I working for the government?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No. I have a variety of reasons for doing these videos.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
First of all, just like any honest person, I am interested in what is true.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
An honest look at the facts surrounding this tragedy is the least we can do for the people whose lives were lost that day.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Second, I grew up in the Washington DC area. I was just under 13 years old in September 2001,

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and classmates of mine lost their parents in the attack on the Pentagon.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And it kind of pisses me off that so many people have made a cynical hobby out of distorting the facts of their deaths.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And lastly, I think that mass misinformation is nearly always harmful.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
As Noam Chomsky put it,

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
One of the major consequences of the 9-11 movement has been to draw enormous amounts of energy and effort away from activism directed to real and ongoing crimes of the state.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The public's fixation on the imaginary 9-11 conspiracy has distracted them from the many real crimes that our government has committed.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Remember, just because the US government was not behind 9-11 doesn't mean they didn't exploit it.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They did exploit it, and they did abuse their power in real and undeniable ways.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can believe that Al Qaeda was behind 9-11 and still oppose the Iraq war.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Anti-war activism was the first political issue I got seriously involved in, and when I was about 16 years old I went to DC anti-war protests.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I always despised the Bush administration, and I have nothing good to say about them.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But the truth is that there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that they organized the 9-11 attacks.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Focusing on false accusations based on shoddy evidence only serves to distract from the real issues,

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and it makes critics of the Bush administration easy to characterize as a bunch of raving loons.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
For these reasons, it is my goal to set as many people straight on the issue as I can.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
From here on, I'll do my best to let the facts speak for themselves.
