00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Welcome to ContraPoints. I'm your host, John Jane… Jackson. Whatever. It doesn't matter.

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,040
Tonight our guests are Sir Beatrix Bumbridge, prominent sadomasochist and 17th Marquis de

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,720
Baton Rouge, and Abigail Cockbane, feminist activist and author of You Can Come For Free

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,680
At Home, The Case Against Prostitution. Tonight, they'll be debating the question,

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,120
Is BDSM Feminist? Now, Sir Beatrix, you are a prominent kinkster, and according to your

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,320
FetLife profile, you live the lifestyle 24-7, and are into paddling, bondage, penis humiliation,

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,200
panty sniffing, CMNF, CFNM, and… ass worship. Indeed. Would you call yourself a feminist?

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Please explain.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, John, feminism is all about a woman's right to choose. And that means that if she

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,440
chooses to have her husband tie her legs to stride the dishwasher and pummel her backside

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,460
till it flushes with the fuchsia flair of a newborn's cheek, that's her right as

12
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,140
a woman, so long as she does so in a safe, sane, consensual way.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,080
I see. And Ms. Cockbane, what do you think of that?

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,620
Well, it's all good and fine to talk about choice. But don't we also have to talk about

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:23,060
the contexts in which our choices are made? In patriarchal, pornographic society, where

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,520
women are constantly pressured to submit to male dominance, is there really any meaningful

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,660
sense in which women can genuinely consent to sexual subjugation?

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,040
Well, Cockbane, I think it's not really your place to question whether an adult woman

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,000
knows what she wants. But the thing is, I don't care what you want. I don't care

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,260
what your girlfriend wants. If you want to have your little leather costume parties and

21
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,500
beat each other senseless, I don't care. Well, clearly you care a little bit.

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,300
Everything isn't all about you and your special little sexual whims. Do these submissive

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,100
women ever pause to wonder why they enjoy being dominated and abused? Do they think

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,500
they just came out of the womb with a desire to be tortured and humiliated by men? Or does

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,460
it ever occur to them that just maybe a lifetime of cultural glorification of female submission

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,780
has influenced their desires? Well, if you're such an expert psychoanalyst,

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,660
then why don't you explain why there are men who want to be dominated, and women who

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,980
want to be dominated by other women? Well, patriarchy affects everyone, and just

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,700
because you're a lesbian or a man doesn't mean you're not influenced by the same cultural

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,160
pressures and reproducing the same power dynamics. But every choice we make is influenced by

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,660
cultural pressure. I mean, if cultural pressure renders our choices illegitimate, then I suppose

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,460
all choice is an illusion, and we should just give up on the idea of freedom altogether.

33
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,740
Well, hold on a minute. Don't you think Ms. Cockbane has a point? Isn't it worth questioning

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,940
where our desires come from instead of just taking them as given?

35
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,340
Questioning, sure. We live in a dark world, and maybe that's why we have dark desires.

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,580
But society's problems can't be fixed in a lifetime, and we all have to live with the

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,060
desires we have. So if I choose, in full knowledge of the darkness, that I want to act out my

38
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,660
dark fantasies in a responsible way with consenting adults, then I don't see what basis the Abigail

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,740
Cockbains of the worlds have to scold me for my choice.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,820
Well, well, well. Choice and consent are not magic words that make everything feminist.

41
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,740
Anti-abolitionists once argued that slaves were happier as slaves, and there are sex-trafficking

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,860
victims today who are so internally oppressed that they believe they consented to their

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,840
own subjection. But that doesn't make it okay, it doesn't make it a real choice, and it certainly

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,980
doesn't make it feminist. What is this absurd equivocation between violent

45
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,380
coercion and vague cultural influences? Do you really not see the difference between

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,620
being locked in chains at gunpoint and simply wanting to do something because you saw it

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,620
in a movie? But when the thing you want to do is be tortured,

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,980
then no, you don't see much difference. Torture? Oh, this is good.

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,340
According to the International Council for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, beating,

50
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,700
shocking, stretching, submersing, and suffocating are among the most common methods of torture,

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,060
and it is not legal to consent to torture. Fuck this.

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,860
So the sexual practices you're advocating are not only illegal and immoral, but are

53
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,420
actually in violation of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

54
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:18,380
And Sir Beatrix, how do you respond to that? Sir Beatrix? Sir Beatrix, please remove the gimp mask.

55
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,660
I'm going to my happy place. My name is Lady Bumbridge.

56
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,780
Well, we'll give him a moment. To be fair, Ms. Cockbane, I do think your argument is a little

57
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,580
bit out of line here. Do you really not see the difference between involuntary torture

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,220
and consensual masochism done for the sake of pleasure?

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,580
Well, John, I just don't see what's pleasurable about it.

60
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,740
But some people do find it pleasurable. Sir Beatrix, are you ready? Could you please

61
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,500
comment on this? All right. Look, Cockbane,

62
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,860
your problem is you just have a naive idea about what pleasure and pain are. Since you

63
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,420
radical feminists are so good at deconstructing false binaries, why don't you have a go at the

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,500
pleasure-pain distinction? Well, it's just inconceivable to me that there could be anything

65
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,220
pleasurable about being whipped and bound and abused. Have you ever gone running? Ever heard

66
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,140
of a runner's high? What about very spicy food? You know, pain and pleasure are often mixed.

67
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,500
Sometimes the road to heaven leads through hell. I just don't see how that applies to sex. I just

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:23,980
can't imagine being turned on by the firm grip of master's hands around my thighs as he bites the

69
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,540
side of my neck, my back arching as the straps are tightened around my wrists and ankles, yes,

70
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:38,860
in a shiver up my spine as I anticipate the first drop of hot candle wax in my pert exposed breasts,

71
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,700
and the intense full-body shock that surges through me as his flogger cracks across my

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,020
innocent pale buttocks, awakening my inner goddess and dissolving me into a deliquescent

73
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:59,140
paradise of shuddering orgasms. No, I just don't see anything arousing about that. Okay. Well,

74
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,900
if I didn't know any better, I'd say at the very least you seem a little bit curious. Well,

75
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,540
so what if I am curious? There are plenty of victims whose sexual fantasies are shaped by

76
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,980
their own traumas, but that doesn't make it okay. Are you a victim of trauma? Hey, well no,

77
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,740
but here you go. Can you please try to be civil? Don't ask intrusive questions. I'm sorry,

78
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,580
I just resent the implication that sexual kinks are the result of trauma. Well,

79
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,620
it was still out of line. I'm just saying that it's a false and harmful misconception about kink

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,320
that you shouldn't be propagating on your show. All right. Well, fair enough. Anyway,

81
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,380
we're running out of time. Let me just say for the record that my kinks have nothing to do with

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,900
any past trauma. I'm really completely fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. I hate my

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,940
job. I got involved with kink in the most innocent possible way. You see, when I was a boy, my family

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,180
had a Japanese governess who used to dress me up in my sister's clothes. Every day when I came

85
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,020
home from school, she would pick out a new frilly dress for me, and she would brush my hair. I can

86
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,060
still remember the way the stockings felt as she unrolled them up my legs. Never had I known such

87
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:15,700
rapture. At least, until one day when father came home early. Oh no. Oh no. Honey, I'm home. What

88
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:29,740
is the meaning of this? Oh god. It's all rushing back, man. Oh no. I'm a sissy bitch. I'm a sissy

89
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:41,160
bitch. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Well, thank you both for coming on. Tonight,

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,240
we learned that on this stage we call the world, men, women, and the rest of us actors

91
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,400
are all just kinda fucked up. So, it's best not to think too much about these things,

92
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,240
because rational discourse leads nowhere and introspection only uncovers the terrible traumas

93
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,160
of your past which you wish you had remembered to forget. In fact, I suppose sometimes it's

94
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,960
better to just get drunk and leave a comment on a YouTube video. So, from the ContraPoint

95
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:17,640
studio here in Baltimore, I bid you all good night. Alright, whose hand is on my thigh?
