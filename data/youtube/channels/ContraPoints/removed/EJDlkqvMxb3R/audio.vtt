00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
Welcome to ContraPoints. I'm your host, John Jane… Jackson. Whatever. It doesn't matter.

00:14.240 --> 00:20.040
Tonight our guests are Sir Beatrix Bumbridge, prominent sadomasochist and 17th Marquis de

00:20.040 --> 00:25.720
Baton Rouge, and Abigail Cockbane, feminist activist and author of You Can Come For Free

00:25.720 --> 00:30.680
At Home, The Case Against Prostitution. Tonight, they'll be debating the question,

00:30.680 --> 00:36.120
Is BDSM Feminist? Now, Sir Beatrix, you are a prominent kinkster, and according to your

00:36.120 --> 00:43.320
FetLife profile, you live the lifestyle 24-7, and are into paddling, bondage, penis humiliation,

00:43.320 --> 00:52.200
panty sniffing, CMNF, CFNM, and… ass worship. Indeed. Would you call yourself a feminist?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
Please explain.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.960
Well, John, feminism is all about a woman's right to choose. And that means that if she

00:56.960 --> 01:01.440
chooses to have her husband tie her legs to stride the dishwasher and pummel her backside

01:01.440 --> 01:05.460
till it flushes with the fuchsia flair of a newborn's cheek, that's her right as

01:05.460 --> 01:10.140
a woman, so long as she does so in a safe, sane, consensual way.

01:10.140 --> 01:13.080
I see. And Ms. Cockbane, what do you think of that?

01:13.080 --> 01:17.620
Well, it's all good and fine to talk about choice. But don't we also have to talk about

01:17.620 --> 01:23.060
the contexts in which our choices are made? In patriarchal, pornographic society, where

01:23.060 --> 01:27.520
women are constantly pressured to submit to male dominance, is there really any meaningful

01:27.520 --> 01:31.660
sense in which women can genuinely consent to sexual subjugation?

01:31.660 --> 01:36.040
Well, Cockbane, I think it's not really your place to question whether an adult woman

01:36.040 --> 01:40.000
knows what she wants. But the thing is, I don't care what you want. I don't care

01:40.000 --> 01:44.260
what your girlfriend wants. If you want to have your little leather costume parties and

01:44.260 --> 01:48.500
beat each other senseless, I don't care. Well, clearly you care a little bit.

01:48.500 --> 01:52.300
Everything isn't all about you and your special little sexual whims. Do these submissive

01:52.300 --> 01:57.100
women ever pause to wonder why they enjoy being dominated and abused? Do they think

01:57.100 --> 02:01.500
they just came out of the womb with a desire to be tortured and humiliated by men? Or does

02:01.500 --> 02:07.460
it ever occur to them that just maybe a lifetime of cultural glorification of female submission

02:07.460 --> 02:10.780
has influenced their desires? Well, if you're such an expert psychoanalyst,

02:11.220 --> 02:14.660
then why don't you explain why there are men who want to be dominated, and women who

02:14.660 --> 02:18.980
want to be dominated by other women? Well, patriarchy affects everyone, and just

02:18.980 --> 02:22.700
because you're a lesbian or a man doesn't mean you're not influenced by the same cultural

02:22.700 --> 02:27.160
pressures and reproducing the same power dynamics. But every choice we make is influenced by

02:27.160 --> 02:31.660
cultural pressure. I mean, if cultural pressure renders our choices illegitimate, then I suppose

02:31.660 --> 02:35.460
all choice is an illusion, and we should just give up on the idea of freedom altogether.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.740
Well, hold on a minute. Don't you think Ms. Cockbane has a point? Isn't it worth questioning

02:39.740 --> 02:42.940
where our desires come from instead of just taking them as given?

02:42.940 --> 02:47.340
Questioning, sure. We live in a dark world, and maybe that's why we have dark desires.

02:47.340 --> 02:51.580
But society's problems can't be fixed in a lifetime, and we all have to live with the

02:51.580 --> 02:56.060
desires we have. So if I choose, in full knowledge of the darkness, that I want to act out my

02:56.060 --> 03:01.660
dark fantasies in a responsible way with consenting adults, then I don't see what basis the Abigail

03:01.660 --> 03:04.740
Cockbains of the worlds have to scold me for my choice.

03:04.740 --> 03:09.820
Well, well, well. Choice and consent are not magic words that make everything feminist.

03:09.820 --> 03:14.740
Anti-abolitionists once argued that slaves were happier as slaves, and there are sex-trafficking

03:14.740 --> 03:18.860
victims today who are so internally oppressed that they believe they consented to their

03:18.860 --> 03:23.840
own subjection. But that doesn't make it okay, it doesn't make it a real choice, and it certainly

03:23.840 --> 03:27.980
doesn't make it feminist. What is this absurd equivocation between violent

03:27.980 --> 03:32.380
coercion and vague cultural influences? Do you really not see the difference between

03:32.380 --> 03:36.620
being locked in chains at gunpoint and simply wanting to do something because you saw it

03:36.620 --> 03:39.620
in a movie? But when the thing you want to do is be tortured,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.980
then no, you don't see much difference. Torture? Oh, this is good.

03:41.980 --> 03:46.340
According to the International Council for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, beating,

03:46.340 --> 03:51.700
shocking, stretching, submersing, and suffocating are among the most common methods of torture,

03:51.700 --> 03:54.060
and it is not legal to consent to torture. Fuck this.

03:54.060 --> 03:57.860
So the sexual practices you're advocating are not only illegal and immoral, but are

03:57.860 --> 04:01.420
actually in violation of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

04:01.580 --> 04:18.380
And Sir Beatrix, how do you respond to that? Sir Beatrix? Sir Beatrix, please remove the gimp mask.

04:18.380 --> 04:23.660
I'm going to my happy place. My name is Lady Bumbridge.

04:23.660 --> 04:28.780
Well, we'll give him a moment. To be fair, Ms. Cockbane, I do think your argument is a little

04:28.780 --> 04:32.580
bit out of line here. Do you really not see the difference between involuntary torture

04:32.580 --> 04:35.220
and consensual masochism done for the sake of pleasure?

04:35.220 --> 04:38.580
Well, John, I just don't see what's pleasurable about it.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.740
But some people do find it pleasurable. Sir Beatrix, are you ready? Could you please

04:42.740 --> 04:46.500
comment on this? All right. Look, Cockbane,

04:46.500 --> 04:50.860
your problem is you just have a naive idea about what pleasure and pain are. Since you

04:50.860 --> 04:55.420
radical feminists are so good at deconstructing false binaries, why don't you have a go at the

04:55.420 --> 04:59.500
pleasure-pain distinction? Well, it's just inconceivable to me that there could be anything

04:59.500 --> 05:04.220
pleasurable about being whipped and bound and abused. Have you ever gone running? Ever heard

05:04.220 --> 05:09.140
of a runner's high? What about very spicy food? You know, pain and pleasure are often mixed.

05:09.140 --> 05:14.500
Sometimes the road to heaven leads through hell. I just don't see how that applies to sex. I just

05:14.500 --> 05:23.980
can't imagine being turned on by the firm grip of master's hands around my thighs as he bites the

05:24.020 --> 05:30.540
side of my neck, my back arching as the straps are tightened around my wrists and ankles, yes,

05:30.540 --> 05:38.860
in a shiver up my spine as I anticipate the first drop of hot candle wax in my pert exposed breasts,

05:38.860 --> 05:44.700
and the intense full-body shock that surges through me as his flogger cracks across my

05:44.700 --> 05:51.020
innocent pale buttocks, awakening my inner goddess and dissolving me into a deliquescent

05:51.260 --> 05:59.140
paradise of shuddering orgasms. No, I just don't see anything arousing about that. Okay. Well,

05:59.140 --> 06:03.900
if I didn't know any better, I'd say at the very least you seem a little bit curious. Well,

06:03.900 --> 06:08.540
so what if I am curious? There are plenty of victims whose sexual fantasies are shaped by

06:08.540 --> 06:12.980
their own traumas, but that doesn't make it okay. Are you a victim of trauma? Hey, well no,

06:12.980 --> 06:17.740
but here you go. Can you please try to be civil? Don't ask intrusive questions. I'm sorry,

06:17.780 --> 06:21.580
I just resent the implication that sexual kinks are the result of trauma. Well,

06:21.580 --> 06:25.620
it was still out of line. I'm just saying that it's a false and harmful misconception about kink

06:25.620 --> 06:29.320
that you shouldn't be propagating on your show. All right. Well, fair enough. Anyway,

06:29.320 --> 06:33.380
we're running out of time. Let me just say for the record that my kinks have nothing to do with

06:33.380 --> 06:39.900
any past trauma. I'm really completely fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. I hate my

06:39.900 --> 06:45.940
job. I got involved with kink in the most innocent possible way. You see, when I was a boy, my family

06:45.940 --> 06:51.180
had a Japanese governess who used to dress me up in my sister's clothes. Every day when I came

06:51.180 --> 06:57.020
home from school, she would pick out a new frilly dress for me, and she would brush my hair. I can

06:57.020 --> 07:03.060
still remember the way the stockings felt as she unrolled them up my legs. Never had I known such

07:03.060 --> 07:15.700
rapture. At least, until one day when father came home early. Oh no. Oh no. Honey, I'm home. What

07:15.700 --> 07:29.740
is the meaning of this? Oh god. It's all rushing back, man. Oh no. I'm a sissy bitch. I'm a sissy

07:29.740 --> 07:41.160
bitch. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Well, thank you both for coming on. Tonight,

07:41.800 --> 07:47.240
we learned that on this stage we call the world, men, women, and the rest of us actors

07:47.240 --> 07:52.400
are all just kinda fucked up. So, it's best not to think too much about these things,

07:52.400 --> 07:57.240
because rational discourse leads nowhere and introspection only uncovers the terrible traumas

07:57.240 --> 08:02.160
of your past which you wish you had remembered to forget. In fact, I suppose sometimes it's

08:02.160 --> 08:07.960
better to just get drunk and leave a comment on a YouTube video. So, from the ContraPoint

08:07.960 --> 08:17.640
studio here in Baltimore, I bid you all good night. Alright, whose hand is on my thigh?
