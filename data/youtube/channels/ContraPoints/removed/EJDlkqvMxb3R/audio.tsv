0	14240	Welcome to ContraPoints. I'm your host, John Jane… Jackson. Whatever. It doesn't matter.
14240	20040	Tonight our guests are Sir Beatrix Bumbridge, prominent sadomasochist and 17th Marquis de
20040	25720	Baton Rouge, and Abigail Cockbane, feminist activist and author of You Can Come For Free
25720	30680	At Home, The Case Against Prostitution. Tonight, they'll be debating the question,
30680	36120	Is BDSM Feminist? Now, Sir Beatrix, you are a prominent kinkster, and according to your
36120	43320	FetLife profile, you live the lifestyle 24-7, and are into paddling, bondage, penis humiliation,
43320	52200	panty sniffing, CMNF, CFNM, and… ass worship. Indeed. Would you call yourself a feminist?
52200	53200	Please explain.
53200	56960	Well, John, feminism is all about a woman's right to choose. And that means that if she
56960	61440	chooses to have her husband tie her legs to stride the dishwasher and pummel her backside
61440	65460	till it flushes with the fuchsia flair of a newborn's cheek, that's her right as
65460	70140	a woman, so long as she does so in a safe, sane, consensual way.
70140	73080	I see. And Ms. Cockbane, what do you think of that?
73080	77620	Well, it's all good and fine to talk about choice. But don't we also have to talk about
77620	83060	the contexts in which our choices are made? In patriarchal, pornographic society, where
83060	87520	women are constantly pressured to submit to male dominance, is there really any meaningful
87520	91660	sense in which women can genuinely consent to sexual subjugation?
91660	96040	Well, Cockbane, I think it's not really your place to question whether an adult woman
96040	100000	knows what she wants. But the thing is, I don't care what you want. I don't care
100000	104260	what your girlfriend wants. If you want to have your little leather costume parties and
104260	108500	beat each other senseless, I don't care. Well, clearly you care a little bit.
108500	112300	Everything isn't all about you and your special little sexual whims. Do these submissive
112300	117100	women ever pause to wonder why they enjoy being dominated and abused? Do they think
117100	121500	they just came out of the womb with a desire to be tortured and humiliated by men? Or does
121500	127460	it ever occur to them that just maybe a lifetime of cultural glorification of female submission
127460	130780	has influenced their desires? Well, if you're such an expert psychoanalyst,
131220	134660	then why don't you explain why there are men who want to be dominated, and women who
134660	138980	want to be dominated by other women? Well, patriarchy affects everyone, and just
138980	142700	because you're a lesbian or a man doesn't mean you're not influenced by the same cultural
142700	147160	pressures and reproducing the same power dynamics. But every choice we make is influenced by
147160	151660	cultural pressure. I mean, if cultural pressure renders our choices illegitimate, then I suppose
151660	155460	all choice is an illusion, and we should just give up on the idea of freedom altogether.
155460	159740	Well, hold on a minute. Don't you think Ms. Cockbane has a point? Isn't it worth questioning
159740	162940	where our desires come from instead of just taking them as given?
162940	167340	Questioning, sure. We live in a dark world, and maybe that's why we have dark desires.
167340	171580	But society's problems can't be fixed in a lifetime, and we all have to live with the
171580	176060	desires we have. So if I choose, in full knowledge of the darkness, that I want to act out my
176060	181660	dark fantasies in a responsible way with consenting adults, then I don't see what basis the Abigail
181660	184740	Cockbains of the worlds have to scold me for my choice.
184740	189820	Well, well, well. Choice and consent are not magic words that make everything feminist.
189820	194740	Anti-abolitionists once argued that slaves were happier as slaves, and there are sex-trafficking
194740	198860	victims today who are so internally oppressed that they believe they consented to their
198860	203840	own subjection. But that doesn't make it okay, it doesn't make it a real choice, and it certainly
203840	207980	doesn't make it feminist. What is this absurd equivocation between violent
207980	212380	coercion and vague cultural influences? Do you really not see the difference between
212380	216620	being locked in chains at gunpoint and simply wanting to do something because you saw it
216620	219620	in a movie? But when the thing you want to do is be tortured,
219620	221980	then no, you don't see much difference. Torture? Oh, this is good.
221980	226340	According to the International Council for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, beating,
226340	231700	shocking, stretching, submersing, and suffocating are among the most common methods of torture,
231700	234060	and it is not legal to consent to torture. Fuck this.
234060	237860	So the sexual practices you're advocating are not only illegal and immoral, but are
237860	241420	actually in violation of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.
241580	258380	And Sir Beatrix, how do you respond to that? Sir Beatrix? Sir Beatrix, please remove the gimp mask.
258380	263660	I'm going to my happy place. My name is Lady Bumbridge.
263660	268780	Well, we'll give him a moment. To be fair, Ms. Cockbane, I do think your argument is a little
268780	272580	bit out of line here. Do you really not see the difference between involuntary torture
272580	275220	and consensual masochism done for the sake of pleasure?
275220	278580	Well, John, I just don't see what's pleasurable about it.
278580	282740	But some people do find it pleasurable. Sir Beatrix, are you ready? Could you please
282740	286500	comment on this? All right. Look, Cockbane,
286500	290860	your problem is you just have a naive idea about what pleasure and pain are. Since you
290860	295420	radical feminists are so good at deconstructing false binaries, why don't you have a go at the
295420	299500	pleasure-pain distinction? Well, it's just inconceivable to me that there could be anything
299500	304220	pleasurable about being whipped and bound and abused. Have you ever gone running? Ever heard
304220	309140	of a runner's high? What about very spicy food? You know, pain and pleasure are often mixed.
309140	314500	Sometimes the road to heaven leads through hell. I just don't see how that applies to sex. I just
314500	323980	can't imagine being turned on by the firm grip of master's hands around my thighs as he bites the
324020	330540	side of my neck, my back arching as the straps are tightened around my wrists and ankles, yes,
330540	338860	in a shiver up my spine as I anticipate the first drop of hot candle wax in my pert exposed breasts,
338860	344700	and the intense full-body shock that surges through me as his flogger cracks across my
344700	351020	innocent pale buttocks, awakening my inner goddess and dissolving me into a deliquescent
351260	359140	paradise of shuddering orgasms. No, I just don't see anything arousing about that. Okay. Well,
359140	363900	if I didn't know any better, I'd say at the very least you seem a little bit curious. Well,
363900	368540	so what if I am curious? There are plenty of victims whose sexual fantasies are shaped by
368540	372980	their own traumas, but that doesn't make it okay. Are you a victim of trauma? Hey, well no,
372980	377740	but here you go. Can you please try to be civil? Don't ask intrusive questions. I'm sorry,
377780	381580	I just resent the implication that sexual kinks are the result of trauma. Well,
381580	385620	it was still out of line. I'm just saying that it's a false and harmful misconception about kink
385620	389320	that you shouldn't be propagating on your show. All right. Well, fair enough. Anyway,
389320	393380	we're running out of time. Let me just say for the record that my kinks have nothing to do with
393380	399900	any past trauma. I'm really completely fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. I hate my
399900	405940	job. I got involved with kink in the most innocent possible way. You see, when I was a boy, my family
405940	411180	had a Japanese governess who used to dress me up in my sister's clothes. Every day when I came
411180	417020	home from school, she would pick out a new frilly dress for me, and she would brush my hair. I can
417020	423060	still remember the way the stockings felt as she unrolled them up my legs. Never had I known such
423060	435700	rapture. At least, until one day when father came home early. Oh no. Oh no. Honey, I'm home. What
435700	449740	is the meaning of this? Oh god. It's all rushing back, man. Oh no. I'm a sissy bitch. I'm a sissy
449740	461160	bitch. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Well, thank you both for coming on. Tonight,
461800	467240	we learned that on this stage we call the world, men, women, and the rest of us actors
467240	472400	are all just kinda fucked up. So, it's best not to think too much about these things,
472400	477240	because rational discourse leads nowhere and introspection only uncovers the terrible traumas
477240	482160	of your past which you wish you had remembered to forget. In fact, I suppose sometimes it's
482160	487960	better to just get drunk and leave a comment on a YouTube video. So, from the ContraPoint
487960	497640	studio here in Baltimore, I bid you all good night. Alright, whose hand is on my thigh?
