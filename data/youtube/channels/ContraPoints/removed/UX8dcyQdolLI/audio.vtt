00:00.000 --> 00:07.980
You know, a lot of people are saying that Donald Trump is racist, a lot of people are

00:07.980 --> 00:08.980
thinking that.

00:08.980 --> 00:09.980
It's something I'm looking at.

00:09.980 --> 00:10.980
I'm looking at a lot of things.

00:10.980 --> 00:15.680
And some other people are saying that it's just the crooked liberal media trying to discredit

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
him.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.680
But is it?

00:17.680 --> 00:19.080
Let's find out!

00:19.080 --> 00:23.240
But first, a word from a genuine and very real Trump supporter.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.480
Hello there boys and girls, my name is Trump with a trans estoy.

00:27.480 --> 00:35.320
And I'm here to sing you a song about a little thing called love.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.000
This one goes out to Charlie!

00:44.000 --> 00:48.960
So if you googled Donald Trump racism, you get a bunch of articles from liberal media,

00:48.960 --> 00:50.760
sites like Slate and Huffington Post.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.360
These articles all mention the same evidence of Trump's racism.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.300
There's a series of allegations of racial discrimination in his casinos and hotels,

00:57.300 --> 01:01.220
his reluctance to distance himself from white supremacists, his conspiracy theorizing about

01:01.220 --> 01:05.760
Obama's nationality, his tendency to phrase things like a racist grandpa, his encouragement

01:05.760 --> 01:10.100
of violence toward minority protesters, and of course his persistent stereotyping of Jews

01:10.100 --> 01:13.980
and Blacks and Mexicans and Asians and Injuns.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.660
All this sketches a picture of a man who is happy to exploit racism for political gain.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.380
But if I'm going to convince people that Trump personally holds racist beliefs, I'm going

01:21.380 --> 01:25.380
to need to present the kind of rigorous evidence and logic demanded by internet rationalist

01:25.380 --> 01:27.980
skeptics with furry avatars or beards.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.540
Why do these guys all have beards?

01:29.540 --> 01:31.780
I guess they're trying to communicate a message.

01:31.780 --> 01:35.980
Like thanks to the testosterone lozenge in my rectum, my thicket of pubes is at least

01:35.980 --> 01:38.860
as robust as my face merkin.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.580
My face is nothing like that.

01:40.580 --> 01:43.940
It's smooth and pure.

01:43.940 --> 01:45.940
Like a boy's face.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.900
Like a doll's face.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.140
Actually let's not psychoanalyze this too much.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.740
I don't think any of us benefit from the internet poking around too much in our psyches.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.420
In fact, don't look at me.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.420
Now where was I?

01:58.420 --> 01:59.420
Right.

01:59.420 --> 02:03.060
Trying to prove that this corn silk tufted cheese puff of a man is racist.

02:03.060 --> 02:06.660
Unfortunately it's pretty hard to prove what someone's private feelings and beliefs are.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.420
Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in Trump's head.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.820
For all I know it's just a kind of frothy bubbling sound, or like a monkey howling,

02:13.820 --> 02:15.420
or crazy circus music.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.420
I don't know.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.820
I don't know what Trump does at night before he goes to sleep.

02:18.820 --> 02:22.140
Maybe he reads Dostoevsky and wonders what the hell he's doing with his life.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.540
More likely he just looks at pictures of his ex-wife.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.140
But this is all just speculation.

02:26.140 --> 02:29.620
Fortunately what really matters is not what he personally believes, but what he does and

02:29.620 --> 02:30.620
says.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.540
But in order to understand that, we have to consider it in the context of American politics

02:33.540 --> 02:34.540
and race relations.

02:34.540 --> 02:38.500
Now it's good to keep in mind that a hundred years ago America was so racist that, of the

02:38.500 --> 02:42.820
more than 200 anti-lynching bills introduced by Congress, not a single one ever passed

02:42.820 --> 02:43.820
the Senate.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.820
I bring this up not to suggest that things haven't changed at all, but as a reminder

02:46.820 --> 02:50.760
that terribly racist things were once justified using the same kinds of arguments that still

02:50.760 --> 02:52.960
appear in today's political discourse.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.920
Lynching apologists didn't usually say,

02:54.920 --> 02:59.360
I hate the blacks, let's kill them at random to keep them terrorized and in their place.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.000
They argued that lynching was a necessary measure to keep black criminality in check,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.960
and especially to protect white women from black sexual aggression.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.420
Though the latter idea is now pretty disreputable, politicians and pundits still invoke fear

03:10.420 --> 03:14.280
of a savage black or brown menace in order to persuade white people to support racist

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
violence.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.520
The strategy works because a lot of white Americans have a deep visceral fear of black

03:18.520 --> 03:19.940
people and black crime.

03:19.940 --> 03:23.700
This is why it's so easy to rationalize to a white audience racist murders or police

03:23.700 --> 03:25.060
violence against blacks.

03:25.060 --> 03:28.140
All you have to do is show a picture of a scary-looking black dude, and a lot of white

03:28.140 --> 03:29.420
people get triggered as shit.

03:29.420 --> 03:30.420
Oh my god!

03:30.420 --> 03:31.420
Oh Jesus!

03:31.420 --> 03:32.420
Wow, you scared us.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.420
Not because you're black.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.420
No, no, no.

03:34.420 --> 03:35.420
We're not racist.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.420
No, God, no.

03:36.420 --> 03:40.820
That's why in the aftermath of the murders of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown there

03:40.820 --> 03:44.060
was so much debate over the pictures of the victims displayed by the media.

03:44.060 --> 03:47.460
If you show a picture of a black man looking like a thug, a lot of white people immediately

03:47.460 --> 03:49.060
conclude that he deserves to die.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.820
Now I'm not saying that it's totally irrational to be afraid of the ghetto.

03:51.820 --> 03:54.620
I'm pretty sure everyone is afraid of the ghetto, even black people.

03:54.620 --> 03:59.180
I was once trying to sublet my Chicago apartment, and I was turned down by a black woman on

03:59.180 --> 04:03.460
the grounds that there were quote, too many black men standing around in this neighborhood.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.460
So it's not that it's wrong to be afraid of the ghetto, it's just that if you allow your

04:06.460 --> 04:09.980
fear to get out of control, or allow it to get too general, it can lead you to do and

04:09.980 --> 04:12.020
believe insane or irrational things.

04:12.020 --> 04:13.340
It's just like any other fear.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.900
Even a fear as innocent as arachnophobia can turn a person with no self-control into a

04:16.900 --> 04:17.900
raving maniac.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.900
Ah, fuck.

04:18.900 --> 04:19.900
Ah, shit.

04:19.900 --> 04:20.900
Ah, kill it.

04:20.900 --> 04:21.900
Ah, kill it.

04:21.900 --> 04:22.900
Kill it.

04:22.900 --> 04:23.900
Kill it.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.900
Kill it!

04:24.900 --> 04:28.860
Exploiting the race-based fears of white people to win votes is a long-standing American political

04:28.860 --> 04:30.960
tactic known as the Southern Strategy.

04:30.960 --> 04:35.500
When overt racist declarations became more disreputable in the 1960s, politicians found

04:35.500 --> 04:37.460
more subtle ways of employing the tactic.

04:37.460 --> 04:41.900
In an anonymous 1981 interview, Republican strategist Lee Atwater described the strategy

04:41.900 --> 04:43.180
in a roundabout way.

04:43.180 --> 04:45.180
You start out in 1954 by saying

04:46.180 --> 04:48.180
By 1968, you can't say

04:48.180 --> 04:49.180
That hurts you.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.180
Backfires.

04:50.180 --> 04:53.180
So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.

04:53.180 --> 04:56.540
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these

04:56.540 --> 05:00.500
things you're talking about are totally economic things, and a byproduct of them is that blacks

05:00.500 --> 05:01.700
get hurt worse than whites.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.820
And subconsciously, maybe that is part of it.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.460
I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded,

05:07.460 --> 05:09.940
that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or another.

05:09.940 --> 05:10.940
You follow me?

05:10.940 --> 05:14.220
Because obviously sitting around saying we want to cut this is much more abstract than

05:14.260 --> 05:16.660
even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than

05:17.660 --> 05:21.900
This kind of encrypted racism is sometimes called dog whistle politics, since it's abstract

05:21.900 --> 05:26.060
enough not to appear overtly racist, but has enough racist overtones to resonate with certain

05:26.060 --> 05:27.060
white voters.

05:27.060 --> 05:31.140
A classic example is the law and order rhetoric of Goldwater, Nixon, and Reagan, aimed at

05:31.140 --> 05:33.540
white fears of ghetto riots and crime.

05:33.540 --> 05:37.820
Reagan also conjured up images of Chicago welfare queens and Cadillacs, and strapping

05:37.820 --> 05:40.480
young bucks buying steaks with food stamps.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.960
The implication was that social programs enriched lazy blacks at the expense of hard-working

05:44.960 --> 05:45.960
whites.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.720
And of course, Sarah Palin's term, real America, which refers to white rural America, bears

05:49.720 --> 05:52.520
the implication that non-whites are not real Americans.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.760
The tactic is typically associated with Republicans, but don't think that Democrats are immune.

05:56.760 --> 06:02.040
Hillary Clinton once described black, I mean urban, youth gangs as super predators, while

06:02.040 --> 06:05.680
as Christopher Hitchens often argued, her shitty husband once reveled in the execution

06:05.680 --> 06:10.320
of a brain-damaged black man in order to resuscitate his dwindling 1992 campaign and portray him

06:10.360 --> 06:12.760
himself as tough on blacks, I mean crime.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.840
What I'm suggesting is that there's an uninterrupted history of ugly racism in American politics

06:16.840 --> 06:18.520
that continues to the present day.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.680
So, where does Trump fit into all this?

06:20.680 --> 06:24.640
Well, Trump's conspiracy theorizing about Obama's nationality and the use of phrases

06:24.640 --> 06:29.240
like the blacks and the Hispanics looks like classic dog whistling to me.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.840
Even his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, is designed only to resonate with whites,

06:33.840 --> 06:37.120
who are the only demographic that can believe that things aren't better now than they were

06:37.120 --> 06:38.440
several decades ago.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.480
These little things communicate to racist white people that Trump is one of them, while

06:41.480 --> 06:44.600
remaining subtle enough that the charge of racism can be plausibly denied.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.200
But more worrying are Trump's more overt signals.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.320
When he calls undocumented Mexican immigrants rapists, he's basically one step away from

06:51.320 --> 06:53.800
repeating the age-old technique of asking white people,

06:53.800 --> 06:57.800
How would you feel if your lily white daughter were raped by a gang of savage negroes, eh?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.160
I mean this isn't even dog whistle politics anymore.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.760
He straight up called them rapists.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.920
Now you might be thinking, but Mexican is a nationality, not a race, to which I respond

07:05.920 --> 07:09.360
that that's a totally pedantic objection, and that the kinds of fears that Trump's rhetoric

07:09.360 --> 07:11.520
appeals to don't make these fine distinctions.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.240
In a lot of ways, Trump's campaign is more racist than any major presidential candidates

07:15.240 --> 07:16.240
in recent history.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.480
When the KKK endorsed Ronald Reagan, Reagan wrote in response,

07:19.480 --> 07:23.360
Those of us in public life can only resent the use of our names by those who seek political

07:23.360 --> 07:26.200
recognition for the repugnant doctrines of hate they espouse.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.680
The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have

07:29.680 --> 07:33.640
no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
stood.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.760
With Trump's response to former Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement,

07:37.760 --> 07:41.400
Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?

07:41.400 --> 07:46.040
I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
supremacists.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.160
So, I don't know.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.320
Even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing

07:52.320 --> 07:56.840
you, would you just say, unequivocally, you condemn them and you don't want their support?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.520
Well, I have to look at the group.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.640
I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.400
You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
I'd have to look.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.120
But you may have groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.080
So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know.

08:10.080 --> 08:14.120
Okay, I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...

08:14.120 --> 08:16.240
I don't know any—honestly, I don't know David Duke.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.800
I don't believe I've ever met him.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.160
I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.160
Pretty goddamn weak.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.360
Now, Trump did disavow the KKK the following day, but only under a lot of pressure.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.880
By itself, this apparent reluctance could be interpreted as a fluke, but it happens

08:29.880 --> 08:30.880
again and again.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.240
When confronted with the news that two of his supporters had assaulted a homeless Hispanic

08:34.240 --> 08:35.920
man, Trump's response was...

08:35.920 --> 08:40.120
The people that are following are very passionate.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.520
They love this country.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.560
They want this country to be great again.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.560
And they are very passionate.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
I will say that.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.280
Yeah, so passionate that they assault minorities and homeless people.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.920
You know who else had passionate supporters?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.400
And then there's this.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.320
Get rid of all these heebie-jobbies they wear at TSA.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.040
I've seen them myself.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.960
We need the veterans back in there to take it.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.560
They fought for this country and defended it.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.560
They'll still do it.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.560
Thank you.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.480
You know, and we are looking at that, and we are looking at that.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.480
We're looking at a lot of things.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.480
It's something I'm looking at.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.080
I'm looking at a lot of things.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.280
Compare Trump's basically affirmative response to a racist supporter with John McCain's handling

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
of a similar situation.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.000
I gotta ask you a question.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.400
I do not believe in...

09:21.400 --> 09:23.520
I can't trust Obama.

09:23.520 --> 09:30.480
I have read about him, and he's not, he's not, he's a, he's an Arab.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.480
He is not...

09:31.480 --> 09:32.480
No.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.480
No.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.480
No, ma'am.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
No, ma'am.

09:35.480 --> 09:41.040
He's a, he's a, he's a decent family man, citizen that I just happen to have disagreements

09:41.040 --> 09:45.800
with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.800
He's not.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.800
Thank you.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.480
McCain shuts that shit down while Trump makes sure there's room for it to thrive.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.840
He's always winking and nudging at white nationalists.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.200
It's no wonder he's the stormfront candidate of choice, you know, except among the ones

09:57.200 --> 09:59.980
who believe that even Trump is a puppet of the Zionist agenda.

09:59.980 --> 10:03.760
My main point is that there's a vast reservoir of white racism in America for politicians

10:03.760 --> 10:07.400
to draw on for political gain, and it's such an effective strategy that it's hard for them

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
to avoid the temptation.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.920
But I think that the situation is getting even worse.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.200
After Obama's election, there was a surge of involvement in hate groups and right-wing

10:14.200 --> 10:18.520
militias, but this extreme fringe stuff is now starting to seep into mainstream politics,

10:18.520 --> 10:20.080
especially into Trump's campaign.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.320
Trump has perhaps had his white identity politics worse when he gets nostalgic for

10:23.320 --> 10:28.280
the good old days of violence against protesters, and even encourages violence at his own events.

10:28.280 --> 10:34.320
If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
you?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
Seriously.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
Okay?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
Just knock the hell out.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.720
I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
I love the old days.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.200
You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?

10:46.200 --> 10:50.120
They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.480
That's true.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.960
Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.

10:55.960 --> 11:01.040
In the good old days, they'd rip him out of that seat so fast.

11:01.040 --> 11:06.240
But today, everybody's politically correct.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.040
Our country's going to hell with being politically correct.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.040
Going to hell.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.680
Now get him out of here, please.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
Get him out.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
Get him out.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
Get him out.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.480
Are you from Mexico?

11:18.480 --> 11:20.280
Are you from Mexico?

11:37.280 --> 11:40.120
Now to be clear, I don't think most of Trump's supporters are violent bigots.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.580
A lot of them are basically decent people, like Charlene, the cashier at my local 7-Eleven.

11:43.580 --> 11:47.820
You know, she's having a tough time financially and her son is addicted to meth, and she herself

11:47.820 --> 11:50.080
occasionally likes to get tweaked as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.420
Goddammit Trump, stop using racist nonsense to manipulate Charlene's brain.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.260
To return to the initial question, is Trump racist?

11:56.260 --> 12:00.420
Ultimately the most damning thing might be the fact that storm front neo-Nazis think that

12:00.420 --> 12:03.120
Trump is trying to appeal to them with racist rhetoric.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.280
If you're not being kinda racist, that's not a thing that neo-Nazis should think.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.020
So I guess, yeah, that does make him pretty racist, the goddamn orangey.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.980
I'm just about sick of his goddamn orangey-loving followers and-

12:12.980 --> 12:17.260
Ah geez. Is that racist? Oh no. I am the real racist.

12:17.260 --> 12:22.260
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

Speaking of Patreon, I'd like to say thank you to my first 15 Noble Patrons.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.480
Patreon doesn't charge you till the end of the month, so I'll be including you in the credits starting in August.

Ah, fuck.
