0	7980	You know, a lot of people are saying that Donald Trump is racist, a lot of people are
7980	8980	thinking that.
8980	9980	It's something I'm looking at.
9980	10980	I'm looking at a lot of things.
10980	15680	And some other people are saying that it's just the crooked liberal media trying to discredit
15680	16680	him.
16680	17680	But is it?
17680	19080	Let's find out!
19080	23240	But first, a word from a genuine and very real Trump supporter.
23240	27480	Hello there boys and girls, my name is Trump with a trans estoy.
27480	35320	And I'm here to sing you a song about a little thing called love.
35320	37000	This one goes out to Charlie!
44000	48960	So if you googled Donald Trump racism, you get a bunch of articles from liberal media,
48960	50760	sites like Slate and Huffington Post.
50760	53360	These articles all mention the same evidence of Trump's racism.
53360	57300	There's a series of allegations of racial discrimination in his casinos and hotels,
57300	61220	his reluctance to distance himself from white supremacists, his conspiracy theorizing about
61220	65760	Obama's nationality, his tendency to phrase things like a racist grandpa, his encouragement
65760	70100	of violence toward minority protesters, and of course his persistent stereotyping of Jews
70100	73980	and Blacks and Mexicans and Asians and Injuns.
73980	77660	All this sketches a picture of a man who is happy to exploit racism for political gain.
77660	81380	But if I'm going to convince people that Trump personally holds racist beliefs, I'm going
81380	85380	to need to present the kind of rigorous evidence and logic demanded by internet rationalist
85380	87980	skeptics with furry avatars or beards.
87980	89540	Why do these guys all have beards?
89540	91780	I guess they're trying to communicate a message.
91780	95980	Like thanks to the testosterone lozenge in my rectum, my thicket of pubes is at least
95980	98860	as robust as my face merkin.
98860	100580	My face is nothing like that.
100580	103940	It's smooth and pure.
103940	105940	Like a boy's face.
105940	108900	Like a doll's face.
108900	111140	Actually let's not psychoanalyze this too much.
111140	114740	I don't think any of us benefit from the internet poking around too much in our psyches.
115100	117420	In fact, don't look at me.
117420	118420	Now where was I?
118420	119420	Right.
119420	123060	Trying to prove that this corn silk tufted cheese puff of a man is racist.
123060	126660	Unfortunately it's pretty hard to prove what someone's private feelings and beliefs are.
126660	129420	Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in Trump's head.
129420	133820	For all I know it's just a kind of frothy bubbling sound, or like a monkey howling,
133820	135420	or crazy circus music.
135420	136420	I don't know.
136420	138820	I don't know what Trump does at night before he goes to sleep.
138820	142140	Maybe he reads Dostoevsky and wonders what the hell he's doing with his life.
142140	144540	More likely he just looks at pictures of his ex-wife.
144540	146140	But this is all just speculation.
146140	149620	Fortunately what really matters is not what he personally believes, but what he does and
149620	150620	says.
150620	153540	But in order to understand that, we have to consider it in the context of American politics
153540	154540	and race relations.
154540	158500	Now it's good to keep in mind that a hundred years ago America was so racist that, of the
158500	162820	more than 200 anti-lynching bills introduced by Congress, not a single one ever passed
162820	163820	the Senate.
163820	166820	I bring this up not to suggest that things haven't changed at all, but as a reminder
166820	170760	that terribly racist things were once justified using the same kinds of arguments that still
170760	172960	appear in today's political discourse.
172960	174920	Lynching apologists didn't usually say,
174920	179360	I hate the blacks, let's kill them at random to keep them terrorized and in their place.
179360	183000	They argued that lynching was a necessary measure to keep black criminality in check,
183000	185960	and especially to protect white women from black sexual aggression.
185960	190420	Though the latter idea is now pretty disreputable, politicians and pundits still invoke fear
190420	194280	of a savage black or brown menace in order to persuade white people to support racist
194280	195280	violence.
195280	198520	The strategy works because a lot of white Americans have a deep visceral fear of black
198520	199940	people and black crime.
199940	203700	This is why it's so easy to rationalize to a white audience racist murders or police
203700	205060	violence against blacks.
205060	208140	All you have to do is show a picture of a scary-looking black dude, and a lot of white
208140	209420	people get triggered as shit.
209420	210420	Oh my god!
210420	211420	Oh Jesus!
211420	212420	Wow, you scared us.
212420	213420	Not because you're black.
213420	214420	No, no, no.
214420	215420	We're not racist.
215420	216420	No, God, no.
216420	220820	That's why in the aftermath of the murders of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown there
220820	224060	was so much debate over the pictures of the victims displayed by the media.
224060	227460	If you show a picture of a black man looking like a thug, a lot of white people immediately
227460	229060	conclude that he deserves to die.
229180	231820	Now I'm not saying that it's totally irrational to be afraid of the ghetto.
231820	234620	I'm pretty sure everyone is afraid of the ghetto, even black people.
234620	239180	I was once trying to sublet my Chicago apartment, and I was turned down by a black woman on
239180	243460	the grounds that there were quote, too many black men standing around in this neighborhood.
243460	246460	So it's not that it's wrong to be afraid of the ghetto, it's just that if you allow your
246460	249980	fear to get out of control, or allow it to get too general, it can lead you to do and
249980	252020	believe insane or irrational things.
252020	253340	It's just like any other fear.
253340	256900	Even a fear as innocent as arachnophobia can turn a person with no self-control into a
256900	257900	raving maniac.
257900	258900	Ah, fuck.
258900	259900	Ah, shit.
259900	260900	Ah, kill it.
260900	261900	Ah, kill it.
261900	262900	Kill it.
262900	263900	Kill it.
263900	264900	Kill it!
264900	268860	Exploiting the race-based fears of white people to win votes is a long-standing American political
268860	270960	tactic known as the Southern Strategy.
270960	275500	When overt racist declarations became more disreputable in the 1960s, politicians found
275500	277460	more subtle ways of employing the tactic.
277460	281900	In an anonymous 1981 interview, Republican strategist Lee Atwater described the strategy
281900	283180	in a roundabout way.
283180	285180	You start out in 1954 by saying
286180	288180	By 1968, you can't say
288180	289180	That hurts you.
289180	290180	Backfires.
290180	293180	So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.
293180	296540	You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these
296540	300500	things you're talking about are totally economic things, and a byproduct of them is that blacks
300500	301700	get hurt worse than whites.
301700	303820	And subconsciously, maybe that is part of it.
303820	307460	I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded,
307460	309940	that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or another.
309940	310940	You follow me?
310940	314220	Because obviously sitting around saying we want to cut this is much more abstract than
314260	316660	even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than
317660	321900	This kind of encrypted racism is sometimes called dog whistle politics, since it's abstract
321900	326060	enough not to appear overtly racist, but has enough racist overtones to resonate with certain
326060	327060	white voters.
327060	331140	A classic example is the law and order rhetoric of Goldwater, Nixon, and Reagan, aimed at
331140	333540	white fears of ghetto riots and crime.
333540	337820	Reagan also conjured up images of Chicago welfare queens and Cadillacs, and strapping
337820	340480	young bucks buying steaks with food stamps.
340480	344960	The implication was that social programs enriched lazy blacks at the expense of hard-working
344960	345960	whites.
345960	349720	And of course, Sarah Palin's term, real America, which refers to white rural America, bears
349720	352520	the implication that non-whites are not real Americans.
352520	356760	The tactic is typically associated with Republicans, but don't think that Democrats are immune.
356760	362040	Hillary Clinton once described black, I mean urban, youth gangs as super predators, while
362040	365680	as Christopher Hitchens often argued, her shitty husband once reveled in the execution
365680	370320	of a brain-damaged black man in order to resuscitate his dwindling 1992 campaign and portray him
370360	372760	himself as tough on blacks, I mean crime.
372760	376840	What I'm suggesting is that there's an uninterrupted history of ugly racism in American politics
376840	378520	that continues to the present day.
378520	380680	So, where does Trump fit into all this?
380680	384640	Well, Trump's conspiracy theorizing about Obama's nationality and the use of phrases
384640	389240	like the blacks and the Hispanics looks like classic dog whistling to me.
389240	393840	Even his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, is designed only to resonate with whites,
393840	397120	who are the only demographic that can believe that things aren't better now than they were
397120	398440	several decades ago.
398440	401480	These little things communicate to racist white people that Trump is one of them, while
401480	404600	remaining subtle enough that the charge of racism can be plausibly denied.
404600	407200	But more worrying are Trump's more overt signals.
407200	411320	When he calls undocumented Mexican immigrants rapists, he's basically one step away from
411320	413800	repeating the age-old technique of asking white people,
413800	417800	How would you feel if your lily white daughter were raped by a gang of savage negroes, eh?
417800	420160	I mean this isn't even dog whistle politics anymore.
420160	421760	He straight up called them rapists.
421760	425920	Now you might be thinking, but Mexican is a nationality, not a race, to which I respond
425920	429360	that that's a totally pedantic objection, and that the kinds of fears that Trump's rhetoric
429360	431520	appeals to don't make these fine distinctions.
431520	435240	In a lot of ways, Trump's campaign is more racist than any major presidential candidates
435240	436240	in recent history.
436240	439480	When the KKK endorsed Ronald Reagan, Reagan wrote in response,
439480	443360	Those of us in public life can only resent the use of our names by those who seek political
443360	446200	recognition for the repugnant doctrines of hate they espouse.
446200	449680	The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have
449680	453640	no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always
453640	454640	stood.
454680	457760	With Trump's response to former Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement,
457760	461400	Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?
461400	466040	I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white
466040	467040	supremacists.
467040	468160	So, I don't know.
468160	472320	Even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing
472320	476840	you, would you just say, unequivocally, you condemn them and you don't want their support?
476840	478520	Well, I have to look at the group.
478520	480640	I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about.
480640	483400	You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about.
483400	484400	I'd have to look.
484720	488120	But you may have groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair.
488120	490080	So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know.
490080	494120	Okay, I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...
494120	496240	I don't know any—honestly, I don't know David Duke.
496240	497800	I don't believe I've ever met him.
497800	501160	I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.
501160	502160	Pretty goddamn weak.
502160	506360	Now, Trump did disavow the KKK the following day, but only under a lot of pressure.
506360	509880	By itself, this apparent reluctance could be interpreted as a fluke, but it happens
509880	510880	again and again.
510880	514240	When confronted with the news that two of his supporters had assaulted a homeless Hispanic
514240	515920	man, Trump's response was...
515920	520120	The people that are following are very passionate.
520120	521520	They love this country.
521520	523560	They want this country to be great again.
523560	524560	And they are very passionate.
524560	525560	I will say that.
525560	528280	Yeah, so passionate that they assault minorities and homeless people.
528280	529920	You know who else had passionate supporters?
532960	534400	And then there's this.
534400	537320	Get rid of all these heebie-jobbies they wear at TSA.
537320	539040	I've seen them myself.
539040	540960	We need the veterans back in there to take it.
540960	542560	They fought for this country and defended it.
542560	543560	They'll still do it.
543560	544560	Thank you.
544560	548480	You know, and we are looking at that, and we are looking at that.
548480	549480	We're looking at a lot of things.
549480	550480	It's something I'm looking at.
550480	552080	I'm looking at a lot of things.
552080	556280	Compare Trump's basically affirmative response to a racist supporter with John McCain's handling
556280	557280	of a similar situation.
557280	559000	I gotta ask you a question.
559000	561400	I do not believe in...
561400	563520	I can't trust Obama.
563520	570480	I have read about him, and he's not, he's not, he's a, he's an Arab.
570480	571480	He is not...
571480	572480	No.
572480	573480	No.
573480	574480	No, ma'am.
574480	575480	No, ma'am.
575480	581040	He's a, he's a, he's a decent family man, citizen that I just happen to have disagreements
581040	585800	with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about.
585800	586800	He's not.
586800	587800	Thank you.
587800	591480	McCain shuts that shit down while Trump makes sure there's room for it to thrive.
591480	593840	He's always winking and nudging at white nationalists.
593840	597200	It's no wonder he's the stormfront candidate of choice, you know, except among the ones
597200	599980	who believe that even Trump is a puppet of the Zionist agenda.
599980	603760	My main point is that there's a vast reservoir of white racism in America for politicians
603760	607400	to draw on for political gain, and it's such an effective strategy that it's hard for them
607400	608400	to avoid the temptation.
608400	610920	But I think that the situation is getting even worse.
610920	614200	After Obama's election, there was a surge of involvement in hate groups and right-wing
614200	618520	militias, but this extreme fringe stuff is now starting to seep into mainstream politics,
618520	620080	especially into Trump's campaign.
620080	623320	Trump has perhaps had his white identity politics worse when he gets nostalgic for
623320	628280	the good old days of violence against protesters, and even encourages violence at his own events.
628280	634320	If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would
634320	635320	you?
635320	636320	Seriously.
636320	637320	Okay?
637320	638320	Just knock the hell out.
638320	641720	I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.
641720	642720	I love the old days.
642720	646200	You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?
646200	650120	They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.
650120	652480	That's true.
652480	655960	Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.
655960	661040	In the good old days, they'd rip him out of that seat so fast.
661040	666240	But today, everybody's politically correct.
666240	671040	Our country's going to hell with being politically correct.
671040	672040	Going to hell.
672040	673680	Now get him out of here, please.
673680	674680	Get him out.
674680	675680	Get him out.
676480	677480	Get him out.
677480	678480	Are you from Mexico?
678480	680280	Are you from Mexico?
697280	700120	Now to be clear, I don't think most of Trump's supporters are violent bigots.
700120	703580	A lot of them are basically decent people, like Charlene, the cashier at my local 7-Eleven.
703580	707820	You know, she's having a tough time financially and her son is addicted to meth, and she herself
707820	710080	occasionally likes to get tweaked as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
710080	713420	Goddammit Trump, stop using racist nonsense to manipulate Charlene's brain.
713420	716260	To return to the initial question, is Trump racist?
716260	720420	Ultimately the most damning thing might be the fact that storm front neo-Nazis think that
720420	723120	Trump is trying to appeal to them with racist rhetoric.
723120	727280	If you're not being kinda racist, that's not a thing that neo-Nazis should think.
727280	730020	So I guess, yeah, that does make him pretty racist, the goddamn orangey.
730020	732980	I'm just about sick of his goddamn orangey-loving followers and-
732980	737260	Ah geez. Is that racist? Oh no. I am the real racist.
737260	742260	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
