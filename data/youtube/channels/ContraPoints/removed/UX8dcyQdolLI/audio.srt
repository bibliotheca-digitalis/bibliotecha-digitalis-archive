1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
You know, a lot of people are saying that Donald Trump is racist, a lot of people are

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,980
thinking that.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
It's something I'm looking at.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,980
I'm looking at a lot of things.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,680
And some other people are saying that it's just the crooked liberal media trying to discredit

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
him.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
But is it?

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,080
Let's find out!

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,240
But first, a word from a genuine and very real Trump supporter.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,480
Hello there boys and girls, my name is Trump with a trans estoy.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,320
And I'm here to sing you a song about a little thing called love.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,000
This one goes out to Charlie!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
So if you googled Donald Trump racism, you get a bunch of articles from liberal media,

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,760
sites like Slate and Huffington Post.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,360
These articles all mention the same evidence of Trump's racism.

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,300
There's a series of allegations of racial discrimination in his casinos and hotels,

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,220
his reluctance to distance himself from white supremacists, his conspiracy theorizing about

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,760
Obama's nationality, his tendency to phrase things like a racist grandpa, his encouragement

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,100
of violence toward minority protesters, and of course his persistent stereotyping of Jews

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,980
and Blacks and Mexicans and Asians and Injuns.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,660
All this sketches a picture of a man who is happy to exploit racism for political gain.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,380
But if I'm going to convince people that Trump personally holds racist beliefs, I'm going

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,380
to need to present the kind of rigorous evidence and logic demanded by internet rationalist

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,980
skeptics with furry avatars or beards.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,540
Why do these guys all have beards?

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,780
I guess they're trying to communicate a message.

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,980
Like thanks to the testosterone lozenge in my rectum, my thicket of pubes is at least

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,860
as robust as my face merkin.

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,580
My face is nothing like that.

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,940
It's smooth and pure.

31
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
Like a boy's face.

32
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Like a doll's face.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,140
Actually let's not psychoanalyze this too much.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,740
I don't think any of us benefit from the internet poking around too much in our psyches.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,420
In fact, don't look at me.

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,420
Now where was I?

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
Right.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,060
Trying to prove that this corn silk tufted cheese puff of a man is racist.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,660
Unfortunately it's pretty hard to prove what someone's private feelings and beliefs are.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,420
Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in Trump's head.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,820
For all I know it's just a kind of frothy bubbling sound, or like a monkey howling,

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,420
or crazy circus music.

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
I don't know.

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,820
I don't know what Trump does at night before he goes to sleep.

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,140
Maybe he reads Dostoevsky and wonders what the hell he's doing with his life.

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,540
More likely he just looks at pictures of his ex-wife.

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,140
But this is all just speculation.

48
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,620
Fortunately what really matters is not what he personally believes, but what he does and

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
says.

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,540
But in order to understand that, we have to consider it in the context of American politics

51
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
and race relations.

52
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,500
Now it's good to keep in mind that a hundred years ago America was so racist that, of the

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,820
more than 200 anti-lynching bills introduced by Congress, not a single one ever passed

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,820
the Senate.

55
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I bring this up not to suggest that things haven't changed at all, but as a reminder

56
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,760
that terribly racist things were once justified using the same kinds of arguments that still

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,960
appear in today's political discourse.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Lynching apologists didn't usually say,

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,360
I hate the blacks, let's kill them at random to keep them terrorized and in their place.

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,000
They argued that lynching was a necessary measure to keep black criminality in check,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,960
and especially to protect white women from black sexual aggression.

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,420
Though the latter idea is now pretty disreputable, politicians and pundits still invoke fear

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,280
of a savage black or brown menace in order to persuade white people to support racist

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
violence.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,520
The strategy works because a lot of white Americans have a deep visceral fear of black

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,940
people and black crime.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,700
This is why it's so easy to rationalize to a white audience racist murders or police

68
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,060
violence against blacks.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,140
All you have to do is show a picture of a scary-looking black dude, and a lot of white

70
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,420
people get triggered as shit.

71
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
Oh my god!

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
Oh Jesus!

73
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Wow, you scared us.

74
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
Not because you're black.

75
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
No, no, no.

76
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
We're not racist.

77
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
No, God, no.

78
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,820
That's why in the aftermath of the murders of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown there

79
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,060
was so much debate over the pictures of the victims displayed by the media.

80
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,460
If you show a picture of a black man looking like a thug, a lot of white people immediately

81
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,060
conclude that he deserves to die.

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,820
Now I'm not saying that it's totally irrational to be afraid of the ghetto.

83
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm pretty sure everyone is afraid of the ghetto, even black people.

84
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,180
I was once trying to sublet my Chicago apartment, and I was turned down by a black woman on

85
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,460
the grounds that there were quote, too many black men standing around in this neighborhood.

86
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,460
So it's not that it's wrong to be afraid of the ghetto, it's just that if you allow your

87
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,980
fear to get out of control, or allow it to get too general, it can lead you to do and

88
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,020
believe insane or irrational things.

89
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,340
It's just like any other fear.

90
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,900
Even a fear as innocent as arachnophobia can turn a person with no self-control into a

91
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
raving maniac.

92
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Ah, fuck.

93
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Ah, shit.

94
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Ah, kill it.

95
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Ah, kill it.

96
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Kill it.

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Kill it.

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Kill it!

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,860
Exploiting the race-based fears of white people to win votes is a long-standing American political

100
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,960
tactic known as the Southern Strategy.

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,500
When overt racist declarations became more disreputable in the 1960s, politicians found

102
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,460
more subtle ways of employing the tactic.

103
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,900
In an anonymous 1981 interview, Republican strategist Lee Atwater described the strategy

104
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,180
in a roundabout way.

105
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
You start out in 1954 by saying

106
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
By 1968, you can't say

107
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
That hurts you.

108
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
Backfires.

109
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,180
So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,540
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these

111
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,500
things you're talking about are totally economic things, and a byproduct of them is that blacks

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,700
get hurt worse than whites.

113
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,820
And subconsciously, maybe that is part of it.

114
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded,

115
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,940
that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or another.

116
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
You follow me?

117
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,220
Because obviously sitting around saying we want to cut this is much more abstract than

118
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,660
even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than

119
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,900
This kind of encrypted racism is sometimes called dog whistle politics, since it's abstract

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,060
enough not to appear overtly racist, but has enough racist overtones to resonate with certain

121
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
white voters.

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,140
A classic example is the law and order rhetoric of Goldwater, Nixon, and Reagan, aimed at

123
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,540
white fears of ghetto riots and crime.

124
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,820
Reagan also conjured up images of Chicago welfare queens and Cadillacs, and strapping

125
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,480
young bucks buying steaks with food stamps.

126
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,960
The implication was that social programs enriched lazy blacks at the expense of hard-working

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
whites.

128
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,720
And of course, Sarah Palin's term, real America, which refers to white rural America, bears

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
the implication that non-whites are not real Americans.

130
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,760
The tactic is typically associated with Republicans, but don't think that Democrats are immune.

131
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,040
Hillary Clinton once described black, I mean urban, youth gangs as super predators, while

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,680
as Christopher Hitchens often argued, her shitty husband once reveled in the execution

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,320
of a brain-damaged black man in order to resuscitate his dwindling 1992 campaign and portray him

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
himself as tough on blacks, I mean crime.

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,840
What I'm suggesting is that there's an uninterrupted history of ugly racism in American politics

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
that continues to the present day.

137
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,680
So, where does Trump fit into all this?

138
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Well, Trump's conspiracy theorizing about Obama's nationality and the use of phrases

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,240
like the blacks and the Hispanics looks like classic dog whistling to me.

140
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,840
Even his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, is designed only to resonate with whites,

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,120
who are the only demographic that can believe that things aren't better now than they were

142
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,440
several decades ago.

143
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,480
These little things communicate to racist white people that Trump is one of them, while

144
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,600
remaining subtle enough that the charge of racism can be plausibly denied.

145
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
But more worrying are Trump's more overt signals.

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,320
When he calls undocumented Mexican immigrants rapists, he's basically one step away from

147
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,800
repeating the age-old technique of asking white people,

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,800
How would you feel if your lily white daughter were raped by a gang of savage negroes, eh?

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,160
I mean this isn't even dog whistle politics anymore.

150
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,760
He straight up called them rapists.

151
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,920
Now you might be thinking, but Mexican is a nationality, not a race, to which I respond

152
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,360
that that's a totally pedantic objection, and that the kinds of fears that Trump's rhetoric

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
appeals to don't make these fine distinctions.

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
In a lot of ways, Trump's campaign is more racist than any major presidential candidates

155
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
in recent history.

156
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,480
When the KKK endorsed Ronald Reagan, Reagan wrote in response,

157
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,360
Those of us in public life can only resent the use of our names by those who seek political

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,200
recognition for the repugnant doctrines of hate they espouse.

159
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,680
The politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have

160
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
stood.

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,760
With Trump's response to former Grand Wizard David Duke's endorsement,

163
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,400
Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?

164
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,040
I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white

165
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
supremacists.

166
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
So, I don't know.

167
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,320
Even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing

168
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,840
you, would you just say, unequivocally, you condemn them and you don't want their support?

169
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,520
Well, I have to look at the group.

170
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,640
I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about.

171
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,400
You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about.

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I'd have to look.

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,120
But you may have groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair.

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,080
So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know.

175
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,120
Okay, I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't know any—honestly, I don't know David Duke.

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
I don't believe I've ever met him.

178
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.

179
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Pretty goddamn weak.

180
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,360
Now, Trump did disavow the KKK the following day, but only under a lot of pressure.

181
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,880
By itself, this apparent reluctance could be interpreted as a fluke, but it happens

182
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
again and again.

183
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,240
When confronted with the news that two of his supporters had assaulted a homeless Hispanic

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,920
man, Trump's response was...

185
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,120
The people that are following are very passionate.

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
They love this country.

187
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,560
They want this country to be great again.

188
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
And they are very passionate.

189
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I will say that.

190
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,280
Yeah, so passionate that they assault minorities and homeless people.

191
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,920
You know who else had passionate supporters?

192
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
And then there's this.

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,320
Get rid of all these heebie-jobbies they wear at TSA.

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,040
I've seen them myself.

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,960
We need the veterans back in there to take it.

196
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,560
They fought for this country and defended it.

197
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
They'll still do it.

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Thank you.

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,480
You know, and we are looking at that, and we are looking at that.

200
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
We're looking at a lot of things.

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
It's something I'm looking at.

202
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm looking at a lot of things.

203
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,280
Compare Trump's basically affirmative response to a racist supporter with John McCain's handling

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
of a similar situation.

205
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,000
I gotta ask you a question.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I do not believe in...

207
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,520
I can't trust Obama.

208
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:30,480
I have read about him, and he's not, he's not, he's a, he's an Arab.

209
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
He is not...

210
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
No.

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
No.

212
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
No, ma'am.

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
No, ma'am.

214
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,040
He's a, he's a, he's a decent family man, citizen that I just happen to have disagreements

215
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,800
with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about.

216
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
He's not.

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Thank you.

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,480
McCain shuts that shit down while Trump makes sure there's room for it to thrive.

219
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,840
He's always winking and nudging at white nationalists.

220
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,200
It's no wonder he's the stormfront candidate of choice, you know, except among the ones

221
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,980
who believe that even Trump is a puppet of the Zionist agenda.

222
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,760
My main point is that there's a vast reservoir of white racism in America for politicians

223
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,400
to draw on for political gain, and it's such an effective strategy that it's hard for them

224
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
to avoid the temptation.

225
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,920
But I think that the situation is getting even worse.

226
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,200
After Obama's election, there was a surge of involvement in hate groups and right-wing

227
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,520
militias, but this extreme fringe stuff is now starting to seep into mainstream politics,

228
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,080
especially into Trump's campaign.

229
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,320
Trump has perhaps had his white identity politics worse when he gets nostalgic for

230
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,280
the good old days of violence against protesters, and even encourages violence at his own events.

231
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,320
If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
you?

233
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Seriously.

234
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Okay?

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Just knock the hell out.

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,720
I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.

237
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
I love the old days.

238
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,200
You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?

239
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,120
They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.

240
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,480
That's true.

241
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,960
Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.

242
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,040
In the good old days, they'd rip him out of that seat so fast.

243
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,240
But today, everybody's politically correct.

244
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Our country's going to hell with being politically correct.

245
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Going to hell.

246
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Now get him out of here, please.

247
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Get him out.

248
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Get him out.

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Get him out.

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Are you from Mexico?

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
Are you from Mexico?

252
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,120
Now to be clear, I don't think most of Trump's supporters are violent bigots.

253
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,580
A lot of them are basically decent people, like Charlene, the cashier at my local 7-Eleven.

254
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,820
You know, she's having a tough time financially and her son is addicted to meth, and she herself

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,080
occasionally likes to get tweaked as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

256
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,420
Goddammit Trump, stop using racist nonsense to manipulate Charlene's brain.

257
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,260
To return to the initial question, is Trump racist?

258
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,420
Ultimately the most damning thing might be the fact that storm front neo-Nazis think that

259
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,120
Trump is trying to appeal to them with racist rhetoric.

260
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,280
If you're not being kinda racist, that's not a thing that neo-Nazis should think.

261
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,020
So I guess, yeah, that does make him pretty racist, the goddamn orangey.

262
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm just about sick of his goddamn orangey-loving followers and-

263
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,260
Ah geez. Is that racist? Oh no. I am the real racist.

264
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
