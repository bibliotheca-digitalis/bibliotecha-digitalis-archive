00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
We'll figure out, you know, we'll go out, we'll get some footage of the churches, and we'll, um, we'll edit back and forth between these two cameras.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I'll get my other camera. Where is it?

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Um, oh, yeah, I see it. I'll just get that one and we can...

00:17.000 --> 00:28.000
I just think that, you know, these ideas are getting stale. I mean, I just, it's like my brain isn't coming up with the spontaneity that is required for, you know, like...

00:28.000 --> 00:41.000
Ah, wait, Nick, I'm getting a call here from Nick. Maybe he'll help me out here, because either I'm tired or I'm just out of ideas.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Hey, Nick.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Hi.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Wait, I can't see. Are you going to go on video? Because I just see my... Oh.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I am on video.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Holy shit. What are you doing?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm... I'm going to make a video.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
What are you doing?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
You're going to make a video?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Now?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah. In a hot dog suit.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
That...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Wait.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Is that what you're wearing? A hot dog suit?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, it's my hot dog suit. And I'm wearing it.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
You know what? I don't like the sound of your... What are you drinking? What is that?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm drinking.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Did you drink that whole bottle?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I haven't slept. I've been wearing my hot dog suit. I can't sleep.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, I'm wearing my hot dog suit because my head gets hot.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Wait a minute. I really don't think you should make a video when you're in this kind of mood.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
You're not running out of ideas. Look, you don't have to resort to this kind of behavior.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I can get my banana suit.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
No, that...

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
No, no, no, because Onision wore a banana suit and everybody's going to call you a copycat. This is dangerous.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
No, you can't just wear a hot dog suit and make a video for no reason.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
People are not going to understand. People are going to unsubscribe. People are going to want to start, Nick. Nick, you can't...

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm not a copycat. I'm a copy dog.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
No. No, Nick, please don't do this. You've got to talk him out of this. I can't seem to...

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm a copy dog. I'm a copy dog. I'm hot. I'm going to make a video.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
What have you taken apart from just the alcohol this evening?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I ate a hot dog and relish.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And that's all you've eaten. No wonder he's making them sad with a hot dog.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, my God. Do you have any antacids in the house? Because this is not...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
No, I only have more scotch.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Look, okay, are you... Have you already made a video in the costume? Have you actually made the video?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
I made one video and I'm making another video right now.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Now, have you rendered it?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I... I'm trying to say it's not...

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
No, no, no, just...

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Have you rendered it?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Yes.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Okay, now...

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No, I'll load it.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Hold on. What I need you to do is just put the bottle aside and go to the start menu.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
You put your bottle aside. You're not...

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
No, no, no. It's about you, Nick. We're trying to help you.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Do you see the start menu at the bottom of your computer?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I have a Mac, God damn it.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Now...

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
How can you be so sensitive like that? Don't you know that he has a Mac?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm so sorry.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
Alright, what I need you to do is safely turn off your computer in whatever fashion the Mac allows you to do so.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Why would I turn off my computer? The computer is all I have left. All I have left is the computer...

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
If he turns off his computer, he's going to lose all contact with the outside world. That's just...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah, no, no. Okay, um...

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Wait, keep him talking.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Just listen to the sound of my voice and do everything that I tell you to do.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
When did all this start, Nick?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Okay.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
God, he's really gone. Shit.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
We've got to call somebody.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, who are you going to call? Ghostbusters? I mean, what are we going to do?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
That's a good point.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I mean, what is it...

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
We can't just let him upload it.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Because, I mean, you know, it's like there's no hotline or anything that can do anything about this.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
I mean, the police wouldn't come. They wouldn't understand the implications and the dangers of posting a video like that.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
They wouldn't understand that it's dangerous.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
We don't want to alarm him. I mean, he's on Skype. He can hear everything we're saying. Shit.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Hey, Nick, you doing all right? Yeah? You doing all right? Hey?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Nick? Can you hear us?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Why are you talking to me? I'm just a hot dog.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
No.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
No one even likes hot dogs.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
The Oreo and the hamburger have surpassed the hot dog.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I like vegetarian hot dogs.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
American culinary preferences reason Gallup polls have shown.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
He's got us on that one.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Yeah, that's true. I don't really know how to respond to that.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I'll be right back. Stay there. Stay there.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
You know, he needs to see this. I mean, if we get a specialist involved, then they need to see him when he's in one of these movies.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
All right. Well, okay. So we've got to document this.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Yeah. Okay. So, okay.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
You all right, Nick? Now, I'm not going to film this and show it to anybody. I'm not making another video.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
This is just, you know, just pretend it's not here.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I am uploading a video.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
People need to know.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I can't live in the closet anymore.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
No, no, no, wait, wait. Don't press that button.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
My mom don't see it.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
No. No. No.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No, no, no, no.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Maybe take it off because you've been wearing that thing for five days now.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's still clean.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
After five days?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I feel like I'm dirty.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Okay.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Have you taken a shower with that on?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Only with mustard.

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
So you've been bathing in mustard. Have you bathed in any other type of condiment?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
No.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Perhaps you should try water?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I bathed in relish.

05:51.000 --> 06:02.000
Okay. Now, um, I would assume that some of this food matter is decomposing under your suit right now.

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
I would advise you to very slowly remove the suit, run the water in the tub, and step in the tub.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I can't remove the suit. The mustard's dry.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Okay. Um, what do you suggest?

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
I'm going to take the suit off, even though the mustard's dry. You're going to see where my life ends.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
No. Oh.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I think it's actually good that he's taking it off.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I know that he hasn't felt fine, but you know what?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, just let him do it. Just let him do it.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I know.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Okay. He's taking it off.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Nobody can see this.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Very good. We're proud of you.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yes.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
That's good.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's really good, Nick.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
That's really good.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
It is.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Don't worry about that right now.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
That's okay. We'll watch that later.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
What you need to do is to take a shower. In water. In clean, running water.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
And then call us back as soon as you've done that. We have to stop him uploading that video.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah. No, no, no. Just don't even say it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
All right. Good idea.
