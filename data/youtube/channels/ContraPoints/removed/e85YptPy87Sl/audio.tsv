0	7000	We'll figure out, you know, we'll go out, we'll get some footage of the churches, and we'll, um, we'll edit back and forth between these two cameras.
7000	10000	I'll get my other camera. Where is it?
12000	17000	Um, oh, yeah, I see it. I'll just get that one and we can...
17000	28000	I just think that, you know, these ideas are getting stale. I mean, I just, it's like my brain isn't coming up with the spontaneity that is required for, you know, like...
28000	41000	Ah, wait, Nick, I'm getting a call here from Nick. Maybe he'll help me out here, because either I'm tired or I'm just out of ideas.
43000	44000	Hey, Nick.
45000	46000	Hi.
47000	52000	Wait, I can't see. Are you going to go on video? Because I just see my... Oh.
52000	53000	I am on video.
53000	55000	Holy shit. What are you doing?
56000	58000	I'm... I'm going to make a video.
58000	59000	What are you doing?
59000	60000	You're going to make a video?
61000	62000	Now?
62000	64000	Yeah. In a hot dog suit.
66000	67000	That...
67000	68000	Wait.
68000	70000	Is that what you're wearing? A hot dog suit?
71000	74000	Yeah, it's my hot dog suit. And I'm wearing it.
75000	81000	You know what? I don't like the sound of your... What are you drinking? What is that?
83000	84000	I'm drinking.
84000	86000	Did you drink that whole bottle?
86000	91000	I haven't slept. I've been wearing my hot dog suit. I can't sleep.
91000	94000	Well, I'm wearing my hot dog suit because my head gets hot.
94000	98000	Wait a minute. I really don't think you should make a video when you're in this kind of mood.
98000	102000	You're not running out of ideas. Look, you don't have to resort to this kind of behavior.
102000	104000	I can get my banana suit.
104000	105000	No, that...
105000	110000	No, no, no, because Onision wore a banana suit and everybody's going to call you a copycat. This is dangerous.
110000	115000	No, you can't just wear a hot dog suit and make a video for no reason.
115000	120000	People are not going to understand. People are going to unsubscribe. People are going to want to start, Nick. Nick, you can't...
120000	122000	I'm not a copycat. I'm a copy dog.
122000	127000	No. No, Nick, please don't do this. You've got to talk him out of this. I can't seem to...
127000	131000	I'm a copy dog. I'm a copy dog. I'm hot. I'm going to make a video.
131000	135000	What have you taken apart from just the alcohol this evening?
136000	139000	I ate a hot dog and relish.
139000	142000	And that's all you've eaten. No wonder he's making them sad with a hot dog.
142000	148000	Oh, my God. Do you have any antacids in the house? Because this is not...
148000	150000	No, I only have more scotch.
150000	156000	Look, okay, are you... Have you already made a video in the costume? Have you actually made the video?
156000	160000	I made one video and I'm making another video right now.
160000	162000	Now, have you rendered it?
162000	164000	I... I'm trying to say it's not...
164000	165000	No, no, no, just...
165000	167000	Have you rendered it?
167000	168000	Yes.
168000	169000	Okay, now...
169000	170000	No, I'll load it.
170000	179000	No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Hold on. What I need you to do is just put the bottle aside and go to the start menu.
179000	181000	You put your bottle aside. You're not...
181000	184000	No, no, no. It's about you, Nick. We're trying to help you.
184000	187000	Do you see the start menu at the bottom of your computer?
187000	189000	I have a Mac, God damn it.
189000	190000	Now...
190000	193000	How can you be so sensitive like that? Don't you know that he has a Mac?
193000	195000	God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
195000	196000	I'm so sorry.
196000	204000	Alright, what I need you to do is safely turn off your computer in whatever fashion the Mac allows you to do so.
204000	208000	Why would I turn off my computer? The computer is all I have left. All I have left is the computer...
208000	214000	If he turns off his computer, he's going to lose all contact with the outside world. That's just...
214000	215000	Yeah, no, no. Okay, um...
215000	216000	Wait, keep him talking.
216000	219000	Just listen to the sound of my voice and do everything that I tell you to do.
220000	222000	When did all this start, Nick?
222000	223000	Okay.
227000	230000	God, he's really gone. Shit.
231000	233000	We've got to call somebody.
233000	237000	Yeah, who are you going to call? Ghostbusters? I mean, what are we going to do?
237000	239000	That's a good point.
239000	240000	I mean, what is it...
240000	242000	We can't just let him upload it.
242000	246000	Because, I mean, you know, it's like there's no hotline or anything that can do anything about this.
246000	252000	I mean, the police wouldn't come. They wouldn't understand the implications and the dangers of posting a video like that.
252000	254000	They wouldn't understand that it's dangerous.
254000	257000	We don't want to alarm him. I mean, he's on Skype. He can hear everything we're saying. Shit.
257000	261000	Hey, Nick, you doing all right? Yeah? You doing all right? Hey?
261000	263000	Nick? Can you hear us?
263000	264000	Yeah.
264000	267000	Why are you talking to me? I'm just a hot dog.
267000	268000	No.
268000	269000	No one even likes hot dogs.
269000	273000	The Oreo and the hamburger have surpassed the hot dog.
273000	275000	I like vegetarian hot dogs.
275000	281000	American culinary preferences reason Gallup polls have shown.
281000	282000	He's got us on that one.
282000	285000	Yeah, that's true. I don't really know how to respond to that.
285000	289000	I'll be right back. Stay there. Stay there.
289000	294000	You know, he needs to see this. I mean, if we get a specialist involved, then they need to see him when he's in one of these movies.
294000	296000	All right. Well, okay. So we've got to document this.
296000	298000	Yeah. Okay. So, okay.
298000	303000	You all right, Nick? Now, I'm not going to film this and show it to anybody. I'm not making another video.
303000	307000	This is just, you know, just pretend it's not here.
307000	308000	I am uploading a video.
308000	309000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
309000	310000	People need to know.
310000	311000	Okay.
311000	312000	I can't live in the closet anymore.
312000	315000	No, no, no, wait, wait. Don't press that button.
315000	316000	My mom don't see it.
316000	319000	No. No. No.
319000	320000	No, no, no, no.
320000	324000	Maybe take it off because you've been wearing that thing for five days now.
324000	326000	It's still clean.
326000	327000	After five days?
327000	329000	I feel like I'm dirty.
329000	330000	Okay.
330000	332000	Have you taken a shower with that on?
332000	333000	Yeah.
333000	335000	Only with mustard.
335000	343000	So you've been bathing in mustard. Have you bathed in any other type of condiment?
343000	345000	No.
345000	349000	Perhaps you should try water?
349000	351000	I bathed in relish.
351000	362000	Okay. Now, um, I would assume that some of this food matter is decomposing under your suit right now.
362000	371000	I would advise you to very slowly remove the suit, run the water in the tub, and step in the tub.
371000	374000	I can't remove the suit. The mustard's dry.
374000	379000	Okay. Um, what do you suggest?
380000	386000	I'm going to take the suit off, even though the mustard's dry. You're going to see where my life ends.
386000	388000	No. Oh.
388000	390000	I think it's actually good that he's taking it off.
390000	392000	I know that he hasn't felt fine, but you know what?
392000	394000	Yeah, just let him do it. Just let him do it.
394000	395000	I know.
395000	396000	Okay. He's taking it off.
396000	397000	Nobody can see this.
397000	398000	Very good. We're proud of you.
398000	399000	Yes.
399000	400000	That's good.
400000	401000	That's really good, Nick.
401000	402000	That's really good.
402000	403000	It is.
403000	404000	Don't worry about that right now.
404000	405000	That's okay. We'll watch that later.
405000	410000	What you need to do is to take a shower. In water. In clean, running water.
410000	414000	And then call us back as soon as you've done that. We have to stop him uploading that video.
414000	415000	Yeah. No, no, no. Just don't even say it.
415000	417000	All right. Good idea.
