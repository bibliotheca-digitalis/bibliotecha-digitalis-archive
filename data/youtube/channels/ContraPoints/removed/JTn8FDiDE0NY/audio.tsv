0	9000	No, I hope everyone knows I'm joking, particularly the majority of my subscribers are from America, but...
9000	13000	Do you think I was going to go to a subscriber list and speak like half and he's like,
13000	15000	what happened?
15000	25000	Because we get programs like Oprah and Montel and stuff like that, where you've got a stupid audience.
25000	27000	I'm so sorry.
27000	29000	I apologize.
29000	38000	You've got bearded ladies and everyone's fat, everyone's stupid, and everyone's into bread.
38000	41000	That's the impression you get from watching these days.
41000	45000	I like bread! I like bread!
45000	54000	See, we get like fucking upstairs downstairs in Doctor Who and all creatures great and small and all this other shit.
54000	57000	I don't watch television.
58000	60000	Honestly, I don't.
60000	62000	I don't either. It's weird.
62000	66000	I've probably watched about an hour of television in the last six months.
66000	68000	I don't even think I've watched television in the last...
68000	69000	It just forced me.
69000	70000	Yeah, me too.
70000	76000	I watch certain shows, but I don't watch it on television except from a house.
76000	78000	Or, yeah, it's about a house.
78000	79000	But even that show is kind of...
79000	82000	How important was it? No, it wasn't porn that I watched.
82000	84000	I watched that on my computer.
84000	86000	I want to watch the show.
86000	87000	I'm a normal person.
87000	90000	Or you, Jizz. That's not bad.
90000	94000	I eat steel hamburgers and I watch bread.
96000	99000	I'm sorry. It's an inside joke.
99000	101000	I missed it as well. I'm sorry.
101000	103000	I have a friend named Steel Hamburger and he says,
103000	106000	I don't watch TV, but I watch the hell out of some bread,
106000	112000	and I said, I eat steel hamburgers in my TV dinner while I watch bread.
115000	116000	Yeah.
116000	117000	Is that a joke?
117000	120000	Yeah. It's a hilarious joke.
120000	122000	I don't get your young humor.
122000	124000	Can you tell me at which point I'm supposed to laugh?
124000	125000	I'm sorry.
125000	126000	It's not the kind of joke when you...
126000	128000	I didn't understand it. I'm sorry.
130000	132000	You herded my feelings.
133000	136000	So, Tool, where are you headed to?
136000	137000	You're saying you're seeing your sister.
137000	139000	Is that over the Christmas period or...
139000	140000	Yeah.
140000	142000	Like a passing visit or what?
142000	144000	Yeah, over the Christmas period.
144000	145000	Yeah?
147000	150000	Isn't she somewhere near Canada?
150000	153000	No. That's where I grew up near Canada.
153000	154000	Sorry?
154000	156000	I said I grew up near Canada.
156000	159000	She lives sort of near New York City.
159000	160000	Okay.
160000	164000	And what do the other two do for Christmas?
164000	166000	What are your plans?
166000	168000	I don't usually go to Christmas.
168000	170000	What are your plans?
170000	173000	I don't usually plan stuff.
173000	176000	Try to avoid hearing Christmas music as much as possible.
176000	179000	Sorry, Nick. I'm struggling to hear you.
179000	180000	You say you avoid Christmas.
180000	182000	I avoid Christmas music.
182000	184000	Yeah. We'll just not go into any stores.
184000	186000	Yeah. We can't go into stores.
186000	188000	We're going to have a hard time.
188000	192000	I don't know. Maybe you can get your groceries delivered to you.
192000	193000	I want to.
193000	194000	Some places have that.
194000	195000	That would be amazing.
195000	197000	Whole foods, I think, will do it so expensive.
197000	201000	Even when you buy groceries yourself, it's expensive.
201000	205000	But, yeah, they have a delivery service.
207000	209000	Yeah, I want my food delivered to me.
209000	210000	Yeah.
210000	213000	Why should I go get food when it can go get me?
213000	217000	Well, I've got two potential videos coming up over Christmas.
217000	220000	One is me cooking Christmas dinner.
220000	221000	Awesome.
221000	226000	And the other is, hopefully, hopefully...
226000	229000	Shit, the audio has just broken up again.
229000	234000	Hopefully, I'm going to meet up with Thunderfoot.
234000	235000	Who foot?
235000	239000	He'll be, he'll be, he'll be on his way back to America.
239000	241000	So, there's a lovely video.
241000	243000	I've got time for that.
243000	244000	If we can...
244000	247000	He lives only about 30 minutes away from me.
247000	249000	So, hopefully, we'll meet up.
249000	253000	Oh, does he have, like, a residence in the UK as well?
253000	257000	Well, he's born and brought up here, wasn't he?
257000	261000	And happens to, his family home happens to be about 30 minutes away from him.
261000	262000	Oh.
262000	264000	I never would have noticed with his accent.
264000	266000	He was from the UK.
269000	271000	Well, I'm not being funny, but I can't believe it.
271000	278000	It's like when people say that Thunderfoot and myself sound the same.
278000	281000	I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
281000	282000	Yeah.
282000	285000	It's like they're saying all Americans sound the same.
285000	290000	I find it as insulting as saying that you sound like Nephilim 3.
290000	292000	That's how ridiculous it is.
292000	295000	Well, we're not going to tell Thunderfoot that you said that.
295000	297000	Hey, at least you're not Welsh.
297000	302000	You can always thank yourself for that.
302000	303000	Or are you Welsh?
303000	307000	Maybe you are and I just insulted you.
307000	310000	People from Canada are all the same, though.
310000	311000	It's all right.
311000	312000	The Sarahan.
312000	314000	Yeah, well, that's good.
314000	317000	So we can start with the Welsh jokes now.
317000	319000	Bring on the Welsh jokes.
319000	322000	Bring it on.
322000	323000	How do you know about Welsh jokes?
323000	324000	You're American.
324000	327000	You're not supposed to know anything outside of America.
327000	329000	They mostly involve leaks, if I'm not mistaken.
329000	330000	You're English.
330000	332000	You're not supposed to know anything about bread.
332000	334000	And sheep fucking too.
334000	342000	Sheep fucking and leeks.
342000	346000	Are we going to get some more music videos?
346000	347000	Nicotine?
347000	348000	Yeah, that's...
348000	350000	We're going to get a few more...
350000	352000	Nicotine's going to rap.
352000	355000	That's not going to happen.
355000	356000	That would be awesome.
356000	358000	Sorry, I missed the answer.
358000	360000	Maybe play some Christmas carols or something.
360000	362000	Yeah, we'll see about that.
362000	365000	No jingle bell rock, though.
365000	367000	I'd rather shoot myself.
367000	368000	That's serious.
368000	370000	I thought that you were...
370000	373000	Scholastic, however you pronounce it.
373000	374000	I'm sorry, I'm dyslexic.
374000	376000	I thought that was absolutely beautiful.
376000	377000	Thank you.
377000	379000	Yeah, I'll probably do more of those.
379000	381000	Unfortunately, I don't have...
381000	384000	The keyboard that I have here is useless.
384000	386000	I wish I had a real piano.
386000	389000	I'd have him, I'd say, entertain us.
389000	392000	Play piano and entertain the crowd.
392000	398000	But no, I don't have any such keyboard.
398000	399000	We played...
399000	401000	Cathy did this beautiful singing.
401000	405000	Bonnet was a holy moe.
405000	410000	So what's Santa Claus going to bring everyone for Christmas?
410000	412000	Kittens, I think.
412000	414000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
414000	419000	I don't want Santa Claus in the house anymore after last Christmas.
419000	426000	He tried to judge my no-no spot, so...
426000	428000	I have a restraining order against him.
428000	429000	How much wine is that?
429000	437000	No-no spot.
437000	440000	Well, there were two wonderful answers there.
440000	446000	Sarah Hawn's getting her football, and Shelly Simmons is getting another cup size.
446000	459000	I'll probably just get some very small amount of money that will be spent on food, because I'm starving.
459000	463000	Sorry, you're not going to eat before Christmas?
463000	464000	No, I'm just...
464000	467000	Didn't you find a gentleman offered to take you out for dinner this evening?
468000	470000	We had some pizza before.
470000	472000	It was fucking amazing pizza.
472000	474000	Yeah, it was really good pizza.
474000	477000	And I pretty much ate most of it.
477000	479000	I don't think so.
479000	482000	We're like, oh, we're going to order a small and a large.
482000	484000	We're going to eat the small and take the large home.
484000	488000	And we wound up leaving with three pieces left.
488000	490000	Well, one for each of us.
490000	494000	Did nicotine eat any? Because he's a skinny fucker, isn't he?
494000	496000	Aw, he did eat.
496000	499000	But then he went and threw it up in the bathroom afterwards.
507000	508000	Aw, my stuff.
508000	510000	I know you because of the crazy lot you've said here.
510000	511000	Ah, thank you.
511000	515000	I'm sure in one of your blog programs you showed what a skinny fucker you were.
515000	520000	What are you, about six foot two, and about eight stone or something?
520000	522000	He probably weighs about as much as that.
523000	528000	You don't use that language in America-land, you know?
528000	530000	Like eight stone, like what?
534000	537000	Can you do some doctor?
537000	539000	Can I do what?
539000	540000	Sums.
540000	542000	Sums, I guess.
542000	544000	Multiplication.
544000	547000	Um, I went to public school, so let me roll it first.
547000	549000	Eight by fourteen.
549000	552000	Eight times fourteen?
552000	554000	Mm-hmm. It's quite easy.
554000	558000	Times it by ten, you get 240, and then take off 28.
561000	562000	240?
562000	564000	That's the way I would do it in my head.
567000	568000	Who uses stones?
568000	570000	That's how many pounds eight stone is.
570000	573000	Debate Crusher is trying to reach you.
573000	576000	In order to contact this user, you must close tabs.
576000	578000	Do we want to contact Debate Crusher?
578000	582000	Yeah, let's see what Debate Crusher has to say.
582000	584000	It's so funny he just appeared.
584000	586000	Eight times fifteen.
586000	588000	It's 120.
588000	591000	Did you say eight times fifteen?
591000	592000	Fourteen.
592000	593000	Fourteen?
593000	595000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
595000	598000	It's like fucking pulling teeth.
598000	601000	Fourteen pounds in a stone, right?
601000	603000	Eight stones.
604000	606000	Eight times fourteen.
606000	608000	It's 112.
608000	610000	There you go. Did you just do that on your...
610000	614000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I went to fucking public school, alright?
614000	617000	You went to public school to work out how to...
617000	618000	I don't understand what the question is.
618000	621000	No, you're from England, you don't understand what that means.
621000	627000	Like, when I say I went to public school, it means I was educated worth a shit.
627000	630000	It's still better than homeschooling, like...
630000	633000	Can we add fat to the call?
633000	635000	Yeah, let's add her to the call.
635000	637000	Would you add her, or should I...
637000	639000	Three way call.
639000	640000	It's my call, so I'll add her.
640000	641000	Okay, good.
641000	643000	Because I still...
