1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No, I hope everyone knows I'm joking, particularly the majority of my subscribers are from America, but...

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Do you think I was going to go to a subscriber list and speak like half and he's like,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
what happened?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Because we get programs like Oprah and Montel and stuff like that, where you've got a stupid audience.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I apologize.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You've got bearded ladies and everyone's fat, everyone's stupid, and everyone's into bread.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's the impression you get from watching these days.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I like bread! I like bread!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
See, we get like fucking upstairs downstairs in Doctor Who and all creatures great and small and all this other shit.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't watch television.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Honestly, I don't.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't either. It's weird.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've probably watched about an hour of television in the last six months.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't even think I've watched television in the last...

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It just forced me.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, me too.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I watch certain shows, but I don't watch it on television except from a house.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or, yeah, it's about a house.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But even that show is kind of...

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How important was it? No, it wasn't porn that I watched.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I watched that on my computer.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want to watch the show.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm a normal person.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or you, Jizz. That's not bad.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I eat steel hamburgers and I watch bread.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry. It's an inside joke.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I missed it as well. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have a friend named Steel Hamburger and he says,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't watch TV, but I watch the hell out of some bread,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and I said, I eat steel hamburgers in my TV dinner while I watch bread.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is that a joke?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah. It's a hilarious joke.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't get your young humor.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can you tell me at which point I'm supposed to laugh?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not the kind of joke when you...

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't understand it. I'm sorry.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You herded my feelings.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, Tool, where are you headed to?

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're saying you're seeing your sister.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is that over the Christmas period or...

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like a passing visit or what?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, over the Christmas period.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Isn't she somewhere near Canada?

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No. That's where I grew up near Canada.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I said I grew up near Canada.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She lives sort of near New York City.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And what do the other two do for Christmas?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are your plans?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't usually go to Christmas.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are your plans?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't usually plan stuff.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Try to avoid hearing Christmas music as much as possible.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sorry, Nick. I'm struggling to hear you.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You say you avoid Christmas.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I avoid Christmas music.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah. We'll just not go into any stores.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah. We can't go into stores.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We're going to have a hard time.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know. Maybe you can get your groceries delivered to you.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Some places have that.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That would be amazing.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Whole foods, I think, will do it so expensive.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Even when you buy groceries yourself, it's expensive.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But, yeah, they have a delivery service.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, I want my food delivered to me.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why should I go get food when it can go get me?

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, I've got two potential videos coming up over Christmas.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
One is me cooking Christmas dinner.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Awesome.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the other is, hopefully, hopefully...

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Shit, the audio has just broken up again.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hopefully, I'm going to meet up with Thunderfoot.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who foot?

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He'll be, he'll be, he'll be on his way back to America.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, there's a lovely video.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've got time for that.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If we can...

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He lives only about 30 minutes away from me.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, hopefully, we'll meet up.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, does he have, like, a residence in the UK as well?

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, he's born and brought up here, wasn't he?

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And happens to, his family home happens to be about 30 minutes away from him.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I never would have noticed with his accent.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He was from the UK.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, I'm not being funny, but I can't believe it.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like when people say that Thunderfoot and myself sound the same.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's like they're saying all Americans sound the same.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I find it as insulting as saying that you sound like Nephilim 3.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's how ridiculous it is.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, we're not going to tell Thunderfoot that you said that.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey, at least you're not Welsh.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can always thank yourself for that.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Or are you Welsh?

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Maybe you are and I just insulted you.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
People from Canada are all the same, though.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's all right.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The Sarahan.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, well, that's good.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we can start with the Welsh jokes now.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Bring on the Welsh jokes.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Bring it on.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How do you know about Welsh jokes?

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're American.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're not supposed to know anything outside of America.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They mostly involve leaks, if I'm not mistaken.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're English.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're not supposed to know anything about bread.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And sheep fucking too.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sheep fucking and leeks.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are we going to get some more music videos?

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nicotine?

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, that's...

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We're going to get a few more...

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Nicotine's going to rap.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's not going to happen.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That would be awesome.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sorry, I missed the answer.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Maybe play some Christmas carols or something.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, we'll see about that.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No jingle bell rock, though.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'd rather shoot myself.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's serious.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I thought that you were...

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Scholastic, however you pronounce it.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm dyslexic.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I thought that was absolutely beautiful.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, I'll probably do more of those.

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Unfortunately, I don't have...

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The keyboard that I have here is useless.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I wish I had a real piano.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'd have him, I'd say, entertain us.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Play piano and entertain the crowd.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But no, I don't have any such keyboard.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We played...

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Cathy did this beautiful singing.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Bonnet was a holy moe.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So what's Santa Claus going to bring everyone for Christmas?

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Kittens, I think.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't want Santa Claus in the house anymore after last Christmas.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He tried to judge my no-no spot, so...

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have a restraining order against him.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How much wine is that?

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No-no spot.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, there were two wonderful answers there.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sarah Hawn's getting her football, and Shelly Simmons is getting another cup size.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll probably just get some very small amount of money that will be spent on food, because I'm starving.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sorry, you're not going to eat before Christmas?

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, I'm just...

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Didn't you find a gentleman offered to take you out for dinner this evening?

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We had some pizza before.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It was fucking amazing pizza.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, it was really good pizza.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I pretty much ate most of it.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think so.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're like, oh, we're going to order a small and a large.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're going to eat the small and take the large home.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And we wound up leaving with three pieces left.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, one for each of us.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Did nicotine eat any? Because he's a skinny fucker, isn't he?

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Aw, he did eat.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But then he went and threw it up in the bathroom afterwards.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Aw, my stuff.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know you because of the crazy lot you've said here.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ah, thank you.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sure in one of your blog programs you showed what a skinny fucker you were.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you, about six foot two, and about eight stone or something?

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He probably weighs about as much as that.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You don't use that language in America-land, you know?

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Like eight stone, like what?

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Can you do some doctor?

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can I do what?

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sums.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sums, I guess.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Multiplication.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Um, I went to public school, so let me roll it first.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Eight by fourteen.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Eight times fourteen?

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mm-hmm. It's quite easy.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Times it by ten, you get 240, and then take off 28.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
240?

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's the way I would do it in my head.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Who uses stones?

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's how many pounds eight stone is.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Debate Crusher is trying to reach you.

Do we want to contact Debate Crusher?

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, let's see what Debate Crusher has to say.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's so funny he just appeared.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Eight times fifteen.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's 120.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Did you say eight times fifteen?

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fourteen.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Fourteen?

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's like fucking pulling teeth.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Fourteen pounds in a stone, right?

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Eight stones.

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Eight times fourteen.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's 112.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There you go. Did you just do that on your...

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I went to fucking public school, alright?

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You went to public school to work out how to...

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't understand what the question is.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, you're from England, you don't understand what that means.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like, when I say I went to public school, it means I was educated worth a shit.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's still better than homeschooling, like...

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Can we add fat to the call?

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, let's add her to the call.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Would you add her, or should I...

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Three way call.

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's my call, so I'll add her.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, good.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Because I still...
