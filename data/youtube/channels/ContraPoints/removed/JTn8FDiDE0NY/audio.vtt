00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
No, I hope everyone knows I'm joking, particularly the majority of my subscribers are from America, but...

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Do you think I was going to go to a subscriber list and speak like half and he's like,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
what happened?

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
Because we get programs like Oprah and Montel and stuff like that, where you've got a stupid audience.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm so sorry.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I apologize.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.000
You've got bearded ladies and everyone's fat, everyone's stupid, and everyone's into bread.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
That's the impression you get from watching these days.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I like bread! I like bread!

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
See, we get like fucking upstairs downstairs in Doctor Who and all creatures great and small and all this other shit.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I don't watch television.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Honestly, I don't.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I don't either. It's weird.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I've probably watched about an hour of television in the last six months.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I don't even think I've watched television in the last...

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
It just forced me.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, me too.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
I watch certain shows, but I don't watch it on television except from a house.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Or, yeah, it's about a house.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
But even that show is kind of...

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
How important was it? No, it wasn't porn that I watched.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I watched that on my computer.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I want to watch the show.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm a normal person.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Or you, Jizz. That's not bad.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I eat steel hamburgers and I watch bread.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm sorry. It's an inside joke.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I missed it as well. I'm sorry.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I have a friend named Steel Hamburger and he says,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't watch TV, but I watch the hell out of some bread,

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
and I said, I eat steel hamburgers in my TV dinner while I watch bread.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Is that a joke?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah. It's a hilarious joke.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't get your young humor.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Can you tell me at which point I'm supposed to laugh?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm sorry.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
It's not the kind of joke when you...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I didn't understand it. I'm sorry.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You herded my feelings.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
So, Tool, where are you headed to?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
You're saying you're seeing your sister.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Is that over the Christmas period or...

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Like a passing visit or what?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, over the Christmas period.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Isn't she somewhere near Canada?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
No. That's where I grew up near Canada.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Sorry?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I said I grew up near Canada.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
She lives sort of near New York City.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And what do the other two do for Christmas?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
What are your plans?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I don't usually go to Christmas.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
What are your plans?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I don't usually plan stuff.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Try to avoid hearing Christmas music as much as possible.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Sorry, Nick. I'm struggling to hear you.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
You say you avoid Christmas.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I avoid Christmas music.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah. We'll just not go into any stores.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah. We can't go into stores.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
We're going to have a hard time.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't know. Maybe you can get your groceries delivered to you.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I want to.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Some places have that.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
That would be amazing.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Whole foods, I think, will do it so expensive.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Even when you buy groceries yourself, it's expensive.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
But, yeah, they have a delivery service.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, I want my food delivered to me.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Why should I go get food when it can go get me?

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Well, I've got two potential videos coming up over Christmas.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
One is me cooking Christmas dinner.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Awesome.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And the other is, hopefully, hopefully...

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Shit, the audio has just broken up again.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Hopefully, I'm going to meet up with Thunderfoot.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Who foot?

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
He'll be, he'll be, he'll be on his way back to America.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So, there's a lovely video.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I've got time for that.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
If we can...

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
He lives only about 30 minutes away from me.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
So, hopefully, we'll meet up.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, does he have, like, a residence in the UK as well?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, he's born and brought up here, wasn't he?

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
And happens to, his family home happens to be about 30 minutes away from him.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I never would have noticed with his accent.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
He was from the UK.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Well, I'm not being funny, but I can't believe it.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
It's like when people say that Thunderfoot and myself sound the same.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I think it's absolutely ridiculous.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It's like they're saying all Americans sound the same.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I find it as insulting as saying that you sound like Nephilim 3.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
That's how ridiculous it is.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, we're not going to tell Thunderfoot that you said that.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Hey, at least you're not Welsh.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
You can always thank yourself for that.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Or are you Welsh?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Maybe you are and I just insulted you.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
People from Canada are all the same, though.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
It's all right.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
The Sarahan.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, well, that's good.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
So we can start with the Welsh jokes now.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Bring on the Welsh jokes.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Bring it on.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
How do you know about Welsh jokes?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
You're American.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
You're not supposed to know anything outside of America.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
They mostly involve leaks, if I'm not mistaken.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You're English.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You're not supposed to know anything about bread.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And sheep fucking too.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
Sheep fucking and leeks.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Are we going to get some more music videos?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Nicotine?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, that's...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
We're going to get a few more...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Nicotine's going to rap.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
That's not going to happen.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That would be awesome.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Sorry, I missed the answer.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Maybe play some Christmas carols or something.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, we'll see about that.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
No jingle bell rock, though.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I'd rather shoot myself.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
That's serious.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I thought that you were...

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Scholastic, however you pronounce it.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm sorry, I'm dyslexic.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I thought that was absolutely beautiful.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Thank you.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, I'll probably do more of those.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Unfortunately, I don't have...

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
The keyboard that I have here is useless.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I wish I had a real piano.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I'd have him, I'd say, entertain us.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Play piano and entertain the crowd.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
But no, I don't have any such keyboard.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
We played...

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Cathy did this beautiful singing.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Bonnet was a holy moe.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
So what's Santa Claus going to bring everyone for Christmas?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Kittens, I think.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
I don't want Santa Claus in the house anymore after last Christmas.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
He tried to judge my no-no spot, so...

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I have a restraining order against him.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
How much wine is that?

07:09.000 --> 07:17.000
No-no spot.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, there were two wonderful answers there.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
Sarah Hawn's getting her football, and Shelly Simmons is getting another cup size.

07:26.000 --> 07:39.000
I'll probably just get some very small amount of money that will be spent on food, because I'm starving.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Sorry, you're not going to eat before Christmas?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
No, I'm just...

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Didn't you find a gentleman offered to take you out for dinner this evening?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We had some pizza before.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
It was fucking amazing pizza.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, it was really good pizza.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
And I pretty much ate most of it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't think so.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
We're like, oh, we're going to order a small and a large.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
We're going to eat the small and take the large home.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
And we wound up leaving with three pieces left.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, one for each of us.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Did nicotine eat any? Because he's a skinny fucker, isn't he?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Aw, he did eat.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
But then he went and threw it up in the bathroom afterwards.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Aw, my stuff.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I know you because of the crazy lot you've said here.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Ah, thank you.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm sure in one of your blog programs you showed what a skinny fucker you were.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
What are you, about six foot two, and about eight stone or something?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
He probably weighs about as much as that.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
You don't use that language in America-land, you know?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Like eight stone, like what?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Can you do some doctor?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Can I do what?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Sums.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Sums, I guess.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Multiplication.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Um, I went to public school, so let me roll it first.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Eight by fourteen.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Eight times fourteen?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Mm-hmm. It's quite easy.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Times it by ten, you get 240, and then take off 28.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
240?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
That's the way I would do it in my head.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Who uses stones?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That's how many pounds eight stone is.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Debate Crusher is trying to reach you.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
In order to contact this user, you must close tabs.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Do we want to contact Debate Crusher?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, let's see what Debate Crusher has to say.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's so funny he just appeared.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Eight times fifteen.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
It's 120.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Did you say eight times fifteen?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Fourteen.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Fourteen?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It's like fucking pulling teeth.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Fourteen pounds in a stone, right?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Eight stones.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Eight times fourteen.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It's 112.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There you go. Did you just do that on your...

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I went to fucking public school, alright?

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
You went to public school to work out how to...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I don't understand what the question is.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
No, you're from England, you don't understand what that means.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Like, when I say I went to public school, it means I was educated worth a shit.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
It's still better than homeschooling, like...

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Can we add fat to the call?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah, let's add her to the call.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Would you add her, or should I...

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Three way call.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's my call, so I'll add her.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Okay, good.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Because I still...
