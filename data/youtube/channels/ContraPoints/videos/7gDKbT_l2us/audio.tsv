0	3200	Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.
6160	7720	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
10920	12620	Something wicked this way comes.
13520	16000	Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.
16000	17200	Magical darkness.
20240	21340	A must.
23560	25760	Joanne, I wanna talk to you, Joanne.
27480	29400	What is it about Joannes?
29400	31480	I can't catch a break from these people.
31480	35000	So, now that 2020 is finally over,
35000	38040	I think we can let the record conclusively show
38040	40300	that it was a year whomst is bad.
40300	42480	And on top of everything else that was going on,
42480	44080	truly the last thing we needed
44080	47040	was the author of Harry Potter coming forward to announce
47040	49400	there's two things she can't stand,
49400	52680	bigotry and the transgenders.
52680	53800	Ow.
53800	58000	Elderberry wand, turgid, with a core of,
59920	61880	ice dragon, lumos.
61880	63120	Can we afford spells?
63120	64040	Is that in the budget?
64040	66080	Expecto Patreon.
66080	67360	So, you've probably heard by now
67360	70120	about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.
70120	71820	Unless you've been living under a rock,
71820	74640	in which case, get back under that rock, sweetie.
74640	76640	There is nothing good going on up here.
76640	77560	It's not worth it.
77560	79320	Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did
79320	81680	was say biological sex is real,
81680	85400	and now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists
85400	87040	are trying to silence her.
87040	89080	This is cancel culture gone too far.
89760	90800	This is a witch hunt.
90800	92720	Celebrities are under attack.
92720	94280	This is the new Salem.
94280	96040	This is Orwell's nightmare.
96040	98160	This is a painful topic for me all around
98160	100720	because as a transgender woman,
100720	103840	I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things
103840	105640	Joanne has said in the last year.
105640	107640	But I also know what it's like
107640	109400	to be the target of a Twitter mob.
109400	111540	And I realize that to most people,
111540	114680	complaining about being canceled,
114680	117720	it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.
117720	120200	Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people
120200	122920	like J.K. Rowling would be above
122920	124440	staying up alone at night
124440	127440	reading mean things people say online.
127440	129000	But you'd think wrong.
129000	131480	See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness
131480	132680	of the human condition,
132680	135760	and no amount of fame and money is gonna fix that.
135760	138760	You know, fame alienates you from other people.
138760	141920	It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,
141920	144680	which can actually make you feel more alone,
144680	147560	even when people are worshiping you as a goddess.
148360	150520	Nevermind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.
150520	154080	The truth is that unless you've personally experienced
154080	156400	infamy, being shamed and shunned
156400	159560	on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,
159560	161400	then you just don't know what it's like.
161400	164320	And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.
164320	165680	But Joanne knows,
165680	168700	and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,
168700	170260	there's a traumatized part of me
170260	173800	that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.
173800	174920	And I wanna protect
175840	177680	my nurturing and compassionate nature
177680	179960	sometimes gets the best of me.
179960	181360	But there's also a part of me that wants
181360	182600	to join the trashing.
182600	184720	How could you do this to me, Joanne?
184720	186160	I did not come out of the cupboard
186160	187480	under the stairs for this.
187480	188960	So what I wanna do in this video
188960	191240	is take Joanne's pain seriously
191240	193680	and treat her like a complex human being,
193680	196960	while also being critical of the things she said
196960	199600	about the transgender question.
199600	202080	And I also wanna explore where the Twitter mob
202080	203160	is coming from,
203160	205280	because they're in pain too,
205280	208120	and don't they also deserve our understanding?
208120	209560	So without further ado,
209560	214240	let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush
214240	217440	and see if we can find the truth.
217440	218700	Swish and flick.
218700	221200	♪♪♪
221200	234160	So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?
234160	235840	Well, she certainly seems invested
235840	238120	in the belief that she's not a bigot.
238120	240560	What vice do you most despise?
240560	241400	Bigotry.
241400	243240	And looking over Joanne's tweets,
243240	244800	I don't think the average person
244800	247360	would see any problem with what she's said.
247360	250160	However, I mean, not to be condescending,
250160	253040	but I feel like the average person's understanding
253040	256760	of transgender is still a little bit,
256760	259600	I don't really get the whole trans thing.
259600	262960	Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?
264480	267560	I don't know, Amber, why don't you be a feminine man?
267560	269440	Who knows, you could be missing out.
269440	270960	So we're gonna go through the things
270960	272760	that Joanne has said about trans people,
272760	275880	but I don't want this to be just a drama video
275880	279640	or a video saying cancel Harry Potter, drag her.
280000	280960	I wanna try to do something
280960	283360	a little bit more meaningful than that.
283360	287840	So I'm gonna use JK Rowe as a case study in bigotry
287840	290320	and see if we can maybe learn something
290320	292600	about what bigotry is.
292600	293820	How does it work?
293820	297040	And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?
297040	299640	And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,
299640	301440	well, for once I think I'll actually
301440	303760	have earned my Patreon budget.
303760	307420	So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,
307420	310280	let's spill some shade, throw some tea.
311140	313100	So this all started in 2018
313100	315660	when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet
315660	317980	and followed an anti-trans account.
317980	319300	Now in the interest of giving Joanne
319300	321380	as much benefit of the doubt as I can,
321380	323100	I'm not gonna admit this as evidence
323100	325740	because I don't wanna do guilt by association.
325740	327800	Strike it from the record.
327800	329700	That was fun, I like hammering things.
329700	334220	The real story begins in December 2019
334220	337340	when Joanne tweeted the hashtag I stand with Maya
338060	339060	referencing Maya Forstater.
339060	341220	Maya Forstater is an English consultant
341220	344020	who lost her contract with the nonprofit she worked for
344020	346620	after she did transphobic tweets.
346620	349460	And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us
349460	353140	in her thread titled Allegedly Transphobic Tweets.
353140	357140	Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.
357140	359480	Yes, I think that male people are not women.
359480	361460	I don't think that being a woman or female
361460	364140	is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.
364140	365300	It is biology.
365340	366340	Another says.
366340	367860	Some people believe that a person
367860	369500	with a penis can be a woman.
369500	371860	Some, a majority, don't.
371860	373740	Neither group should be discriminated against
373740	375820	in everyday life, but in situations
375820	378160	involving taking your clothes off for strangers,
378160	380620	integration of the two groups is not possible.
380620	383580	And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,
383580	387000	burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women
387000	390740	and saying, it's all right, it's a woman's penis.
390740	393860	So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.
393860	395780	Everyone born female is a woman,
395780	397500	everyone born male is a man,
397500	399700	trans women are predators who prey on women,
399700	402900	and I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.
402900	404380	Is this what you want, Joanne?
404380	406160	You wanna put the sorting hat on humanity
406160	408020	and divide us up into little houses?
408020	409140	Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor
409140	411060	trapped in a Hufflepuff's body?
411060	412420	What then, Joanne?
412420	413360	What then?
413360	416140	Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?
416140	417780	Well, if the tweet simply said,
417780	420940	I stand with Maya without further explanation,
420940	422860	you could give her the benefit of the doubt.
422860	425180	Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job
425180	427020	for having bigoted opinions,
427020	428980	even if she disagrees with those opinions.
428980	431020	But if that's all she was saying,
431020	433340	I wouldn't be making this video, would I?
433340	434740	The full tweet reads,
434740	438200	Dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.
438200	441140	Sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.
441140	444300	Live your best life in peace and security.
444300	446540	But force women out of their jobs
446540	448500	for stating that sex is real?
448500	451660	Hashtag I stand with Maya, hashtag this is not a drill.
451660	453860	Now I'm guessing that to most people,
453860	457220	this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.
457220	459480	It might even seem supportive of trans people,
459480	462700	since she said we're allowed to dress however we want
462700	466100	and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.
466100	467300	But there's a couple things about this
467300	468700	that don't sit right with me.
468700	470140	First is the phrase,
470140	474740	force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.
474740	478040	Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary
478040	480820	of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint,
480820	481660	namely,
481660	484060	I believe that it is impossible to change your sex
484060	485380	or to lose your sex.
485380	488180	Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men.
488180	491220	No change of clothes or hairstyle, no plastic surgery,
491220	493860	no accident or illness, no course of hormones,
493860	497020	no force of will or social conditioning, no declaration
497020	498980	can turn a female person into a male
498980	500860	or a male person into a female.
500860	502980	If Joanne had said Maya had been fired
502980	506460	for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman
506460	509500	and a person born female could never be a man,
509660	511260	that would've been more accurate,
511260	513340	but it would also sound contentious,
513340	515220	and obviously anti-trans.
515220	518540	Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present
518540	522180	Maya Forstater's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,
522180	523740	basic common sense,
523740	527460	which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.
527460	528980	Transphobes love to play this game
528980	531220	where they pretend that trans people
531220	534500	just don't understand basic biology, that's our problem.
534500	536580	As if I didn't start taking female hormones
536580	538380	because I'm acutely aware
538380	541140	that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body,
541140	542740	that sex is real.
542740	544940	You will never be a woman, Nathan.
544940	549300	Every cell in your body is male and has a Y chromosome.
549300	550380	Really?
550380	551220	That's crazy.
551220	553140	How'd you learn so much about science?
553140	554380	You know, I don't really feel the need
554380	555940	to have a second X chromosome.
555940	557220	I get by with one.
557220	558340	I make it work.
558340	559900	I actually like the Y chromosome.
559900	562020	I think it's a little more dainty, you know?
562020	565100	It's a little softer, a little more petite.
565100	567900	The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages,
567980	568820	don't you think?
568820	571060	And I don't need any more of those, thanks.
571060	572900	No trans person thinks it's possible
572900	574660	to change chromosomal sex,
574660	577540	and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.
577540	580500	When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,
580500	583260	we're talking about psychological and social identity.
583260	586020	So when transphobes say sex is real,
586020	587540	they're not actually contradicting
587540	591580	anything most trans people believe, except by implication.
591580	593820	When transphobes say sex is real,
593820	597220	what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.
597220	600380	They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,
600380	603380	which they trivialize, calling it dressing up,
603380	607060	fashion choices, whatever you wanna call yourself.
607060	610380	When Joanne says, dress however you please,
610380	612620	call yourself whatever you like,
612620	615580	she's belittling what it actually means to be trans,
615580	618020	reducing it to a change of name and costume.
618020	620620	It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.
620620	622780	For example, the homophobic equivalent
622780	624380	of Joanne's tweet might read,
624420	626940	Choose whatever lifestyle you want.
626940	630500	Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult
630500	632620	in the privacy of your own bedroom.
632620	634940	But force Christians out of their jobs
634940	638140	for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?
638140	640780	Hashtag I stand with Kim Davis.
640780	644380	A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.
644380	647980	Checkmate the gays, it's just science.
647980	650740	Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.
650740	653540	They refer to it as sexual preferences,
653540	657700	or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.
657700	658620	We don't tell straight people
658620	662260	to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.
662260	664660	Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.
664660	668260	Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.
668260	670740	It's also who you love.
670740	673500	It's part of who you are, part of your humanity,
673500	675540	and that's something that stays with you
675540	676920	outside of the bedroom.
676920	681460	So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.
681460	684380	Likewise, being trans is not a costume
684380	685940	I take off at the end of the night.
685940	688020	It's not a fashion choice.
688020	691260	It's not a pet name some people call me.
691260	694120	It's part of who I am as a person, you know?
694120	695900	It's part of my humanity,
695900	699580	and it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.
699580	702620	So telling trans people to dress however you want
702620	705420	is not really a supportive statement,
705420	709060	unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks
709060	711540	in their videos apologizing for being racist,
711540	715900	which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.
715900	717720	YouTubers are constantly dragging each other
717720	720880	because we see ourselves reflected in the other,
720880	722700	and we can't stand the sight of it.
722700	724540	So after the Maya Forrester tweet,
724540	727740	Joanne was silent about trans people for six months,
727740	730460	but she took up the cause again in June 2019,
730460	732260	first to complain about the use of the phrase
732260	734780	people who menstruate in the title of an article
734780	737620	trying to include trans men and non-binary people
737620	739620	in a discussion of period poverty.
739620	742140	That same night, presumably in response
742140	745020	to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers
745020	746620	who think Stalin did nothing wrong
746620	748420	but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,
748420	749660	Joanne tweeted a thread,
749660	752900	again repeating the slogan that sex is real, adding,
752900	755060	it isn't hate to speak the truth,
755060	758460	and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.
758460	762340	I respect every trans person's right to live any way
762340	765020	that feels authentic and comfortable to them.
765020	767580	I'd march with you if you were discriminated against
768340	770380	on the basis of being trans.
770380	772980	If you were discriminated against
772980	775300	on the basis of being trans?
775300	776220	If?
776220	778460	Widespread discrimination against trans people
778460	779820	is well-documented.
779820	782340	In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet,
782340	784100	the Trump administration removed
784100	786280	non-discrimination protections for trans people
786280	788260	in healthcare and health insurance.
788260	791060	So are you marching with us or not, Joanne?
791060	792540	There's a lot of stuff in these tweets
792540	795340	that might seem innocent enough to the average person,
795340	796660	but which to someone who understands
796660	800340	bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.
800340	802220	Bigotry always has a history,
802220	804300	and in order to understand bigotry,
804300	806020	you have to learn that history.
806020	809340	Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes,
809340	813260	narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing,
813260	814760	we have to learn them.
814760	817020	No one is born thinking that the gays
817020	818260	are destroying the family,
818260	820420	or that women are naturally subservient,
820420	823700	or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.
823700	826220	So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices,
826220	828700	you might not notice anything wrong with them.
828700	830660	He never said he hated the Jews,
830660	834100	he is simply concerned about the over-representation
834100	837440	of Jewish people in media and banking.
837440	840280	But if you're aware, woke, if you will,
840280	842020	then it kind of rings alarm bells
842020	845260	when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.
845260	847540	When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people
847540	849020	think sex isn't real,
849020	851300	and they're erasing same-sex attraction,
851300	853100	and they're silencing women,
853100	855820	alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these
856340	858300	familiar transphobic talking points,
858300	860940	specifically TERF talking points.
860940	864100	TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.
864100	865780	God, are we still talking about this?
865780	867820	I promise, this is the last time.
867820	872020	So TERFism is a, it's a hate movement
872020	875660	that disguises transphobia as feminism.
875660	877400	Bigotry has a history.
877400	880120	The foundational TERF text is feminist professor
880120	882500	Janice Raymond's 1979 book,
882540	886420	The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the Sh-tty Male,
886420	888420	in which Raymond argues that, quote,
888420	890960	All transsexuals rape women's bodies
890960	894000	by reducing the real female form to an artifact,
894000	896700	appropriating this body for themselves.
896700	899620	She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy
899620	902460	who, quote, merely cut off the most obvious means
902460	903780	of invading women.
903780	907180	This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,
907180	910380	and I bring this up because I wanna give you a sense
910420	912940	of how this kind of transphobe talks
912940	915540	when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.
915540	917780	Typical male narcissist,
917780	920340	Nathan manipulates his cultish audience
920340	924700	into thinking he's the victim of the big ol' meanie TERFs.
924700	926740	If you keep calling me Nathan,
926740	928460	I'm gonna call you Nigel.
929660	934100	Cheerio, old chap, or whatever you people say.
934100	936100	Here's the thing, Nigella.
936100	938420	Bigotry can be mean, yes,
938460	940500	and it usually is when bigots think
940500	942000	they can get away with it.
942000	945380	But it's vital to recognize that being mean
945380	947460	is not the essence of bigotry.
947460	949660	Bigotry can be hateful, yes,
949660	952020	but specifically, bigotry is hate
952020	955900	that poses a political threat to the target group.
955900	958220	The fundamental problem with TERFs
958220	959940	is not that they're mean,
959940	962380	it's that they're politically reactionary.
962380	965340	They wanna reverse the progress of trans liberation.
965340	967940	In the final chapter of The Transsexual Empire,
967980	970860	Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question.
970860	971700	Quote,
971700	974620	The problem of transsexualism would be best served
974620	978020	by morally mandating it out of existence.
978020	981500	I believe that the elimination of transsexualism
981500	984060	is not best achieved by legislation
984060	987220	prohibiting transsexual treatment and surgery,
987220	989960	but rather by legislation that limits it.
989960	992900	I would favor restricting the number of hospitals
992900	997020	and centers where transsexual surgery could be performed.
997020	1000060	The kind of counseling to pass successfully
1000060	1001900	as masculine or feminine
1001900	1004580	that now reigns in gender identity clinics
1004580	1008380	only reinforces the problem of transsexualism.
1008380	1009420	She goes on to argue
1009420	1013180	for alternative feminist consciousness-raising therapies,
1013180	1014020	admitting,
1014020	1015620	I am not so naive as to think
1015620	1018720	that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,
1018720	1021580	but they would at least pose the existence
1021580	1024740	of a real alternative to be explored and tried.
1024780	1026300	So like homophobes,
1026300	1028460	TERFs have historically advocated
1028460	1030620	a kind of conversion therapy
1030620	1034060	aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.
1034060	1035980	And like the anti-abortion movement,
1035980	1039080	they recognize it's not yet politically practical
1039080	1041740	to completely make illegal a medical procedure
1041740	1042920	they don't like,
1042920	1044980	so they settle for making it as difficult
1044980	1046740	as possible to get one.
1046740	1049460	In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report
1049460	1051480	to the Department of Health and Human Services
1051480	1053980	repeating her arguments against transsexualism,
1053980	1056340	which was cited in a 1981 decision
1056340	1058020	that Medicare would not cover
1058020	1059700	transition-related healthcare.
1059700	1063060	That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.
1063060	1065660	So there's real political consequences to bigotry.
1065660	1067940	It's not just a matter of being mean.
1067940	1070940	Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.
1070940	1072460	Unlike Janice Raymond,
1072460	1075040	J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced
1075040	1077580	and very intent on convincing all of us
1077580	1080960	that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally
1080960	1083420	who loves and supports trans people,
1083420	1087260	while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.
1087260	1089260	She's constantly saying things like,
1089260	1091380	I know and love trans people,
1091380	1095100	but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against
1095100	1096740	on the basis of being trans.
1096740	1098420	At the same time,
1098420	1100460	none of the gender-critical women I've talked to
1100460	1102140	hates trans people.
1102140	1103180	On the contrary,
1103180	1105060	many of them became interested in this issue
1105060	1108380	in the first place out of concern for trans youth.
1108380	1110280	A lot of people have a hard time noticing
1110280	1111620	this kind of bigotry,
1111620	1113460	and I think one reason for that
1113460	1116880	is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.
1116880	1119980	People think of bigotry as like judging a group
1119980	1121540	instead of an individual,
1121540	1124380	which is of course a horrible thing to do.
1124380	1126060	I don't care for the English.
1126060	1128420	There's sick, sick people.
1128420	1131020	Or people think of bigotry as hate,
1131020	1133140	something inhuman and monstrous.
1133140	1135180	So when people hear the word bigot,
1135180	1138700	they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,
1138700	1142660	some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.
1142660	1144180	But the problem with the Nazis
1144180	1147100	was not that they hated love and friendship.
1147100	1150760	They believed they were defending German blood and soil
1150760	1154860	against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.
1154860	1156740	And what were we supposed to do?
1156740	1160580	Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?
1160580	1162740	That's how a Nazi actually thinks, right?
1162740	1164820	It's not that they hate friendship.
1164820	1166940	No, they have their own internal logic
1166940	1169460	of victimization and self-righteousness.
1169460	1173420	So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,
1173420	1177340	you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.
1177340	1179060	You know, sometimes people criticize me
1179060	1181140	for empathizing with bigots,
1181140	1184300	but I believe that understanding bigots
1184300	1188080	is the best defense against becoming one yourself.
1188080	1191180	Because when you dehumanize the villains,
1191180	1195260	you become unable to recognize the villain within.
1195300	1196700	How is she, though?
1196700	1198980	She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.
1198980	1201180	Metal straw because I love the environment.
1201180	1203540	I'm so good, I'm really fucking good.
1203540	1205980	The idea that bigotry is simply hate
1205980	1209740	I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.
1209740	1212900	It's the idea that bigots are people who outright say,
1212900	1215540	we hate you, God hates you,
1215540	1217380	and we're all marching around with signs
1217380	1218900	about how much we hate you,
1218900	1221940	like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.
1221940	1222860	Taylor Swift.
1222860	1225100	Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.
1225940	1226780	Well, I don't.
1226780	1228100	I don't want to be a gay icon,
1228100	1230620	I'm just stuck with you people.
1230620	1231460	Just kidding.
1231460	1234140	Shade never made anybody less gay.
1234140	1235940	This isn't Shade, Taylor.
1235940	1238620	Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,
1238620	1242500	sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.
1242500	1245520	Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.
1245520	1247820	And the video for You Need to Calm Down
1247820	1250700	is just so emblematic of this misconception.
1250700	1253340	Taylor takes the subject of homophobia
1253380	1256740	and turns it into yet another song about haters.
1256740	1258060	But in the real world,
1258060	1260100	backwoods hillbillies stomping around
1260100	1264020	with misspelled signs are not really the problem.
1264020	1267140	The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated
1267140	1268700	and powerful people.
1268700	1270940	And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes
1270940	1272620	who say it's an abomination,
1272620	1274300	these perverts are spreading AIDS,
1274300	1275580	they're destroying the family,
1275580	1276940	they're recruiting children.
1276940	1279940	But these days it's much more common to hear,
1279940	1282300	of course I love gay people,
1282300	1285660	some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction.
1285660	1289740	But it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology
1289740	1293560	promoted in schools to children as young as three years old.
1293560	1297220	Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.
1297220	1299500	I'm a good convincing homophobe, don't I?
1299500	1302460	There's really two different styles of bigotry.
1302460	1304300	They express the same prejudice,
1304300	1307020	but they're very different in tone.
1307020	1309540	I'll call the two styles direct bigotry
1309540	1310940	and indirect bigotry.
1310940	1313340	Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.
1313340	1315700	It's a bigotry manifested in slurs
1315700	1317220	and outright discrimination
1317220	1319100	and demonizing the target group
1319100	1322860	and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.
1322860	1326780	Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern
1326780	1330020	or debate about a host of proxy issues.
1330020	1333540	It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.
1333540	1335340	Frequently the claim is that a once-needed
1335340	1337860	liberation movement has now gone too far,
1337860	1340780	but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors
1341620	1342460	who are disturbing law and order
1342460	1344220	with violent and chaotic protests,
1344220	1346780	who are victimizing and silencing innocent people
1346780	1348060	by calling them bigots,
1348060	1349580	who are infiltrating the media
1349580	1351820	and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment
1351820	1354020	with politically correct propaganda.
1354020	1356880	And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated
1356880	1358140	to speak out against it
1358140	1360340	because cancel culture is out of control
1360340	1362500	and free speech is under attack.
1362500	1365260	The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,
1365260	1369140	ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders,
1369220	1374220	rapists, brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.
1374780	1378940	Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,
1378940	1380900	always a knight in shining armor,
1380900	1383220	defending women, defending the children,
1383220	1385420	defending marriage, defending freedom,
1385420	1388180	defending the family, defending our values,
1388180	1390660	defending common sense, defending tradition,
1390660	1393040	defending civilization itself,
1394180	1396300	defending God.
1396300	1398640	He's all powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.
1399120	1399960	I think a lot of people
1399960	1402840	take a borderline heroic view of themselves,
1402840	1406440	and indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.
1406440	1410240	Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets
1410240	1412880	with some big abstract concept.
1412880	1414440	Instead of Jewish people,
1414440	1417720	they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.
1417720	1420880	Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis,
1420880	1422340	or the friend zone.
1422340	1425920	Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.
1425960	1429040	Trans people become transgenderism,
1429040	1432320	gender ideology, transactivists.
1432320	1435040	What they're really against is equality,
1435040	1436280	but they don't say that.
1436280	1438960	In fact, they may not even think it.
1438960	1440740	But they tell on themselves
1440740	1443320	when they react with instinctive hostility
1443320	1445600	to anyone who agitates for change.
1445600	1449480	It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs
1449480	1452360	shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.
1452360	1454840	A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices
1454880	1458120	by Elizabeth Young-Bruhl really helped me with this video.
1458120	1459520	One of the points she makes
1459520	1463360	is that a lot of the time, bigotry is backlash.
1463360	1466600	Ideologies of desire are, generally,
1466600	1469720	backlashes against movements of equality.
1469720	1471920	They are regressive prejudices
1471920	1475280	that reinstate inequalities and distinctions
1475280	1478840	when the force of movements for equality has been registered
1478840	1482000	and, often unconsciously, rejected.
1482000	1485800	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1485800	1488680	Bigotry is not just the psychological state
1488680	1490720	of hating a group of people.
1490720	1492560	Bigotry is political.
1492560	1496040	It's a reaction to changing demographics
1496040	1497840	or to liberation movements
1497840	1500760	or to changing power relations between groups.
1500760	1504400	A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women
1504400	1506440	in the literal psychological sense.
1506440	1509480	It's more that they feel threatened
1509480	1511520	by the prospect of the social
1511520	1513560	and political equality of women.
1513560	1516760	In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened
1516760	1520120	is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry,
1520120	1522680	much more so than feeling hateful.
1522680	1525000	So bigotry is reactive,
1525000	1527720	and it changes along with the circumstances
1527720	1529160	it's a reaction to.
1529160	1532600	1950s misogyny still has some things in common
1532600	1534200	with 2020s misogyny.
1534200	1536880	For example, a lot of men still feel some need
1536880	1540080	to control women's sexuality and women's bodies,
1540080	1542800	but it's also changed a lot as gender relations
1542800	1545360	have shifted in the last 70 years.
1545360	1547300	The idea that women are naturally suited
1547300	1549800	to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent
1549800	1550760	than it used to be.
1550760	1554160	And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder,
1554160	1555840	because in the last decade,
1555840	1559000	trans liberation has increased our visibility.
1559000	1560920	People are running into us at work now.
1560920	1562920	They're having to use our pronouns.
1562920	1565580	They're seeing us in politics or in media,
1565580	1568140	and not just as laughingstocks or monsters
1568140	1570740	like we used to be, but as actual characters.
1570740	1574380	And a lot of people are not very happy about it.
1574380	1576780	They feel threatened.
1576780	1578940	That must be super fucking hard for you.
1578940	1582980	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1582980	1585700	So J.K. Rowling frames her position as,
1585700	1589260	I am just saying the fact that sex is real.
1589260	1591780	It's not hateful to say a fact.
1591780	1594140	Why is everyone so mad at me?
1594140	1596500	A fact can't be bigoted.
1596500	1600620	And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted,
1600620	1604780	but a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.
1604780	1606980	Usually when we discuss facts,
1606980	1609900	we're using those facts to tell a story.
1609900	1614140	And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.
1614140	1617120	You know, suppose someone tweets the fact
1617120	1618820	that the homicide rate is higher
1618820	1621420	for black Americans than white Americans.
1621420	1624540	I'm gonna ask, what story are you trying
1624540	1626340	to tell with this fact?
1626340	1629620	What political goal are you trying to support?
1629620	1631980	One way indirect bigotry works
1631980	1635100	is by camouflaging political struggles
1635100	1637940	as intellectual debates.
1637940	1640660	When Joanne says sex is real,
1640660	1643460	she sounds like she's staking out a position
1643460	1647420	in the trans debate, which is then presented
1647420	1649420	as an intellectual conflict
1649420	1651460	about the metaphysics of gender,
1651460	1652940	instead of what it really is,
1652940	1655020	which is a political conflict
1655020	1658660	about the social equality of transgender people.
1658660	1661020	And the effectiveness of that strategy
1661020	1663380	is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan
1663380	1666460	of the slogan trans women are women.
1666460	1667920	And this is just my opinion,
1667920	1669940	I don't speak for any other trans people,
1669940	1672020	but there's a couple things I don't like about it.
1672020	1675260	One is trans men and non-binary people matter
1675260	1676900	just as much as trans women.
1676900	1678060	Which you don't as often hear,
1678060	1683060	trans men are men, or non-binary people are...
1684700	1685620	valid?
1687260	1688820	Doesn't really work, does it?
1688820	1691220	The other problem with trans women are women
1691220	1694300	is it tends to invite the response,
1694300	1696460	well, what does it even mean to be a woman?
1696460	1697940	Define womanhood.
1697940	1700660	And now you're immediately getting baited
1700660	1702860	into some bullshit semantic debate
1702860	1705460	about what is a real woman.
1705460	1706580	A real woman.
1707260	1708500	How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?
1708500	1710180	What if you're in the Matrix right now,
1710180	1712860	and in the real world, you're biologically male?
1712860	1714620	The tables are turned.
1714620	1716820	It doesn't really matter, does it?
1716820	1720440	This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.
1720440	1722900	You know, I've been down this road too many times already,
1722900	1725940	and I always end up having these dead-end conversations
1725940	1727420	about gender performativity,
1727420	1729580	or worse, conversations about what it means
1729580	1730940	to feel like a woman.
1730940	1733260	Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.
1733260	1735700	I don't think anyone feels like a woman, honestly,
1735700	1738780	except a certain sub-genre of gay men,
1738780	1740580	and possibly Shania Twain.
1740580	1742700	Probably not even her anymore, honestly.
1742700	1744500	Not since the early 2000s.
1744500	1746900	You know, some questions should be dissolved
1746900	1748180	rather than solved.
1748180	1749580	That's what Wittgenstein said.
1749580	1751580	That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.
1751580	1753740	Sometimes the only way to answer a question
1753740	1756740	is to realize you're asking the wrong question.
1756740	1758980	How do I know I'm a woman?
1758980	1759820	Well, look at me.
1759820	1764020	Oh, I rest my case.
1764500	1766780	The monitor's over here.
1766780	1768900	That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.
1768900	1771780	I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.
1771780	1774060	Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves
1774060	1775060	what gender is.
1775060	1777380	In fact, if you even try to answer the question,
1777380	1779660	you end up enraging some part of the community
1779660	1781100	who feels excluded.
1781100	1782460	So no, trans people are not trying
1782460	1784620	to force an ideology on people.
1784620	1787460	We don't even share an ideology within our own community.
1787460	1790620	What we share are a common set of political struggles
1790620	1793740	against discrimination, against harassment,
1794460	1796700	against excessive medical gatekeeping,
1796700	1799140	against exclusion from public life.
1799140	1803500	So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?
1803500	1806780	Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people
1806780	1810500	and something that evades pointless philosophizing
1810500	1815260	about biology and what is gender and who is true trans
1815260	1817060	and what is a woman really.
1817060	1819460	Something that centers what actually matters,
1819460	1821260	which is freeing trans people
1821260	1823180	from the stigma and discrimination
1823180	1824940	that have historically prevented us
1824940	1827060	from becoming equal members of society.
1827060	1830420	So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s,
1830420	1834860	but I personally like the slogan trans liberation now.
1834860	1836540	It's short, it's sweet,
1836540	1839340	and instead of prompting define women at it,
1839340	1842620	it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?
1842620	1844300	Liberation from what?
1844300	1846980	And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.
1846980	1849180	And now you're talking about politics
1849180	1851100	instead of talking about semantics.
1851100	1852460	Isn't that better?
1852460	1854860	I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed
1854860	1857460	with reassuring ourselves that we are valid
1857460	1859820	that we sometimes forget that the end goal
1859820	1864300	of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.
1864300	1866400	That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.
1866400	1870060	So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,
1870060	1872980	which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?
1872980	1874580	Well, maybe I care a little bit.
1874580	1876500	But instead, why don't we ask,
1876500	1880660	is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?
1880660	1883180	Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?
1883180	1884460	Isn't it so much better
1884460	1887300	to have a concrete political project in front of you
1887300	1891180	instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?
1891180	1894140	Trans people are a population of people
1894140	1895740	who have a right to equality
1895740	1897580	and to freedom from discrimination.
1897580	1901060	We are not an ideology that's up for debate.
1901060	1904860	But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.
1904860	1907780	Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,
1907780	1911300	but as an ideology that she disagrees with.
1911300	1914660	I'm just saying that sex is real.
1914660	1916700	Is that all you're saying, Joanne?
1916700	1919200	♪♪♪
1930380	1932460	Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire
1932460	1934020	in the prefect's bathroom?
1934020	1936740	Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?
1936740	1939060	I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.
1939060	1940700	This bath is actually really nice.
1940700	1943660	It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil,
1943660	1945980	Epsom salts, just kind of everything
1945980	1947900	that's good in baths all together.
1947900	1949460	I don't wanna talk about bigotry.
1949460	1951140	I wanna talk about baths.
1951140	1954620	Can this just be a video about baths from now on?
1954620	1956140	Oh, fine, I'll do my job.
1956140	1959580	On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,
1959580	1962100	which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,
1962100	1964740	which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC
1964740	1968420	for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.
1968420	1969900	The essay is several pages long
1969900	1972340	and outlines her reasons for speaking out
1972340	1974300	on sex and gender issues.
1974300	1976500	I refuse to bow down to a movement
1976500	1978700	that I believe is doing demonstrable harm
1978700	1981620	in seeking to erode women as a political
1981620	1984940	and biological class and offering to cover predators
1984940	1986260	like few before it.
1986260	1987820	Where do I even begin with this one?
1987820	1990740	Well, let's pick some highlights.
1990740	1992540	Woman is not a costume.
1992580	1995900	Woman is not an idea in a man's head.
1995900	1998220	Woman is not a pink brain.
1998220	1999940	My liking for Jimmy Choo's
1999940	2002660	or any of the other sexist ideas
2002660	2005700	now somehow touted as progressive.
2005700	2007900	Oh, well, my mistake.
2007900	2010020	Here I was, thinking I was a woman.
2010020	2012380	It turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.
2012380	2014340	What a whimsical misunderstanding.
2014340	2016220	Okay, well, that's it, everyone.
2016220	2017260	The channel's over.
2017260	2018860	Thanks for the likes and comments.
2018860	2021940	I'm gonna head out now to the Jimmy Choo store
2021940	2025020	and I guess I'll cut my tits off.
2026420	2030740	Joanne, Joanne, this is madness, Joanne.
2030740	2032940	When you throw open the doors of bathrooms
2032940	2035460	and changing rooms to any man who believes
2035460	2038660	or feels he's a woman, and as I've said,
2038660	2041540	gender confirmation certificates may now be granted
2041540	2044420	without any need for surgery or hormones,
2044420	2047740	then you open the door to any and all men
2047740	2049660	who wish to come inside.
2049660	2051980	So look, I understand that some women are anxious
2051980	2054140	about the thought of predators in bathrooms.
2054140	2056660	And believe me, I don't wanna share a bathroom
2056660	2058460	with a predator any more than you do.
2058460	2061020	Why are all my rose petals on this one side?
2061020	2062580	Some of them need to come over here.
2062580	2063540	Come here.
2063540	2065260	I've redistributed the petals.
2066140	2067500	Socialist icon.
2067500	2069260	But this talking point that gender change
2069260	2071300	on legal documents will enable predators
2071300	2074120	to enter bathrooms, it doesn't really make sense
2074120	2077020	because gender policing in public bathrooms
2077020	2079260	doesn't involve legal documents.
2079500	2081180	When was the last time you had to present
2081180	2083560	a gender certificate to gain admittance
2083560	2084900	to a public bathroom?
2084900	2086980	This feels like a strangely outdated conversation
2086980	2089260	to be having during pandemic lockdown.
2089260	2091100	Imagine using a public bathroom.
2091100	2092880	Imagine being in public.
2092880	2095380	I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,
2095380	2097580	which is about the experiences of butch women.
2097580	2100340	And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,
2100340	2102100	which describes how women's bathrooms
2102100	2105340	tend to operate as an area for the enforcement
2105340	2106980	of gender conformity.
2106980	2109660	The author, Jack Halberstam, who's assigned female
2109660	2111540	at birth and presents masculine,
2111540	2114420	describes routinely having security called on him
2114420	2116220	for using the women's bathroom.
2116220	2119340	Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom
2119340	2121500	is a frequent occurrence in the lives
2121500	2124100	of many androgynous or masculine women.
2124100	2127300	Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders
2127300	2128860	whether the category woman,
2128860	2131200	when used to designate public functions,
2131200	2133020	is completely outmoded.
2133020	2135800	Queer literature is littered with references
2135800	2137720	to the bathroom problem,
2137720	2140200	and it would not be an exaggeration to call it
2140200	2143040	a standard feature of the butch narrative.
2143040	2144160	And that's very interesting to me
2144160	2146680	because as a feminine trans woman,
2146680	2148680	I have not once been questioned
2148680	2150240	or had the authorities called on me
2150240	2152080	in a women's public bathroom
2152080	2154040	in the entire time I've been using them,
2154040	2155880	which is several years now.
2155880	2159620	So when Joanne Ruling, a feminine heterosexual woman,
2159620	2161680	calls for more bathroom policing
2161680	2164480	to protect the lesbians or whatever,
2164480	2166160	it just seems ignorant
2166160	2168520	of the way bathroom policing actually works.
2168520	2170720	Like, is she just so famous
2170720	2172720	that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore
2172720	2174480	and she forgot how they work?
2174480	2177640	How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?
2177640	2178820	$10?
2178820	2181680	Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,
2181680	2184280	not chromosomes, and there's no practical way
2184280	2187480	to change that short of stationing a genital inspector
2187480	2189000	in every stall, you know,
2189000	2191640	just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.
2192480	2196360	That's a very good idea, Joanne.
2196360	2199240	That's very good.
2199240	2202880	Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.
2202880	2205360	They include trans men in their feminism
2205360	2207520	because they were born women.
2207520	2211780	Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists
2211780	2214720	think that trans men are women?
2214720	2217640	Hello, operator, could you get me Alanis Morissette?
2217640	2219720	I have a new incident to report.
2219720	2223080	So look, I could keep refuting points made in Turf Wars,
2223080	2224400	which is basically just a series
2224400	2226000	of common transphobic canards
2226000	2227640	we've all heard a hundred times before,
2227640	2230520	but I want to focus in particular on some passages
2230520	2231920	that I think are very revealing
2231920	2234080	about the psychology of transphobia.
2234080	2236240	What is it about the transgenders
2236240	2238520	that some people feel threatened by?
2238520	2241160	Well, Joanne Rowling gives us a lot to work with
2241160	2242600	in answering that question.
2242600	2243840	You know, Joanne being a TERF
2243840	2245840	is mostly terrible for trans people,
2245840	2248060	but maybe the silver lining
2248060	2250420	is that the most famous novelist in the world
2250420	2253000	having a public transphobic breakdown
2253000	2255420	is providing a wealth of insight
2255420	2258000	about the interior world of a transphobe.
2258000	2260220	In Turf Wars, Joanne claims her interest
2260220	2264060	in the trans issue is intensely personal,
2264060	2266020	and she has two reasons why it's personal.
2266020	2269500	The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,
2269500	2271100	she would have been transed.
2271100	2272380	Someone would have transed her.
2272380	2275220	You know, people are being transed left and right these days.
2275220	2277140	It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.
2277180	2279100	Trans people, we're always on the lookout
2279100	2281140	for the next person we can trans.
2281140	2283860	That's all we wanna do, is trans people.
2283860	2288020	I transed four people this morning before I ate breakfast.
2288020	2289940	She thinks that she would have been recruited
2289940	2292920	by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones
2292920	2295380	by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.
2295380	2297060	And in support of this speculation,
2297060	2299300	Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes
2299300	2301220	about social contagion, and to quote,
2301220	2304700	4,400% increase in girls being referred
2304700	2306220	for transitioning treatment.
2306220	2308060	And that sounds pretty alarming, right?
2308060	2309820	4,400%.
2309820	2312500	But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,
2312500	2316420	only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred.
2316420	2320200	And by last year, that number was 1,740,
2320200	2322580	with the biggest increase happening five years ago.
2322580	2325260	You know, the transgender tipping point year.
2325260	2327700	So that is a big increase, but it corresponds
2327700	2330420	to the biggest ever increase in trans visibility.
2330420	2332020	So it does make sense,
2332020	2334860	and there's 11 million children in the UK,
2334860	2337940	so let's say 5.5 million girls,
2337940	2342940	and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.
2343060	2345540	And considering that around 1% of adults
2345540	2349660	are some kind of transgender, 0.03% of kids
2349660	2352420	is not really an alarming number to me.
2352420	2354900	If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.
2354900	2357020	But part of Joanne's problem here
2357020	2359340	is that she seems not to really understand
2359340	2361060	what being trans is.
2361060	2363540	The writings of young trans men reveal a group
2363540	2365620	of notably sensitive and clever people.
2365620	2369080	The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,
2369080	2371940	with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,
2371940	2376620	dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm, and self-hatred,
2376620	2378300	the more I've wondered whether
2378300	2380660	if I'd been born 30 years later,
2380660	2382820	I too might have tried to transition.
2382820	2386020	The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.
2386020	2388740	If I had found community and sympathy online
2388740	2391220	that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,
2391220	2393100	I believe I could have been persuaded
2393620	2395500	to turn myself into the son my father
2395500	2398060	had openly said he'd have preferred.
2398060	2401180	Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness
2401180	2403460	and my ambivalence about being a woman
2403460	2407180	reflected in the work of female writers and musicians
2407180	2409880	who reassured me that in spite of everything,
2409880	2413500	a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.
2413500	2416020	It's fine not to feel pink, frilly,
2416020	2417880	and compliant inside your own head.
2417880	2420580	It's okay to feel confused, dark,
2420580	2423060	both sexual and non-sexual,
2423060	2426380	unsure of what or who you are.
2426380	2430180	Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here,
2430180	2431820	and let's start by making a list
2431820	2435340	of things being a transgender man is not.
2435340	2438420	Having anxiety, having dissociation,
2438420	2441500	having an eating disorder, doing self-harm,
2441500	2443760	doing self-hatred, a viable way
2443760	2446260	to make your sexist father proud,
2446260	2449300	not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,
2449300	2453060	not being compliant, feeling confused,
2453060	2457140	feeling dark, feeling sexual,
2457140	2461660	feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.
2461660	2464020	Okay, so you can be a trans man
2464020	2467260	and experience some or even all of these things,
2467260	2471460	but none of these things are what being a trans man is.
2471460	2474900	Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body
2474900	2477540	and literally live your life as a man
2477540	2479820	is not the same as the typical struggles
2479820	2481060	other girls go through.
2481060	2483140	Joanne is projecting her own memories
2483140	2485620	of troubled adolescence onto trans men,
2485620	2487980	and then saying, oh, clearly they were going
2487980	2489340	through the same things I was,
2489340	2492980	just someone persuaded them to transition.
2492980	2494900	It's a limitation of human empathy
2494900	2497660	that sometimes when we're trying to understand
2497660	2499420	what someone else is feeling,
2499420	2503660	the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them,
2503660	2506220	and sometimes that's a misrepresentation.
2506220	2508740	Sometimes other people are experiencing things
2508740	2510900	that we have never experienced.
2512300	2515220	So we have to invent explanations
2515220	2518740	about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.
2518740	2521580	Someone is persuading them to transition.
2521580	2523420	But this fear-mongering about kids
2523420	2527580	being persuaded to transition is just not how things work.
2527580	2529220	From the way transphobes talk about it,
2529220	2531380	you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground
2531380	2534560	picks up a toy truck, an endocrinologist pops out
2534600	2536160	from behind a tree and says,
2536160	2538560	we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.
2538560	2540520	Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.
2541520	2544240	But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,
2544240	2547240	in particular about young transmasculine people.
2547240	2550240	Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out
2550240	2552640	that is essentially to transmasculine people
2552640	2555360	what the transsexual empire was to trans women.
2555360	2557960	It's called Irreversible Damage,
2557960	2561760	The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.
2561760	2563320	Chapter one.
2563360	2564600	A contagion.
2564600	2565480	Jesus.
2565480	2568020	Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?
2568020	2570640	The argument is that female-to-male transgenderism
2570640	2572880	is an infectious social disease,
2572880	2574520	which is literally the argument
2574520	2578420	Hitler made about homosexuality, but okay, great.
2578420	2581600	I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues
2581600	2583520	is that not enough attention is paid
2583520	2586200	to transphobia against trans men.
2586200	2588220	Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,
2588220	2590120	Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,
2590120	2592040	transgender women are women,
2592040	2593540	and that's very nice of him,
2593540	2597080	but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.
2597080	2600160	In fact, she spends more words on trans men
2600160	2601640	than on any other topic,
2601640	2604600	so I think it's worth looking in particular at that.
2604600	2608340	Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men
2608340	2611440	is not the same as transphobia against trans women.
2611440	2612780	There's a lot of similarities,
2612780	2615160	but they're really two different prejudices,
2615160	2617600	and they come from different psychological places,
2617600	2619280	in the same way that lesbophobia
2619280	2621720	is different from homophobia against gay men.
2621720	2623160	For trans women, I would say
2623160	2625520	the distinctive experience of transphobia
2625520	2627840	is being simultaneously treated
2627840	2631020	as a pornographic female fetish object
2631020	2634040	and as a dangerous male predator.
2634040	2637400	The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus
2637400	2640720	who will ravage your wife and trap your husband.
2640720	2642960	Your polygamous commune will be devastated.
2642960	2644760	Whereas I feel like transmasculine people
2644760	2648920	are less vilified, but so infantilized.
2648920	2651520	I guess transphobes view trans men as women,
2652320	2654840	a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,
2654840	2657040	so much for transitioning to escape sexism.
2657040	2661520	The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls
2661520	2663480	can't possibly decide for themselves
2663480	2665200	what to do with their own bodies,
2665200	2667560	so the courts must intervene to take control,
2667560	2669960	which is exactly what just happened in the UK,
2669960	2672080	where trans youth under 16 will now need
2672080	2674040	not only the approval of a doctor,
2674040	2675680	but will need to seek a court order
2675680	2677480	in order to get puberty blockers.
2677480	2679280	And the justification given for this
2679280	2682600	mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns
2682600	2685760	about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls
2685760	2688240	being unable to make informed decisions.
2688240	2689920	In her essay, Joanne says,
2689920	2693200	I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman
2693200	2695920	who's older than I am and wonderful.
2695920	2698400	Although she's open about her past as a gay man,
2698400	2700240	I've always found it hard to think of her
2700240	2701960	as anything other than a woman.
2701960	2703880	Being older, though, she went through
2703880	2707120	a long and rigorous process of evaluation,
2707120	2710000	psychotherapy, and staged transformation.
2710000	2712160	The current explosion of trans activism
2712160	2716160	is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems
2716160	2718720	through which candidates for sex reassignment
2718720	2720240	were once required to pass.
2720240	2721560	So that's what she wants.
2721560	2725320	She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,
2725320	2727720	which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,
2727720	2730280	just Joanne's more polite about it.
2730280	2731440	I want to make a drink.
2731640	2732480	Oh, fuck.
2735640	2737600	Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.
2737600	2739280	No, just drank a lot.
2739280	2741240	Ugh, we're revealing leg again.
2741240	2742120	The scandal.
2742120	2745840	Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it
2745840	2748360	is that much more chaste.
2748360	2750480	Well, I'm an extremely chaste woman.
2750480	2752800	I try to honor God with my body.
2752800	2754760	That's why I got a sex change.
2754760	2757680	I'm honoring God with my sex change.
2757680	2758880	I'm not drunk enough for this.
2758880	2761920	So I also want to point out that cis men and cis women
2761920	2764600	are often transphobic for different reasons.
2764600	2767560	A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women
2767560	2771120	because the thought that a man can become a woman
2771120	2773800	threatens the certainty of their own manhood.
2773800	2775720	It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men
2775720	2776920	are homophobic.
2776920	2780320	They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.
2780320	2781520	And of course, a lot of straight men
2781520	2782960	are attracted to trans women,
2782960	2785280	and they feel that that attraction threatens
2785280	2787440	their identity as straight men.
2787440	2790320	Back in my comp hat days when I dated men,
2790320	2792680	for a couple straight guys I hooked up with,
2792680	2796040	going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.
2796040	2797440	This is it, Mr. Frodo.
2797440	2798960	If I take one more step,
2798960	2801720	I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.
2801720	2804800	Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.
2804800	2807720	And afterwards, they go into this whole Cartesian spiral.
2807720	2809080	What have I done?
2809080	2810400	What does this mean?
2810400	2811320	Who am I?
2811320	2813220	I think for a lot of cis women,
2813220	2815840	the very existence of trans men
2815840	2818440	sends them into a similar identity crisis.
2818440	2820880	I think a lot of women have had to fight
2820880	2823000	a really difficult internal battle
2823000	2824960	to make peace with their own womanhood.
2824960	2827860	And for some women, confronting the existence
2827860	2832480	of transgender people seems to open some old wounds.
2832480	2834000	Like I've noticed in particular
2834000	2837160	that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs
2837160	2841480	are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.
2841480	2843880	And these women see hyperfeminine trans women
2843880	2846120	in makeup and dresses, and they say,
2846120	2848880	that is not what being a woman is.
2848880	2851640	I've had to fight for my own identity
2851640	2855040	against the idea that that's what being a woman is.
2855040	2857300	These are just misogynistic stereotypes.
2857300	2859560	You are a parody of womanhood.
2859560	2860760	You're a fetishist.
2860760	2863180	And when they see trans men, they say,
2863180	2864320	you're a traitor.
2864320	2865720	You're a self-loather.
2865720	2868200	Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman
2868200	2869760	the way I've had to?
2869760	2872120	But this is all projection and misunderstanding.
2872120	2874960	Trans women do not think that wearing dresses
2874960	2876540	is what makes us women.
2876540	2879640	And trans men do not think that not feeling pink,
2879640	2882760	frilly, and compliant is what makes them men.
2882760	2885480	These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning
2885480	2888120	to trans people's actions in her own brain,
2888120	2889920	because she perceives our lives
2889920	2892440	as some kind of commentary on gender,
2892440	2895400	with an implied ideology about what it means
2895400	2896920	to be a man or a woman.
2896920	2899180	But that's your interpretation, Joanne.
2899180	2902180	That's a meaning that you are imposing on us,
2902180	2905660	because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage
2905660	2908740	of your own, and it's interfering with your ability
2908740	2911340	to genuinely empathize with trans people.
2911340	2912700	You know, at the end of your essay,
2912700	2915820	you say that you never forget the inner complexity
2915820	2917440	when it comes to trans people.
2917440	2918800	And that's a nice thought,
2918800	2922540	but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people
2922540	2926140	as some kind of abstract theory of gender,
2926140	2929140	or as a projection of your own adolescence,
2929980	2932860	then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals
2932860	2935260	with our own experiences and stories.
2935260	2938660	And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson
2938660	2941500	on trans people, sorry, gender issues,
2941500	2943060	I think it would be good if you listened
2943060	2946820	to the experiences of trans men without, for instance,
2946820	2950060	superimposing your own troubled relationship
2950060	2951140	with your father.
2951140	2954060	I should probably talk about the book,
2954060	2957220	since I did go to the trouble to read all 900 pages,
2957220	2960260	because unlike certain other YouTubers,
2960260	2962300	I do in fact know how to read.
2962300	2965220	Troubled Blood was published in September 2020
2965220	2968540	by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.
2968540	2970460	You know, for someone apparently so concerned
2970460	2973900	about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,
2973900	2977580	the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is,
2977580	2978740	it's interesting.
2978740	2980320	It's a choice.
2980320	2981580	God, this thing is huge.
2981580	2983660	It's like the infinite jest of terfory.
2983660	2986380	So Troubled Blood is a detective novel
2986380	2989340	about the simmering heterosexual tension
2989340	2991140	between two investigators.
2991140	2993420	And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?
2993420	2994540	Simmering.
2994540	2997100	There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe,
2997100	3000660	and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

3043540	3045420	Get out of here, Daniel.
3045420	3047700	This is a final farewell to my heterosexuality.
3047700	3048860	Goodbye, Daniel!
3050420	3051900	And your little arm, too.
3053380	3054780	You stay out of this, Linda.
3054780	3058180	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
3058180	3061940	So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,
3061940	3065180	a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman
3065180	3068180	to lull his victims, whom he abducts,
3068180	3070980	tortures, rapes, and murders.
3070980	3071980	Interesting.
3071980	3075780	Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,
3075780	3078340	I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.
3078340	3081100	But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,
3081100	3083260	have called this book transphobic.
3083260	3084460	And you might think that's unfair
3084460	3089140	since the character Dennis Creed, this serial killer,
3089140	3092020	is a, he's not a trans, he's a cross-dresser.
3092020	3094060	This has nothing to do with trans people.
3094060	3096300	Why so triggered, snowflake?
3096300	3098500	Well, precious, there's a couple things
3098500	3100940	I think are worth taking into consideration here.
3100940	3104900	One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer
3104900	3106660	is an old transphobic trope.
3106660	3109180	It's a cliche that goes back decades.
3109180	3111780	And I take great offense to the suggestion
3111780	3113900	that trans women are serial killers
3113900	3117780	because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.
3117780	3120300	The trope seems to originate in 1960
3120300	3122260	with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
3122260	3124460	That's just my guess, though, I haven't researched this.
3124460	3126100	Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?
3126860	3128140	So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.
3128140	3130700	The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up
3130700	3132180	where the psychiatrist offers
3132180	3134260	the pseudo-Freudian explanation
3134260	3136940	that Norman Cross-dresses because the personality
3136940	3138700	of his dead mother takes over
3138700	3140940	and out of jealousy, kills the women
3140940	3142500	Norman is attracted to.
3142500	3145140	Therefore, the psychiatrist explains,
3145140	3148140	Norman is not a real transvestite.
3148140	3150340	You're a fake transvestite, Norman.
3150340	3151620	Trender alert.
3151620	3152980	But I do think that even if Psycho
3152980	3154660	isn't explicitly transphobic,
3154660	3157380	movies can subconsciously implant ideas
3157380	3159940	and feelings into our brains.
3159940	3161740	And I do think it's worth noting
3161740	3164060	that the most famous and most terrifying
3164060	3165980	murder scene in cinema history
3165980	3170980	is of a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.
3171180	3173060	To quote a popular film critic,
3173060	3176260	you might not have noticed it, but your brain did.
3176260	3177940	The cross-dressing psychotrope
3177940	3179780	became explicitly transphobic
3179780	3183500	in the campy 1980s Psycho ripoff Dressed to Kill,
3183500	3186620	in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist
3186620	3189060	who, yes, dresses as a woman
3189060	3191980	to kill women he's attracted to.
3191980	3193420	He was a transsexual.
3193420	3194260	What?
3194260	3195300	A transsexual.
3195300	3196940	You see, there's some men and women, too,
3196940	3198420	think they're born in the wrong body.
3198420	3200060	They're called transsexuals.
3200060	3202660	And all they want to do is have their sex changed.
3202660	3204980	It's all they want to do, the transsexuals.
3204980	3208380	Dressed to Kill also ends with the psychiatric summing up,
3208380	3210500	where the doctor explains that Michael Caine
3210500	3212660	is a case of opposite sexes
3212660	3214180	inhabiting the same body.
3214180	3216980	But it's the female Michael Caine who kills,
3216980	3218620	because, and I quote,
3218620	3220460	Elliot's penis became erect,
3220460	3221820	and Bobby took control,
3221820	3225060	trying to kill anyone that made Elliot masculinely sexual.
3225060	3226580	There's often a misogynistic trope
3226580	3228460	hiding behind the transphobic one.
3228460	3231780	It's the woman in the man who does the murders.
3231780	3233180	It's the mother's fault.
3233180	3237300	His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.
3237300	3239540	The most mature iteration of this trope,
3239540	3241700	the crown jewel of transphobic movies,
3241700	3244260	is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,
3244260	3246060	which is honestly one of my favorite movies,
3246060	3248180	because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins
3248180	3250180	are just radiant in it.
3250180	3253060	And also, I hate myself.
3253060	3255740	Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,
3255740	3258980	an animal lover and innovative seamstress.
3258980	3261260	Buffalo Bill is a trans-trender.
3261260	3262460	A trans-trender!
3262460	3264900	Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin,
3264900	3268460	because his application for sex reassignment was rejected.
3268460	3271380	Because, according to Hannibal Lecter,
3271420	3273940	Billy is not a real transsexual.
3273940	3276980	Hannibal Lecter is a truscum!
3276980	3279060	There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,
3279060	3280980	I just want to use this opportunity
3280980	3282740	to reassure my trans audience
3282740	3285980	that even if you've only killed one or two people,
3285980	3286900	you're valid.
3288500	3289780	I entertain myself.
3289780	3292340	That's how I continue to struggle onwards.
3292340	3295260	Billy hates his own identity, you see,
3295260	3297660	and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.
3297660	3301820	But his pathology is a thousand times more savage
3301820	3303180	and more terrifying.
3303180	3307060	More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?
3307060	3308620	Is that even possible?
3308620	3310340	Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here,
3310340	3312460	because the sun is rising.
3312460	3314020	Silence of the Lambs differs
3314020	3316780	from its male gaze-y predecessors
3316780	3320140	in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.
3320140	3323380	Clarice is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,
3323380	3325860	and every man in this movie is a pig,
3325860	3327220	except maybe Hannibal Lecter,
3327780	3329340	the only one who actually respects Clarice,
3329340	3330580	the only real gentleman,
3330580	3333940	with his Goldberg variations in his sketches of the Duomo.
3333940	3337220	Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,
3337220	3339020	even Crawford's kind of a pig.
3339020	3341780	The pigs are pigs, Migs is pigs,
3341780	3344540	and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3344540	3347380	Die Uberschwein, it's in the original German.
3347380	3348700	The fuck am I talking about?
3348700	3349900	What?
3349900	3352140	And he's obsessed with death's head moths,
3352140	3356100	this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor
3356140	3357940	for gender transformation.
3357940	3359540	I can't believe I finally emerged
3359540	3361260	as a beautiful butterfly.
3361260	3362500	Show don't tell, Lily.
3362500	3363900	Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people
3363900	3366420	have so many rights that it's okay to make fun of us.
3366420	3367620	There's a lot to work with.
3367620	3369780	So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.
3369780	3371860	I'm not saying it's inherently wrong
3371860	3373540	to make a movie or write a book
3373540	3375340	about a transgender serial killer,
3375340	3377940	but there is an issue of representation.
3377940	3380420	You know, for decades, there was close to zero
3380420	3383660	good representation of trans people in movies or TV,
3383660	3387020	but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers,
3387020	3389780	and that has an effect on the way people think.
3389780	3392540	When it comes time to debate bathroom bills,
3392540	3395500	and people are subconsciously remembering Psycho,
3395500	3398420	that has serious consequences for trans people.
3398420	3399740	It's getting so bright in here,
3399740	3401660	the sun has like, the sun has risen.
3401660	3405260	And it's also not psychologically good for us
3405260	3407980	to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures
3407980	3409260	of ourselves in media.
3409260	3411340	Like even as late as my early 20s,
3411340	3413140	I didn't know any trans people,
3413180	3416180	but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.
3416180	3418500	I think the most positive approximation
3418500	3420100	of representation I knew about
3420100	3422860	was like Frank-N-Furter and Divine.
3422860	3425580	And both of them are also psychotic murderers,
3425580	3428300	just, you know, in a fun way.
3428300	3430340	Shoulda just gotten her those cha-cha heels.
3430340	3433380	So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,
3433380	3436020	but I guess I felt that it was basically
3436020	3439140	the moral equivalent of being a serial killer.
3439140	3441540	Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.
3441540	3443700	And things have changed in the last 10 years.
3443700	3446780	I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.
3446780	3449300	There's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me
3449300	3452700	who don't even hate themselves, can't relate.
3452700	3456020	So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.
3456020	3459100	Joanne has written a book about a serial killer
3459100	3461820	who dresses as a woman to kill women.
3461820	3462960	Groundbreaking.
3462960	3466220	Now this is such a cliche that you'd kind of expect
3466220	3469860	a seasoned writer like JK Rowling to subvert it somehow.
3469860	3472420	Give us a remix, turn it on its head.
3472420	3475100	Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.
3475100	3477580	You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.
3477580	3479860	Or at least do something new with it.
3479860	3480940	But she really doesn't.
3480940	3483460	It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.
3483460	3485380	I guess I should read you some passages.
3485380	3487740	I'm reading it on my phone, I'm not bringing the book out
3487740	3489700	and pretending to read on the book.
3489700	3491980	You can see from my little bookmarks
3491980	3493900	that I read the physical book.
3493900	3496980	Yes, I'm a YouTuber, and yes, I read a book.
3496980	3498580	So here's a psychiatrist.
3498580	3500420	There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?
3500420	3503220	Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.
3503220	3505500	He's a classic sociopath, you see.
3505500	3507460	A pure example of the type.
3507460	3510100	He scores very highly on the dark triad.
3510100	3513260	Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.
3513260	3517980	Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.
3517980	3521220	You see, he's what we in the medical profession call
3521220	3522260	the baddie.
3522260	3523420	Uh, quote Dennis.
3523420	3525220	It excited me to watch a woman
3525220	3527220	who didn't know she was being observed.
3527220	3528500	I'd do it to my sisters.
3528500	3530820	But I'd creep up to lit windows as well.
3530820	3533940	If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing,
3533940	3536220	adjusting themselves, or even a glimpse of nudity.
3536220	3539340	I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects,
3539340	3540580	but by the sense of power.
3540580	3543140	I felt I stole something of their essence from them,
3543140	3546140	taking that which they had thought private and hidden.
3546140	3548660	He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear
3548660	3550020	from neighbors' washing lines,
3550020	3552260	and even from his grandmother, Ina.
3552260	3554580	These he enjoyed wearing in secret,
3554580	3556220	and masturbating in.
3556980	3560100	Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?
3560100	3561300	Ho ho, dear readers.
3561300	3562940	So Dennis Creed is characterized
3562940	3566420	as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.
3566420	3568340	And like, okay, there really are men
3568340	3571380	who fetishize women's clothes, for example.
3571380	3573260	I mean, Freud talked about this, right?
3573260	3577260	Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part
3577260	3578940	or an article of clothing.
3578940	3582580	And Freud theorized that fetishes emerge
3582620	3586540	from the unconscious trauma that occurs
3586540	3591420	when men discover that women don't have a penis.
3593780	3596500	Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.
3596500	3598220	But considering that Joanne has been doing
3598220	3602220	a lot of gender-critical reading over the past few years,
3602220	3604820	it's kind of hard for me to ignore
3604820	3608700	that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women
3608700	3610820	is exactly the way a lot of TERFs
3610820	3612580	characterize trans women.
3612580	3616140	Remember, the whole gender-critical feminists
3616140	3620900	with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.
3620900	3622300	These people are bigots.
3622300	3625420	And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs
3625420	3630020	that trans women are hypersexual and hyperaggressive, right?
3630020	3633660	These inherently pornographic sex demons.
3633660	3637140	But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?
3637140	3639460	Are trans women sex demons?
3639460	3640580	Why, yes.
3640580	3641860	Yes, we are.
3641860	3643900	The bigots are simply correct.
3643900	3645900	We're sex demons.
3645900	3647420	You can't even talk to these people.
3647420	3651380	Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?
3651380	3653060	I used to take the bait and argue that,
3653060	3655780	no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.
3655780	3657180	Unless you want me to be.
3657180	3659560	But it's counterproductive to make that argument.
3659560	3660400	Why?
3660400	3663460	Because my not-involved-in-human-trafficking t-shirt
3663460	3665500	has people asking a lot of questions
3665500	3667260	already answered by my shirt.
3667260	3669060	So I have a hard time believing
3669060	3672300	that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do
3672300	3674740	with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.
3674740	3676180	And I also want to note
3676180	3678900	that Dennis's cross-dressing is described
3678900	3682020	not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains
3682020	3685660	from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,
3685660	3689140	but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.
3689140	3691980	Dennis says on page 854,
3691980	3694100	so you know I actually read this fucking shit.
3694100	3696100	In a wig, bit of lipstick.
3696100	3699420	They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.
3699420	3701060	You're the nice man who's safe.
3701060	3702740	And earlier, he's described as,
3702740	3705020	Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner,
3705020	3708940	a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.
3708940	3712020	Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper
3712020	3714180	and sometimes wearing a wig that,
3714180	3716540	from a distance, to a drunk victim,
3716540	3720220	gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough
3720220	3723780	for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.
3723780	3726980	So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination,
3726980	3730180	cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.
3730180	3733980	They mistake him for a woman, or as, you know.
3733980	3736060	And that causes them to lower their guard.
3736060	3739020	And this reminds me of one of my aforestatter's
3739020	3741660	allegedly transphobic tweets.
3741660	3745300	Pronouns are a hypnom, important article by Harry Lactapi.
3745300	3750300	A.K.A. Volfamort, she-who-must-not-be-named,
3750340	3753100	followed by J.K. Rowling, because of course.
3753100	3754620	Pronouns are rohypnol.
3754620	3755940	Rohypnol is roofies.
3755940	3758820	And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.
3758820	3760660	Pronouns are like rohypnol.
3760660	3762140	They dull your defenses.
3762140	3763980	They change your inhibitions.
3763980	3764820	They're meant to.
3764820	3767100	You've had a lifetime's experience learning
3767100	3770980	to be alert to him and to relax to her, for good reason.
3770980	3773780	These instinctive responses keep you safe.
3773780	3775740	It's not even a conscious thing.
3775740	3778020	It's like the hairs standing on end.
3778020	3780980	Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten
3781020	3782300	by the saber-toothed tiger
3782300	3784140	that your eyes haven't noticed yet.
3784140	3785380	I want to be alert.
3785380	3786980	I want others to be alert.
3786980	3789180	I want people to see the real picture,
3789180	3791460	and I want those instinctive reactions
3791460	3794380	that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted,
3794380	3798140	undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.
3798140	3800100	I feel like I owe this to myself,
3800100	3802860	and I absolutely owe it to other women.
3802860	3805940	And more than anything, I owe this to girls.
3805940	3808260	I don't want to play even the tiniest part
3808260	3810260	in grooming them to disregard
3810260	3812300	their natural protective instincts.
3812300	3815940	Those instincts are there for a reason, to keep them safe.
3815940	3819700	They need those instincts intact and sharp,
3819700	3823300	and that's why I won't use preferred pronouns.
3823300	3826540	Using rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.
3827540	3832340	Okay, so these are the thoughts
3832340	3833980	of someone who's been hurt.
3833980	3837580	Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason
3837580	3841020	that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people
3841020	3843100	is intensely personal.
3843100	3848100	♪♪♪
3859020	3861420	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,
3861420	3863860	meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,
3863860	3865660	meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
3865860	3869420	I was born this way.
3869420	3871140	Born as a fucking idiot.
3871140	3874420	I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old.
3874420	3875980	It's kind of an Agatha drink.
3875980	3878420	Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch.
3878420	3880900	That's the plot, pay attention, it makes sense.
3880900	3883140	Also, a martini, what is a martini?
3883140	3885300	But an excuse to drink a glass of gin.
3885300	3888220	Should probably eat an olive,
3888220	3892180	or this is gonna go straight to my fucking, my brain.
3892180	3893740	Okay, we have to be serious now.
3893740	3896060	In Turf Wars, Joanne writes,
3896060	3898700	I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years,
3898700	3900380	and I have never talked publicly
3900380	3903380	about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.
3903380	3906180	On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government
3906180	3907820	is proceeding with its controversial
3907820	3909180	gender recognition plans,
3909180	3912540	which will, in effect, mean that all a man needs to do
3912540	3915500	to become a woman is to say he's one.
3915500	3919300	To use a very contemporary word, I was triggered,
3919300	3922980	ground down by the relentless attacks from trans activists
3922980	3924060	on social media.
3924060	3926780	I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place
3926780	3930340	inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault
3930340	3932900	I suffered in my 20s recurred on a loop.
3932900	3934540	I couldn't shut out those memories,
3934540	3936780	and I was finding it hard to contain my anger
3936780	3938940	and disappointment about the way I believe
3938940	3941260	my government is playing fast and loose
3941260	3944060	with women's and girls' safety.
3944060	3947980	Okay, so for Joanne, her traumatic experience
3947980	3952020	being attacked by a man is psychologically related
3952060	3955940	to her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people,
3955940	3958860	and about trans people saying nasty things
3958860	3960180	about her on Twitter.
3960180	3962860	She feels intensely about this issue
3962860	3967300	because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD.
3967300	3968580	In her own words,
3968580	3970940	The scars left by violence and sexual assault
3970940	3973260	don't disappear, no matter how loved you are,
3973260	3975540	and no matter how much money you've made.
3975540	3977980	My perennial jumpiness is a family joke,
3977980	3979300	and even I know it's funny,
3979300	3982540	but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do
3982540	3986340	for hating sudden loud noises or finding people behind me
3986340	3988140	when I haven't heard them approaching.
3988140	3991740	A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance,
3991740	3994260	a constant alertness to danger.
3994260	3997060	This is described in a very wise book
3997060	4000380	called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Schulman.
4000380	4002980	The traumatized person's sense of their ability
4002980	4006500	to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed.
4006500	4007860	They feel endangered,
4007860	4010860	even if there is no actual danger in the present,
4010860	4012200	because in the past,
4012200	4015300	they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty,
4015300	4016860	and they know it is possible.
4016860	4020020	I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response
4020020	4022340	is a real experience of suffering
4022340	4024300	that is not the victim's fault,
4024300	4027820	even in cases where that response is irrational
4027820	4029580	or politically incorrect.
4029580	4034060	For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager,
4034060	4037140	I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy
4037140	4039260	around black teenagers for a while.
4039260	4042060	However, if that jumpiness motivates you
4042060	4043460	to become a campaigner
4043460	4046660	for more militant policing of black neighborhoods,
4046660	4050180	then you are participating in anti-black racism,
4050180	4053460	and that I will criticize, regardless of your trauma.
4053460	4055020	I hope it goes without saying
4055020	4057340	that trans people gaining easier access
4057340	4060640	to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020
4060640	4063780	is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling
4064460	4067900	being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s.
4067900	4069340	This is a non sequitur.
4069340	4071740	So it's a little odd to me that,
4071740	4074460	while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize
4074460	4077460	that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma,
4077460	4079460	and she's self-aware enough to realize
4079460	4082060	that her hypervigilance is often irrational
4082060	4084900	to the point where she herself finds humor in it,
4084900	4088540	she's somehow not self-aware enough to realize
4088540	4091020	that her fears about trans people
4091020	4094960	are an irrational manifestation of that hypervigilance.
4094960	4098060	And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma,
4098060	4099820	and I would be nothing but sympathetic
4099820	4101660	if her feelings about this amounted
4101660	4104540	to simply being triggered by, for example,
4104540	4107340	perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom,
4107340	4110580	which is something most trans women are sensitive to.
4110580	4112020	Like, I've spoken to trans women
4112020	4113480	who are worried they don't pass,
4113480	4115180	or who know they don't pass,
4115180	4116860	and who do everything they can
4116860	4118980	to avoid using a public bathroom
4118980	4121380	because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.
4121380	4123980	So these trans women go through life every day
4123980	4126860	compromising their own comfort and safety
4126860	4130860	to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.
4130860	4134740	But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope
4134740	4136800	of an automatic trigger response.
4136800	4140020	It's become a fixation for years,
4140020	4143460	to the point where she's written a 900-page novel
4143460	4145700	about a serial killer who cross-dresses
4145700	4148300	to trick women into being less vigilant.
4148300	4150940	And now, the primary political cause
4150940	4154380	she's decided to use her superstardom to champion
4154380	4156780	is opposition to trans liberation.
4156780	4160600	And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.
4160600	4162580	Like, if you're against gay marriage
4162580	4165060	because you were traumatized as a child
4165060	4167780	when your father left your mother for a man,
4167780	4169540	you're still a homophobe, right?
4169540	4171020	You're not less of a bigot
4171020	4173340	because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.
4173340	4176420	In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.
4176420	4179820	Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked,
4179820	4181860	so it's often rooted in trauma.
4181860	4183900	After the collective trauma of 9-11,
4183900	4187260	Americans felt threatened, not just by al-Qaeda,
4187260	4189540	but by the entire religion of Islam.
4189540	4192340	And this was used, and is still being used,
4192340	4196700	to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.
4196700	4199540	Feelings of victimization are often used
4199540	4201860	as a justification for aggression.
4201860	4203160	And when the target of that aggression
4203160	4206400	is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.
4206400	4210400	Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists
4210400	4213680	who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.
4213680	4216920	Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy,
4216920	4220280	creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.
4220280	4224680	TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.
4224680	4228240	It's biological women who are the real victims.
4228240	4230040	The real victim.
4230040	4232240	So often in debates on social issues,
4232240	4234480	we're faced with two opposing sides,
4234480	4237360	both claiming to be the victim,
4237360	4239920	and we're often told to believe victims,
4239920	4242000	believe marginalized people.
4242000	4243560	Well if only it was that easy.
4243560	4246480	So often, the exact point in question
4246480	4250280	is who is the victim, and who's the oppressor?
4250280	4252840	That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse,
4252840	4255500	describes the way the overstatement of harm
4255500	4258080	is used as a justification for cruelty
4258080	4260880	in situations ranging from romantic relationships
4260880	4262520	to international affairs.
4262520	4264880	Bullies often conceptualize themselves
4264880	4266480	as being under attack
4266480	4268760	when they are the ones originating the pain.
4268760	4270040	Throughout Joanne's essay,
4270040	4272280	she frequently represents herself
4272280	4276240	as taking a defiant, free-speechy stand against.
4276240	4279480	Accusations and threats from trans activists.
4279480	4281880	The trans activists who declare that TERFs
4281880	4283720	need punching and reeducating.
4283720	4287000	Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified
4287000	4288760	by the trans activists.
4288760	4290680	And in her subsequent tweets,
4291440	4294960	she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.
4294960	4297120	Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.
4297120	4298800	This witch doesn't burn.
4298800	4300240	This is the new Salem?
4300240	4302640	Women are being attacked online
4302640	4305240	for taking a stand against the transsexuals?
4305240	4306760	This witch doesn't burn.
4306760	4308240	Let's see what else we have for sale
4308240	4311720	at wildwomenworkshop.com.
4311720	4313280	Fuck your pronouns.
4313280	4315920	Trans men are my sisters.
4315920	4317760	Sorry about your dick, bro.
4317760	4319480	That's a good one, I'd wear that.
4319480	4320920	Don't call me sis.
4320920	4324480	Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.
4324480	4325640	Must be really hard for you.
4325640	4326840	Not being a tr-
4326840	4328400	War is peace.
4328400	4330240	Freedom is slavery.
4330240	4332320	Ignorance is strength.
4332320	4334600	Trans women are women.
4334600	4336600	Got the sense of persecution.
4336600	4338160	This is Orwell's nightmare?
4338160	4340240	This is how Nazi Germany started?
4340240	4342280	First Hitler told the transgenders
4342280	4344680	they're a super-hecking valid uwu,
4344680	4346160	then he burned their books out.
4346160	4348480	Wait, oh, no.
4348480	4351240	That's actually the opposite of what happened.
4351240	4354240	Slurs, feminist t-shirt.
4354240	4356200	Nice trilby, it's very dapper.
4356200	4361200	Slurs, man-hater, feminazi, prude, witch, bigot.
4361800	4363080	Wait, bigot?
4363080	4365200	Are we reclaiming bigot now?
4365200	4370200	Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?
4370880	4372200	Joanne wrote in her essay
4372200	4374600	that she was standing up in solidarity
4374600	4376880	with women who have histories like mine
4376880	4378440	who've been slurred as bigots
4378440	4381440	for having concerns around single-sex spaces.
4381440	4383280	Slurred as bigots.
4383280	4386200	There's something so revealing about the claim
4386200	4388160	that bigot is a slur,
4388160	4390360	because so much of indirect bigotry
4390360	4394360	is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.
4394360	4398840	Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?
4398840	4400480	It's good, it's very clever.
4400480	4402600	A white racist will hardly ever use
4402600	4404480	the phrase white supremacy.
4404520	4409520	No, they say white genocide, always on the defensive.
4409520	4414240	And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.
4414240	4416440	The same conservative media,
4416440	4418800	who 10 years ago were portraying lesbians
4418800	4421880	as like angry mannish dicks,
4421880	4424880	have now created this mythology of lesbians
4424880	4428560	as these virginal damsels in distress
4428560	4430680	who are threatened with invasion,
4430680	4432880	and now extinction.
4432880	4436800	On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists
4436800	4439520	who are somehow coercing them into becoming men,
4439520	4442200	Elliot, no, you can't possibly be doing this
4442200	4443440	because you're 33 years old
4443440	4445200	and capable of autonomous thought.
4445200	4446720	Clearly, you are tricked
4446720	4449720	by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.
4449720	4453480	And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told,
4453480	4455920	are slurring as bigots.
4455920	4458000	Lesbians who won't sleep with them.
4458000	4459160	Joanne claims that,
4459160	4461400	none of the gender critical women I've talked to
4461400	4462720	hates trans people.
4462720	4465520	On the contrary, many of them become interested
4465520	4467080	in this issue in the first place
4467080	4469000	out of concern for trans youth,
4469000	4472400	and they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults
4472400	4474440	who simply want to live their lives.
4474440	4478080	But the only gender critical women she mentions by name
4478080	4481800	are Maya Forstater, who I would not describe
4481800	4484960	as hugely sympathetic to trans adults,
4484960	4488880	and Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says,
4488960	4492360	Magdalene was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian.
4492360	4494000	Magdalene was a great believer
4494000	4496360	in the importance of biological sex
4496360	4499040	and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots
4499040	4501920	for not dating trans women with penises.
4501920	4506640	Okay, so I agree it would be awful to call someone a bigot
4506640	4509960	just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis,
4509960	4512240	but are you sure that's why people
4512240	4514360	call Magdalene Burns a bigot?
4514360	4516560	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else
4516560	4519080	about trans women that might lead people
4519080	4522840	to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?
4522840	4526200	You are fucking blackface actors.
4526200	4530320	You aren't women, you're men who get sexual kicks
4530320	4532160	from being treated like women.
4532160	4535880	Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.
4535880	4540520	Our oppression isn't a fetish, you pathetic, sick fuck.
4540520	4544280	Hugely sympathetic, hugely sympathetic.
4544280	4548160	Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic
4548160	4552040	to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots,
4552040	4554360	and because she constantly frames herself
4554360	4557880	as the victim of terrifying trans activists
4557880	4560120	who say mean things online,
4560120	4565080	I think it's fair for me to mention that this right here
4565080	4567660	is how I'm used to being spoken to
4567660	4570440	and spoken about by TERFs.
4570440	4572360	When you're a trans woman online,
4572360	4575120	TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.
4575120	4578360	They deadname and misgender you, they mock your genitals,
4578360	4580560	they describe your surgery results
4580560	4582840	as necrotic mutilated wounds,
4582840	4585740	they interpret your every feeling and experience
4585740	4589160	as the manifestation of a sick woman-hating fetish.
4589160	4591880	You know, in an unrelated video last year,
4591880	4595880	I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man,
4595880	4599200	and I've since been told by TERFs,
4599200	4603200	essentially, trans-identified males get sexual kicks
4603200	4605040	from being treated like women.
4605040	4608800	Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.
4608800	4611200	Hugely sympathetic.
4611200	4615320	I hope I don't even need to say that the idea
4615320	4620040	that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it
4620040	4623480	is a violently anti-feminist thought,
4623480	4626120	and it's a thought that could only be believed,
4626120	4628800	and believed in the name of feminism, no less,
4629360	4631840	by people who have spent days and weeks
4631840	4634820	absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda
4634820	4637400	that TERF forums exist to promote.
4637400	4639400	Now I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room
4639400	4641480	with me right now, she'd say,
4641480	4643800	"'I'm so sorry you've been treated that way,
4643800	4647140	"'but I too have been cruelly victimized online
4647140	4649080	"'by the trans activists.'"
4649080	4651040	And you know what?
4651040	4652520	I'm sure that's true.
4652520	4654240	When I listen to Joanne talk
4654240	4657320	about being victimized by trans Twitter,
4657320	4659120	it's easy for me to sympathize,
4659120	4661760	because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.
4661760	4664040	The vilification, the obsession,
4664040	4665880	the fantasies of violence.
4665880	4667400	It's a pretty common occurrence
4667400	4669040	for me to look up my mentions
4669040	4671640	and see people with trans flag avatars
4671640	4673120	posting things like,
4673120	4674960	"'Point of view, you are truescum
4674960	4677680	"'and Yoshi is gonna beat you to death with a golf club.'"
4677680	4679680	Hashtag yes all gamers.
4679680	4683000	Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-semite
4683000	4684540	because three years ago I made a joke
4684540	4686200	about reptilian overlords,
4686200	4688360	and then they get mad because I said
4688360	4690400	I wanted to understand non-binary people
4690400	4692760	instead of just dogmatically believing things,
4692760	4693960	and they conclude,
4693960	4696560	"'So basically, fuck ContraPoints,
4696560	4698280	"'I wanna bash her over the goddamn head
4698280	4701040	"'with a metal bat over and over again.'"
4701040	4704240	So this is the level of antipathy
4704240	4706480	that I attract from trans Twitter.
4706480	4708720	So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed
4708720	4710520	by abusive messages,
4710520	4712280	I'm inclined to believe her.
4712280	4714320	I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed
4714320	4716880	with anime avatars saying things like,
4716880	4718560	"'J.K. Rowling is hypocritical trash
4718560	4721000	"'who literally waltz millions of trans kids dead.'"
4721000	4722960	"'Harry Potter was always neoliberal,
4722960	4725220	"'garbage, and we should have seen this coming.'"
4725220	4727460	"'This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy,
4727460	4730240	"'she deserves a backhand slap to the face.'"
4730240	4733020	And tweets like that are abusive.
4733020	4736380	It's not okay, and I don't make any excuses for it.
4736380	4737920	I wanna make a dark and stormy.
4737920	4739280	Sorry, I'll be right back.
4740160	4741240	Hey, I'm back.
4743240	4744080	It's good.
4744840	4746120	So I also think that there really is
4746120	4748480	an element of misogyny to them.
4748480	4750780	I had to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.
4750780	4755780	You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying
4756280	4757800	while holding a tropical drink.
4757800	4760040	It's just not possible to do with a straight face.
4760040	4763200	So I agree, there really is an element of misogyny to this.
4763200	4765720	Misogyny is the most universal prejudice,
4765720	4767840	and trans people are not immune.
4767840	4770840	Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women,
4770840	4773320	regardless of whether their anger is justified.
4773320	4775160	There is a witch hunt impulse
4775160	4777160	that's still alive in our culture.
4777160	4780280	To be a famous woman is to constantly have
4780280	4782320	every part of your body and soul
4782320	4784680	subject to endless critique.
4784680	4786280	You know, if you're one pound overweight,
4786280	4787480	they call you a fatty.
4787480	4788960	If you're one pound underweight,
4788960	4790880	they say you have an eating disorder.
4790880	4792880	And if you're exactly the right weight,
4794020	4796720	they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.
4796720	4799640	You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.
4799640	4803040	There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.
4803040	4804420	When you're a famous woman,
4804420	4806520	it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters,
4806520	4809720	because the haters bring the obsession to you.
4809720	4811920	But it's important to remember
4811920	4815080	that haters are not the same as bigots.
4815080	4819760	Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry,
4819760	4822760	unless it's tied to a history of oppression
4822760	4825680	or a backlash against a movement of equality.
4825680	4829440	So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.
4829440	4832040	And no, David Silverman, the word racist
4832040	4833800	is not like the N-word.
4833800	4837240	And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.
4837240	4838920	Turf is not a slur.
4838920	4842360	And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse,
4842360	4844680	but it's not a form of oppression.
4844680	4847600	And I say this as someone, at this point,
4847600	4850560	most known for complaining about cancel culture.
4850560	4852220	Oh god, is this my legacy?
4852220	4854560	A lot of trans people have been very mean,
4854560	4857280	verbally abusive even, to JK Rowling.
4857280	4859480	But most people criticizing Joanne,
4859480	4861960	or criticizing me for that matter,
4862840	4865320	might be hurt and angry, but they're not violent.
4865320	4868200	But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands
4868200	4872000	of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,
4872000	4876360	you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing
4876360	4878560	crashing over you all at once.
4878560	4882860	And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent,
4882860	4885640	they become emblematic of the way
4885640	4888560	the whole experience feels.
4888560	4891600	And if you've been the victim of abuse before,
4892120	4894160	the experience can be pretty triggering.
4894160	4897760	So it's just not always as simple as the victim,
4897760	4899360	and the abuser.
4899360	4902080	Sometimes victims are also abusers.
4902080	4905520	Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.
4905520	4908480	Sometimes righteously angry people
4908480	4911280	cross a line into abusive excess.
4911280	4914640	And not all abuse comes from a position of power.
4914640	4916720	Why are so many trans people on Twitter
4916720	4920800	so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?
4920800	4923880	Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse
4923880	4926720	that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter
4926720	4928520	as it does to TERFs.
4928520	4930600	People living in unrecovered trauma
4930600	4932600	often behave in very similar ways
4932600	4934280	to the people who traumatize them.
4934280	4936640	Over and over, I have seen traumatized people
4936640	4939400	refuse to hear or engage information
4939400	4941280	that would alter their self-concepts,
4941280	4942680	even in ways that could bring them
4942680	4944540	more happiness and integrity.
4944540	4947160	The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal
4947160	4949740	is rooted in a panic that their fragile self
4949740	4951460	cannot bear interrogation,
4951460	4954380	that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.
4954380	4956220	Perhaps because supremacy in some
4956220	4959900	produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.
4959900	4961860	And of course, many perpetrators
4961860	4964260	were or are victims themselves.
4964260	4967860	A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,
4967860	4971500	and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse
4971500	4973820	at trans people, a vulnerable group
4973820	4976300	who they can mostly get away with hurting.
4976300	4978500	Unlike standing up to powerful men, right,
4978500	4981100	which would be dangerous and difficult.
4981100	4983100	And a lot of trans people have been
4983100	4986260	very horribly treated by men, by TERFs,
4986260	4989480	by strangers on the street, by their own families.
4989480	4991500	And for some of those trans people,
4991500	4993740	canceling celebrities on Twitter
4993740	4996340	is the one kind of power they have.
4996340	4999820	Plus, a lot of extremely online trans people
4999820	5002780	really don't have a strong sense of conviction
5002780	5004940	in their own identity, which is why they need
5004940	5008260	constant external validation to prop them up.
5009020	5011500	They need to constantly be told that they're valid,
5011500	5014020	that they really are the gender that they say they are.
5014020	5017820	And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions
5017820	5021520	their fragile self-concept, they lash out,
5021520	5023540	Twitter being their only weapon.
5023540	5026260	You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay
5026260	5029180	that all you're asking, all you want,
5029180	5031020	is empathy and understanding.
5031020	5033820	And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.
5033820	5036540	But trans people also deserve more empathy
5036540	5038500	and understanding than you've given them.
5038500	5041340	Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts
5041340	5043460	that are always raging against you
5043460	5046140	and raging against me, for that matter.
5046140	5049620	In between the raging, look at what they're doing.
5049620	5053140	They're begging, begging for money to pay for healthcare,
5053140	5055300	begging for money to pay for housing.
5055300	5059540	You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,
5059540	5064540	or pounds, or gringotts, or whatever you people have.
5064660	5066140	And trans people are out here
5066140	5068860	literally begging for healthcare.
5068860	5070580	They're begging, Joanne.
5070580	5073980	How powerful could the trans agenda really be?
5073980	5077300	Joanne, you have so much power and influence,
5077300	5080380	many, many times more than what I have.
5080380	5082900	And I have much more power and influence
5082900	5084700	than most trans people.
5084700	5086900	You know, I am in a very different situation
5086900	5088140	than most trans people.
5088140	5091040	I have a lot of other things going for me in this world,
5091040	5093660	but a lot of them have nothing.
5093660	5096140	They have nothing, Joanne.
5096140	5100260	And I just, I think you should take that into consideration
5100260	5102620	next time you decide to speak out
5102620	5105280	about how trans activists are oppressing you.
5106780	5107980	Get it together, Gorge.
5107980	5109220	Are you listening to yourself?
5109220	5110420	What are you doing, Joanne?
5110420	5112900	You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life
5112900	5115940	being rejected and humiliated and excluded
5115940	5117580	over and over again.
5117580	5120300	So they're traumatized, they're easily triggered
5120300	5123100	by anything that reminds them of past betrayal
5123100	5125260	and abandonment, which is something
5125260	5127420	I think you could empathize with.
5127420	5130020	Joanne, you are famous for writing a book
5130020	5133580	about a neglected and abused boy who lives in a closet
5133580	5136180	until he's whisked away to a magical world
5136180	5137860	where he and his freaky friends
5137860	5139620	find acceptance in each other.
5139620	5141860	I remember when I first met you all.
5141860	5145260	Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
5145260	5146700	We're still a bunch of misfits.
5146700	5149420	Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
5149420	5153280	So many trans people have found comfort in this story
5153280	5156580	and an escape from a world that doesn't offer
5156580	5158660	a lot of comfort to trans people.
5158660	5161660	So for you to use your fame and influence
5161660	5165980	to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,
5165980	5168820	it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.
5168820	5170980	And I don't blame them for feeling that way.
5170980	5172460	I feel it too.
5172460	5173460	So, Joanne.
5174560	5175820	Jo.
5175820	5177060	Mother.
5177060	5178580	I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.
5178580	5180500	I know how much that sucks,
5180500	5183580	so if you ever wanna take me up on it,
5183580	5185660	I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.
5185660	5187860	But otherwise, I think we're done here.
5187860	5190180	As a trans person, I like to believe
5190180	5192180	in the power of human metamorphosis.
5192180	5193780	But I realize that at this point,
5193780	5196740	you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes
5196740	5198940	and constantly trashed by trans people,
5198940	5200940	so it would be pretty difficult
5200940	5202620	to change tracks at this point.
5202620	5204660	You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off,
5204660	5208300	and I don't know, Joanne, maybe you are one in a million.
5209020	5209860	I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban,
5209860	5211580	and that shit got me through fifth grade,
5211580	5214580	so who knows, maybe you have another miracle in you.
5214580	5216780	But I'm too old to believe in magic now,
5216780	5220540	so I'm not gonna sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.
5222100	5222940	Okay.
5223860	5224980	I guess that's it.
5227460	5228940	Mischief managed.
