WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.720
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.620
Something wicked this way comes.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.000
Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.200
Magical darkness.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.340
A must.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.760
Joanne, I wanna talk to you, Joanne.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.400
What is it about Joannes?

00:29.400 --> 00:31.480
I can't catch a break from these people.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.000
So, now that 2020 is finally over,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.040
I think we can let the record conclusively show

00:38.040 --> 00:40.300
that it was a year whomst is bad.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.480
And on top of everything else that was going on,

00:42.480 --> 00:44.080
truly the last thing we needed

00:44.080 --> 00:47.040
was the author of Harry Potter coming forward to announce

00:47.040 --> 00:49.400
there's two things she can't stand,

00:49.400 --> 00:52.680
bigotry and the transgenders.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.800
Ow.

00:53.800 --> 00:58.000
Elderberry wand, turgid, with a core of,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.880
ice dragon, lumos.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.120
Can we afford spells?

01:03.120 --> 01:04.040
Is that in the budget?

01:04.040 --> 01:06.080
Expecto Patreon.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.360
So, you've probably heard by now

01:07.360 --> 01:10.120
about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.820
Unless you've been living under a rock,

01:11.820 --> 01:14.640
in which case, get back under that rock, sweetie.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.640
There is nothing good going on up here.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.560
It's not worth it.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.320
Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did

01:19.320 --> 01:21.680
was say biological sex is real,

01:21.680 --> 01:25.400
and now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists

01:25.400 --> 01:27.040
are trying to silence her.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.080
This is cancel culture gone too far.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.800
This is a witch hunt.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.720
Celebrities are under attack.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.280
This is the new Salem.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.040
This is Orwell's nightmare.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.160
This is a painful topic for me all around

01:38.160 --> 01:40.720
because as a transgender woman,

01:40.720 --> 01:43.840
I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things

01:43.840 --> 01:45.640
Joanne has said in the last year.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.640
But I also know what it's like

01:47.640 --> 01:49.400
to be the target of a Twitter mob.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.540
And I realize that to most people,

01:51.540 --> 01:54.680
complaining about being canceled,

01:54.680 --> 01:57.720
it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.200
Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people

02:00.200 --> 02:02.920
like J.K. Rowling would be above

02:02.920 --> 02:04.440
staying up alone at night

02:04.440 --> 02:07.440
reading mean things people say online.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.000
But you'd think wrong.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.480
See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness

02:11.480 --> 02:12.680
of the human condition,

02:12.680 --> 02:15.760
and no amount of fame and money is gonna fix that.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.760
You know, fame alienates you from other people.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.920
It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,

02:21.920 --> 02:24.680
which can actually make you feel more alone,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.560
even when people are worshiping you as a goddess.

02:28.360 --> 02:30.520
Nevermind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.080
The truth is that unless you've personally experienced

02:34.080 --> 02:36.400
infamy, being shamed and shunned

02:36.400 --> 02:39.560
on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.400
then you just don't know what it's like.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.320
And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.680
But Joanne knows,

02:45.680 --> 02:48.700
and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.260
there's a traumatized part of me

02:50.260 --> 02:53.800
that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.920
And I wanna protect

02:55.840 --> 02:57.680
my nurturing and compassionate nature

02:57.680 --> 02:59.960
sometimes gets the best of me.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.360
But there's also a part of me that wants

03:01.360 --> 03:02.600
to join the trashing.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.720
How could you do this to me, Joanne?

03:04.720 --> 03:06.160
I did not come out of the cupboard

03:06.160 --> 03:07.480
under the stairs for this.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.960
So what I wanna do in this video

03:08.960 --> 03:11.240
is take Joanne's pain seriously

03:11.240 --> 03:13.680
and treat her like a complex human being,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.960
while also being critical of the things she said

03:16.960 --> 03:19.600
about the transgender question.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.080
And I also wanna explore where the Twitter mob

03:22.080 --> 03:23.160
is coming from,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.280
because they're in pain too,

03:25.280 --> 03:28.120
and don't they also deserve our understanding?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.560
So without further ado,

03:29.560 --> 03:34.240
let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush

03:34.240 --> 03:37.440
and see if we can find the truth.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.700
Swish and flick.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.200
♪♪♪

03:41.200 --> 03:54.160
So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.840
Well, she certainly seems invested

03:55.840 --> 03:58.120
in the belief that she's not a bigot.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.560
What vice do you most despise?

04:00.560 --> 04:01.400
Bigotry.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.240
And looking over Joanne's tweets,

04:03.240 --> 04:04.800
I don't think the average person

04:04.800 --> 04:07.360
would see any problem with what she's said.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.160
However, I mean, not to be condescending,

04:10.160 --> 04:13.040
but I feel like the average person's understanding

04:13.040 --> 04:16.760
of transgender is still a little bit,

04:16.760 --> 04:19.600
I don't really get the whole trans thing.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.960
Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?

04:24.480 --> 04:27.560
I don't know, Amber, why don't you be a feminine man?

04:27.560 --> 04:29.440
Who knows, you could be missing out.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.960
So we're gonna go through the things

04:30.960 --> 04:32.760
that Joanne has said about trans people,

04:32.760 --> 04:35.880
but I don't want this to be just a drama video

04:35.880 --> 04:39.640
or a video saying cancel Harry Potter, drag her.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.960
I wanna try to do something

04:40.960 --> 04:43.360
a little bit more meaningful than that.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.840
So I'm gonna use JK Rowe as a case study in bigotry

04:47.840 --> 04:50.320
and see if we can maybe learn something

04:50.320 --> 04:52.600
about what bigotry is.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.820
How does it work?

04:53.820 --> 04:57.040
And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?

04:57.040 --> 04:59.640
And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,

04:59.640 --> 05:01.440
well, for once I think I'll actually

05:01.440 --> 05:03.760
have earned my Patreon budget.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.420
So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,

05:07.420 --> 05:10.280
let's spill some shade, throw some tea.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.100
So this all started in 2018

05:13.100 --> 05:15.660
when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet

05:15.660 --> 05:17.980
and followed an anti-trans account.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.300
Now in the interest of giving Joanne

05:19.300 --> 05:21.380
as much benefit of the doubt as I can,

05:21.380 --> 05:23.100
I'm not gonna admit this as evidence

05:23.100 --> 05:25.740
because I don't wanna do guilt by association.

05:25.740 --> 05:27.800
Strike it from the record.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.700
That was fun, I like hammering things.

05:29.700 --> 05:34.220
The real story begins in December 2019

05:34.220 --> 05:37.340
when Joanne tweeted the hashtag I stand with Maya

05:38.060 --> 05:39.060
referencing Maya Forstater.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.220
Maya Forstater is an English consultant

05:41.220 --> 05:44.020
who lost her contract with the nonprofit she worked for

05:44.020 --> 05:46.620
after she did transphobic tweets.

05:46.620 --> 05:49.460
And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us

05:49.460 --> 05:53.140
in her thread titled Allegedly Transphobic Tweets.

05:53.140 --> 05:57.140
Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.480
Yes, I think that male people are not women.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.460
I don't think that being a woman or female

06:01.460 --> 06:04.140
is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.

06:04.140 --> 06:05.300
It is biology.

06:05.340 --> 06:06.340
Another says.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.860
Some people believe that a person

06:07.860 --> 06:09.500
with a penis can be a woman.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.860
Some, a majority, don't.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.740
Neither group should be discriminated against

06:13.740 --> 06:15.820
in everyday life, but in situations

06:15.820 --> 06:18.160
involving taking your clothes off for strangers,

06:18.160 --> 06:20.620
integration of the two groups is not possible.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.580
And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,

06:23.580 --> 06:27.000
burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women

06:27.000 --> 06:30.740
and saying, it's all right, it's a woman's penis.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.860
So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.780
Everyone born female is a woman,

06:35.780 --> 06:37.500
everyone born male is a man,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.700
trans women are predators who prey on women,

06:39.700 --> 06:42.900
and I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.380
Is this what you want, Joanne?

06:44.380 --> 06:46.160
You wanna put the sorting hat on humanity

06:46.160 --> 06:48.020
and divide us up into little houses?

06:48.020 --> 06:49.140
Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor

06:49.140 --> 06:51.060
trapped in a Hufflepuff's body?

06:51.060 --> 06:52.420
What then, Joanne?

06:52.420 --> 06:53.360
What then?

06:53.360 --> 06:56.140
Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?

06:56.140 --> 06:57.780
Well, if the tweet simply said,

06:57.780 --> 07:00.940
I stand with Maya without further explanation,

07:00.940 --> 07:02.860
you could give her the benefit of the doubt.

07:02.860 --> 07:05.180
Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job

07:05.180 --> 07:07.020
for having bigoted opinions,

07:07.020 --> 07:08.980
even if she disagrees with those opinions.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.020
But if that's all she was saying,

07:11.020 --> 07:13.340
I wouldn't be making this video, would I?

07:13.340 --> 07:14.740
The full tweet reads,

07:14.740 --> 07:18.200
Dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.140
Sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

07:21.140 --> 07:24.300
Live your best life in peace and security.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.540
But force women out of their jobs

07:26.540 --> 07:28.500
for stating that sex is real?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.660
Hashtag I stand with Maya, hashtag this is not a drill.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.860
Now I'm guessing that to most people,

07:33.860 --> 07:37.220
this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.480
It might even seem supportive of trans people,

07:39.480 --> 07:42.700
since she said we're allowed to dress however we want

07:42.700 --> 07:46.100
and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.300
But there's a couple things about this

07:47.300 --> 07:48.700
that don't sit right with me.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.140
First is the phrase,

07:50.140 --> 07:54.740
force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.040
Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary

07:58.040 --> 08:00.820
of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint,

08:00.820 --> 08:01.660
namely,

08:01.660 --> 08:04.060
I believe that it is impossible to change your sex

08:04.060 --> 08:05.380
or to lose your sex.

08:05.380 --> 08:08.180
Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men.

08:08.180 --> 08:11.220
No change of clothes or hairstyle, no plastic surgery,

08:11.220 --> 08:13.860
no accident or illness, no course of hormones,

08:13.860 --> 08:17.020
no force of will or social conditioning, no declaration

08:17.020 --> 08:18.980
can turn a female person into a male

08:18.980 --> 08:20.860
or a male person into a female.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.980
If Joanne had said Maya had been fired

08:22.980 --> 08:26.460
for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman

08:26.460 --> 08:29.500
and a person born female could never be a man,

08:29.660 --> 08:31.260
that would've been more accurate,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.340
but it would also sound contentious,

08:33.340 --> 08:35.220
and obviously anti-trans.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.540
Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present

08:38.540 --> 08:42.180
Maya Forstater's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,

08:42.180 --> 08:43.740
basic common sense,

08:43.740 --> 08:47.460
which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.980
Transphobes love to play this game

08:48.980 --> 08:51.220
where they pretend that trans people

08:51.220 --> 08:54.500
just don't understand basic biology, that's our problem.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.580
As if I didn't start taking female hormones

08:56.580 --> 08:58.380
because I'm acutely aware

08:58.380 --> 09:01.140
that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body,

09:01.140 --> 09:02.740
that sex is real.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.940
You will never be a woman, Nathan.

09:04.940 --> 09:09.300
Every cell in your body is male and has a Y chromosome.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.380
Really?

09:10.380 --> 09:11.220
That's crazy.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.140
How'd you learn so much about science?

09:13.140 --> 09:14.380
You know, I don't really feel the need

09:14.380 --> 09:15.940
to have a second X chromosome.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.220
I get by with one.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.340
I make it work.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.900
I actually like the Y chromosome.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.020
I think it's a little more dainty, you know?

09:22.020 --> 09:25.100
It's a little softer, a little more petite.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.900
The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages,

09:27.980 --> 09:28.820
don't you think?

09:28.820 --> 09:31.060
And I don't need any more of those, thanks.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.900
No trans person thinks it's possible

09:32.900 --> 09:34.660
to change chromosomal sex,

09:34.660 --> 09:37.540
and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.500
When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.260
we're talking about psychological and social identity.

09:43.260 --> 09:46.020
So when transphobes say sex is real,

09:46.020 --> 09:47.540
they're not actually contradicting

09:47.540 --> 09:51.580
anything most trans people believe, except by implication.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.820
When transphobes say sex is real,

09:53.820 --> 09:57.220
what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.380
They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,

10:00.380 --> 10:03.380
which they trivialize, calling it dressing up,

10:03.380 --> 10:07.060
fashion choices, whatever you wanna call yourself.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.380
When Joanne says, dress however you please,

10:10.380 --> 10:12.620
call yourself whatever you like,

10:12.620 --> 10:15.580
she's belittling what it actually means to be trans,

10:15.580 --> 10:18.020
reducing it to a change of name and costume.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.620
It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.780
For example, the homophobic equivalent

10:22.780 --> 10:24.380
of Joanne's tweet might read,

10:24.420 --> 10:26.940
Choose whatever lifestyle you want.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.500
Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult

10:30.500 --> 10:32.620
in the privacy of your own bedroom.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.940
But force Christians out of their jobs

10:34.940 --> 10:38.140
for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?

10:38.140 --> 10:40.780
Hashtag I stand with Kim Davis.

10:40.780 --> 10:44.380
A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.

10:44.380 --> 10:47.980
Checkmate the gays, it's just science.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.740
Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.

10:50.740 --> 10:53.540
They refer to it as sexual preferences,

10:53.540 --> 10:57.700
or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.620
We don't tell straight people

10:58.620 --> 11:02.260
to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.660
Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.260
Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.740
It's also who you love.

11:10.740 --> 11:13.500
It's part of who you are, part of your humanity,

11:13.500 --> 11:15.540
and that's something that stays with you

11:15.540 --> 11:16.920
outside of the bedroom.

11:16.920 --> 11:21.460
So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.

11:21.460 --> 11:24.380
Likewise, being trans is not a costume

11:24.380 --> 11:25.940
I take off at the end of the night.

11:25.940 --> 11:28.020
It's not a fashion choice.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.260
It's not a pet name some people call me.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.120
It's part of who I am as a person, you know?

11:34.120 --> 11:35.900
It's part of my humanity,

11:35.900 --> 11:39.580
and it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.

11:39.580 --> 11:42.620
So telling trans people to dress however you want

11:42.620 --> 11:45.420
is not really a supportive statement,

11:45.420 --> 11:49.060
unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks

11:49.060 --> 11:51.540
in their videos apologizing for being racist,

11:51.540 --> 11:55.900
which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.720
YouTubers are constantly dragging each other

11:57.720 --> 12:00.880
because we see ourselves reflected in the other,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.700
and we can't stand the sight of it.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.540
So after the Maya Forrester tweet,

12:04.540 --> 12:07.740
Joanne was silent about trans people for six months,

12:07.740 --> 12:10.460
but she took up the cause again in June 2019,

12:10.460 --> 12:12.260
first to complain about the use of the phrase

12:12.260 --> 12:14.780
people who menstruate in the title of an article

12:14.780 --> 12:17.620
trying to include trans men and non-binary people

12:17.620 --> 12:19.620
in a discussion of period poverty.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.140
That same night, presumably in response

12:22.140 --> 12:25.020
to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers

12:25.020 --> 12:26.620
who think Stalin did nothing wrong

12:26.620 --> 12:28.420
but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,

12:28.420 --> 12:29.660
Joanne tweeted a thread,

12:29.660 --> 12:32.900
again repeating the slogan that sex is real, adding,

12:32.900 --> 12:35.060
it isn't hate to speak the truth,

12:35.060 --> 12:38.460
and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.

12:38.460 --> 12:42.340
I respect every trans person's right to live any way

12:42.340 --> 12:45.020
that feels authentic and comfortable to them.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.580
I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

12:48.340 --> 12:50.380
on the basis of being trans.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.980
If you were discriminated against

12:52.980 --> 12:55.300
on the basis of being trans?

12:55.300 --> 12:56.220
If?

12:56.220 --> 12:58.460
Widespread discrimination against trans people

12:58.460 --> 12:59.820
is well-documented.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.340
In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet,

13:02.340 --> 13:04.100
the Trump administration removed

13:04.100 --> 13:06.280
non-discrimination protections for trans people

13:06.280 --> 13:08.260
in healthcare and health insurance.

13:08.260 --> 13:11.060
So are you marching with us or not, Joanne?

13:11.060 --> 13:12.540
There's a lot of stuff in these tweets

13:12.540 --> 13:15.340
that might seem innocent enough to the average person,

13:15.340 --> 13:16.660
but which to someone who understands

13:16.660 --> 13:20.340
bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.220
Bigotry always has a history,

13:22.220 --> 13:24.300
and in order to understand bigotry,

13:24.300 --> 13:26.020
you have to learn that history.

13:26.020 --> 13:29.340
Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes,

13:29.340 --> 13:33.260
narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing,

13:33.260 --> 13:34.760
we have to learn them.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.020
No one is born thinking that the gays

13:37.020 --> 13:38.260
are destroying the family,

13:38.260 --> 13:40.420
or that women are naturally subservient,

13:40.420 --> 13:43.700
or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.220
So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices,

13:46.220 --> 13:48.700
you might not notice anything wrong with them.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.660
He never said he hated the Jews,

13:50.660 --> 13:54.100
he is simply concerned about the over-representation

13:54.100 --> 13:57.440
of Jewish people in media and banking.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.280
But if you're aware, woke, if you will,

14:00.280 --> 14:02.020
then it kind of rings alarm bells

14:02.020 --> 14:05.260
when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.540
When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people

14:07.540 --> 14:09.020
think sex isn't real,

14:09.020 --> 14:11.300
and they're erasing same-sex attraction,

14:11.300 --> 14:13.100
and they're silencing women,

14:13.100 --> 14:15.820
alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these

14:16.340 --> 14:18.300
familiar transphobic talking points,

14:18.300 --> 14:20.940
specifically TERF talking points.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.100
TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.780
God, are we still talking about this?

14:25.780 --> 14:27.820
I promise, this is the last time.

14:27.820 --> 14:32.020
So TERFism is a, it's a hate movement

14:32.020 --> 14:35.660
that disguises transphobia as feminism.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.400
Bigotry has a history.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.120
The foundational TERF text is feminist professor

14:40.120 --> 14:42.500
Janice Raymond's 1979 book,

14:42.540 --> 14:46.420
The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the Sh-tty Male,

14:46.420 --> 14:48.420
in which Raymond argues that, quote,

14:48.420 --> 14:50.960
All transsexuals rape women's bodies

14:50.960 --> 14:54.000
by reducing the real female form to an artifact,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.700
appropriating this body for themselves.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.620
She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy

14:59.620 --> 15:02.460
who, quote, merely cut off the most obvious means

15:02.460 --> 15:03.780
of invading women.

15:03.780 --> 15:07.180
This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,

15:07.180 --> 15:10.380
and I bring this up because I wanna give you a sense

15:10.420 --> 15:12.940
of how this kind of transphobe talks

15:12.940 --> 15:15.540
when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.780
Typical male narcissist,

15:17.780 --> 15:20.340
Nathan manipulates his cultish audience

15:20.340 --> 15:24.700
into thinking he's the victim of the big ol' meanie TERFs.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.740
If you keep calling me Nathan,

15:26.740 --> 15:28.460
I'm gonna call you Nigel.

15:29.660 --> 15:34.100
Cheerio, old chap, or whatever you people say.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.100
Here's the thing, Nigella.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.420
Bigotry can be mean, yes,

15:38.460 --> 15:40.500
and it usually is when bigots think

15:40.500 --> 15:42.000
they can get away with it.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.380
But it's vital to recognize that being mean

15:45.380 --> 15:47.460
is not the essence of bigotry.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.660
Bigotry can be hateful, yes,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.020
but specifically, bigotry is hate

15:52.020 --> 15:55.900
that poses a political threat to the target group.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.220
The fundamental problem with TERFs

15:58.220 --> 15:59.940
is not that they're mean,

15:59.940 --> 16:02.380
it's that they're politically reactionary.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.340
They wanna reverse the progress of trans liberation.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.940
In the final chapter of The Transsexual Empire,

16:07.980 --> 16:10.860
Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question.

16:10.860 --> 16:11.700
Quote,

16:11.700 --> 16:14.620
The problem of transsexualism would be best served

16:14.620 --> 16:18.020
by morally mandating it out of existence.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.500
I believe that the elimination of transsexualism

16:21.500 --> 16:24.060
is not best achieved by legislation

16:24.060 --> 16:27.220
prohibiting transsexual treatment and surgery,

16:27.220 --> 16:29.960
but rather by legislation that limits it.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.900
I would favor restricting the number of hospitals

16:32.900 --> 16:37.020
and centers where transsexual surgery could be performed.

16:37.020 --> 16:40.060
The kind of counseling to pass successfully

16:40.060 --> 16:41.900
as masculine or feminine

16:41.900 --> 16:44.580
that now reigns in gender identity clinics

16:44.580 --> 16:48.380
only reinforces the problem of transsexualism.

16:48.380 --> 16:49.420
She goes on to argue

16:49.420 --> 16:53.180
for alternative feminist consciousness-raising therapies,

16:53.180 --> 16:54.020
admitting,

16:54.020 --> 16:55.620
I am not so naive as to think

16:55.620 --> 16:58.720
that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,

16:58.720 --> 17:01.580
but they would at least pose the existence

17:01.580 --> 17:04.740
of a real alternative to be explored and tried.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.300
So like homophobes,

17:06.300 --> 17:08.460
TERFs have historically advocated

17:08.460 --> 17:10.620
a kind of conversion therapy

17:10.620 --> 17:14.060
aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.980
And like the anti-abortion movement,

17:15.980 --> 17:19.080
they recognize it's not yet politically practical

17:19.080 --> 17:21.740
to completely make illegal a medical procedure

17:21.740 --> 17:22.920
they don't like,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.980
so they settle for making it as difficult

17:24.980 --> 17:26.740
as possible to get one.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.460
In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report

17:29.460 --> 17:31.480
to the Department of Health and Human Services

17:31.480 --> 17:33.980
repeating her arguments against transsexualism,

17:33.980 --> 17:36.340
which was cited in a 1981 decision

17:36.340 --> 17:38.020
that Medicare would not cover

17:38.020 --> 17:39.700
transition-related healthcare.

17:39.700 --> 17:43.060
That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.660
So there's real political consequences to bigotry.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.940
It's not just a matter of being mean.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.940
Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.460
Unlike Janice Raymond,

17:52.460 --> 17:55.040
J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced

17:55.040 --> 17:57.580
and very intent on convincing all of us

17:57.580 --> 18:00.960
that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally

18:00.960 --> 18:03.420
who loves and supports trans people,

18:03.420 --> 18:07.260
while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.260
She's constantly saying things like,

18:09.260 --> 18:11.380
I know and love trans people,

18:11.380 --> 18:15.100
but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

18:15.100 --> 18:16.740
on the basis of being trans.

18:16.740 --> 18:18.420
At the same time,

18:18.420 --> 18:20.460
none of the gender-critical women I've talked to

18:20.460 --> 18:22.140
hates trans people.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.180
On the contrary,

18:23.180 --> 18:25.060
many of them became interested in this issue

18:25.060 --> 18:28.380
in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.280
A lot of people have a hard time noticing

18:30.280 --> 18:31.620
this kind of bigotry,

18:31.620 --> 18:33.460
and I think one reason for that

18:33.460 --> 18:36.880
is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.980
People think of bigotry as like judging a group

18:39.980 --> 18:41.540
instead of an individual,

18:41.540 --> 18:44.380
which is of course a horrible thing to do.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.060
I don't care for the English.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.420
There's sick, sick people.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.020
Or people think of bigotry as hate,

18:51.020 --> 18:53.140
something inhuman and monstrous.

18:53.140 --> 18:55.180
So when people hear the word bigot,

18:55.180 --> 18:58.700
they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,

18:58.700 --> 19:02.660
some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.180
But the problem with the Nazis

19:04.180 --> 19:07.100
was not that they hated love and friendship.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.760
They believed they were defending German blood and soil

19:10.760 --> 19:14.860
against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.740
And what were we supposed to do?

19:16.740 --> 19:20.580
Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?

19:20.580 --> 19:22.740
That's how a Nazi actually thinks, right?

19:22.740 --> 19:24.820
It's not that they hate friendship.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.940
No, they have their own internal logic

19:26.940 --> 19:29.460
of victimization and self-righteousness.

19:29.460 --> 19:33.420
So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,

19:33.420 --> 19:37.340
you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.060
You know, sometimes people criticize me

19:39.060 --> 19:41.140
for empathizing with bigots,

19:41.140 --> 19:44.300
but I believe that understanding bigots

19:44.300 --> 19:48.080
is the best defense against becoming one yourself.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.180
Because when you dehumanize the villains,

19:51.180 --> 19:55.260
you become unable to recognize the villain within.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.700
How is she, though?

19:56.700 --> 19:58.980
She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.180
Metal straw because I love the environment.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.540
I'm so good, I'm really fucking good.

20:03.540 --> 20:05.980
The idea that bigotry is simply hate

20:05.980 --> 20:09.740
I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.900
It's the idea that bigots are people who outright say,

20:12.900 --> 20:15.540
we hate you, God hates you,

20:15.540 --> 20:17.380
and we're all marching around with signs

20:17.380 --> 20:18.900
about how much we hate you,

20:18.900 --> 20:21.940
like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.

20:21.940 --> 20:22.860
Taylor Swift.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.100
Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.780
Well, I don't.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.100
I don't want to be a gay icon,

20:28.100 --> 20:30.620
I'm just stuck with you people.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.460
Just kidding.

20:31.460 --> 20:34.140
Shade never made anybody less gay.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.940
This isn't Shade, Taylor.

20:35.940 --> 20:38.620
Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,

20:38.620 --> 20:42.500
sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.520
Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.820
And the video for You Need to Calm Down

20:47.820 --> 20:50.700
is just so emblematic of this misconception.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.340
Taylor takes the subject of homophobia

20:53.380 --> 20:56.740
and turns it into yet another song about haters.

20:56.740 --> 20:58.060
But in the real world,

20:58.060 --> 21:00.100
backwoods hillbillies stomping around

21:00.100 --> 21:04.020
with misspelled signs are not really the problem.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.140
The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated

21:07.140 --> 21:08.700
and powerful people.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.940
And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes

21:10.940 --> 21:12.620
who say it's an abomination,

21:12.620 --> 21:14.300
these perverts are spreading AIDS,

21:14.300 --> 21:15.580
they're destroying the family,

21:15.580 --> 21:16.940
they're recruiting children.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.940
But these days it's much more common to hear,

21:19.940 --> 21:22.300
of course I love gay people,

21:22.300 --> 21:25.660
some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.740
But it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology

21:29.740 --> 21:33.560
promoted in schools to children as young as three years old.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.220
Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.500
I'm a good convincing homophobe, don't I?

21:39.500 --> 21:42.460
There's really two different styles of bigotry.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.300
They express the same prejudice,

21:44.300 --> 21:47.020
but they're very different in tone.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.540
I'll call the two styles direct bigotry

21:49.540 --> 21:50.940
and indirect bigotry.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.340
Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.700
It's a bigotry manifested in slurs

21:55.700 --> 21:57.220
and outright discrimination

21:57.220 --> 21:59.100
and demonizing the target group

21:59.100 --> 22:02.860
and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.

22:02.860 --> 22:06.780
Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern

22:06.780 --> 22:10.020
or debate about a host of proxy issues.

22:10.020 --> 22:13.540
It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.340
Frequently the claim is that a once-needed

22:15.340 --> 22:17.860
liberation movement has now gone too far,

22:17.860 --> 22:20.780
but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors

22:21.620 --> 22:22.460
who are disturbing law and order

22:22.460 --> 22:24.220
with violent and chaotic protests,

22:24.220 --> 22:26.780
who are victimizing and silencing innocent people

22:26.780 --> 22:28.060
by calling them bigots,

22:28.060 --> 22:29.580
who are infiltrating the media

22:29.580 --> 22:31.820
and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment

22:31.820 --> 22:34.020
with politically correct propaganda.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.880
And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated

22:36.880 --> 22:38.140
to speak out against it

22:38.140 --> 22:40.340
because cancel culture is out of control

22:40.340 --> 22:42.500
and free speech is under attack.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.260
The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,

22:45.260 --> 22:49.140
ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders,

22:49.220 --> 22:54.220
rapists, brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.

22:54.780 --> 22:58.940
Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,

22:58.940 --> 23:00.900
always a knight in shining armor,

23:00.900 --> 23:03.220
defending women, defending the children,

23:03.220 --> 23:05.420
defending marriage, defending freedom,

23:05.420 --> 23:08.180
defending the family, defending our values,

23:08.180 --> 23:10.660
defending common sense, defending tradition,

23:10.660 --> 23:13.040
defending civilization itself,

23:14.180 --> 23:16.300
defending God.

23:16.300 --> 23:18.640
He's all powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.

23:19.120 --> 23:19.960
I think a lot of people

23:19.960 --> 23:22.840
take a borderline heroic view of themselves,

23:22.840 --> 23:26.440
and indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.

23:26.440 --> 23:30.240
Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets

23:30.240 --> 23:32.880
with some big abstract concept.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.440
Instead of Jewish people,

23:34.440 --> 23:37.720
they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.880
Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis,

23:40.880 --> 23:42.340
or the friend zone.

23:42.340 --> 23:45.920
Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.040
Trans people become transgenderism,

23:49.040 --> 23:52.320
gender ideology, transactivists.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.040
What they're really against is equality,

23:55.040 --> 23:56.280
but they don't say that.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.960
In fact, they may not even think it.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.740
But they tell on themselves

24:00.740 --> 24:03.320
when they react with instinctive hostility

24:03.320 --> 24:05.600
to anyone who agitates for change.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.480
It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs

24:09.480 --> 24:12.360
shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.840
A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices

24:14.880 --> 24:18.120
by Elizabeth Young-Bruhl really helped me with this video.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.520
One of the points she makes

24:19.520 --> 24:23.360
is that a lot of the time, bigotry is backlash.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.600
Ideologies of desire are, generally,

24:26.600 --> 24:29.720
backlashes against movements of equality.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.920
They are regressive prejudices

24:31.920 --> 24:35.280
that reinstate inequalities and distinctions

24:35.280 --> 24:38.840
when the force of movements for equality has been registered

24:38.840 --> 24:42.000
and, often unconsciously, rejected.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.800
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.680
Bigotry is not just the psychological state

24:48.680 --> 24:50.720
of hating a group of people.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.560
Bigotry is political.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.040
It's a reaction to changing demographics

24:56.040 --> 24:57.840
or to liberation movements

24:57.840 --> 25:00.760
or to changing power relations between groups.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.400
A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women

25:04.400 --> 25:06.440
in the literal psychological sense.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.480
It's more that they feel threatened

25:09.480 --> 25:11.520
by the prospect of the social

25:11.520 --> 25:13.560
and political equality of women.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.760
In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened

25:16.760 --> 25:20.120
is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry,

25:20.120 --> 25:22.680
much more so than feeling hateful.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.000
So bigotry is reactive,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.720
and it changes along with the circumstances

25:27.720 --> 25:29.160
it's a reaction to.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.600
1950s misogyny still has some things in common

25:32.600 --> 25:34.200
with 2020s misogyny.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.880
For example, a lot of men still feel some need

25:36.880 --> 25:40.080
to control women's sexuality and women's bodies,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.800
but it's also changed a lot as gender relations

25:42.800 --> 25:45.360
have shifted in the last 70 years.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.300
The idea that women are naturally suited

25:47.300 --> 25:49.800
to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent

25:49.800 --> 25:50.760
than it used to be.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.160
And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder,

25:54.160 --> 25:55.840
because in the last decade,

25:55.840 --> 25:59.000
trans liberation has increased our visibility.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.920
People are running into us at work now.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.920
They're having to use our pronouns.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.580
They're seeing us in politics or in media,

26:05.580 --> 26:08.140
and not just as laughingstocks or monsters

26:08.140 --> 26:10.740
like we used to be, but as actual characters.

26:10.740 --> 26:14.380
And a lot of people are not very happy about it.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.780
They feel threatened.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.940
That must be super fucking hard for you.

26:18.940 --> 26:22.980
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.700
So J.K. Rowling frames her position as,

26:25.700 --> 26:29.260
I am just saying the fact that sex is real.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.780
It's not hateful to say a fact.

26:31.780 --> 26:34.140
Why is everyone so mad at me?

26:34.140 --> 26:36.500
A fact can't be bigoted.

26:36.500 --> 26:40.620
And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted,

26:40.620 --> 26:44.780
but a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.

26:44.780 --> 26:46.980
Usually when we discuss facts,

26:46.980 --> 26:49.900
we're using those facts to tell a story.

26:49.900 --> 26:54.140
And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.

26:54.140 --> 26:57.120
You know, suppose someone tweets the fact

26:57.120 --> 26:58.820
that the homicide rate is higher

26:58.820 --> 27:01.420
for black Americans than white Americans.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.540
I'm gonna ask, what story are you trying

27:04.540 --> 27:06.340
to tell with this fact?

27:06.340 --> 27:09.620
What political goal are you trying to support?

27:09.620 --> 27:11.980
One way indirect bigotry works

27:11.980 --> 27:15.100
is by camouflaging political struggles

27:15.100 --> 27:17.940
as intellectual debates.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.660
When Joanne says sex is real,

27:20.660 --> 27:23.460
she sounds like she's staking out a position

27:23.460 --> 27:27.420
in the trans debate, which is then presented

27:27.420 --> 27:29.420
as an intellectual conflict

27:29.420 --> 27:31.460
about the metaphysics of gender,

27:31.460 --> 27:32.940
instead of what it really is,

27:32.940 --> 27:35.020
which is a political conflict

27:35.020 --> 27:38.660
about the social equality of transgender people.

27:38.660 --> 27:41.020
And the effectiveness of that strategy

27:41.020 --> 27:43.380
is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan

27:43.380 --> 27:46.460
of the slogan trans women are women.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.920
And this is just my opinion,

27:47.920 --> 27:49.940
I don't speak for any other trans people,

27:49.940 --> 27:52.020
but there's a couple things I don't like about it.

27:52.020 --> 27:55.260
One is trans men and non-binary people matter

27:55.260 --> 27:56.900
just as much as trans women.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.060
Which you don't as often hear,

27:58.060 --> 28:03.060
trans men are men, or non-binary people are...

28:04.700 --> 28:05.620
valid?

28:07.260 --> 28:08.820
Doesn't really work, does it?

28:08.820 --> 28:11.220
The other problem with trans women are women

28:11.220 --> 28:14.300
is it tends to invite the response,

28:14.300 --> 28:16.460
well, what does it even mean to be a woman?

28:16.460 --> 28:17.940
Define womanhood.

28:17.940 --> 28:20.660
And now you're immediately getting baited

28:20.660 --> 28:22.860
into some bullshit semantic debate

28:22.860 --> 28:25.460
about what is a real woman.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.580
A real woman.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.500
How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.180
What if you're in the Matrix right now,

28:30.180 --> 28:32.860
and in the real world, you're biologically male?

28:32.860 --> 28:34.620
The tables are turned.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.820
It doesn't really matter, does it?

28:36.820 --> 28:40.440
This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.900
You know, I've been down this road too many times already,

28:42.900 --> 28:45.940
and I always end up having these dead-end conversations

28:45.940 --> 28:47.420
about gender performativity,

28:47.420 --> 28:49.580
or worse, conversations about what it means

28:49.580 --> 28:50.940
to feel like a woman.

28:50.940 --> 28:53.260
Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.700
I don't think anyone feels like a woman, honestly,

28:55.700 --> 28:58.780
except a certain sub-genre of gay men,

28:58.780 --> 29:00.580
and possibly Shania Twain.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.700
Probably not even her anymore, honestly.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.500
Not since the early 2000s.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.900
You know, some questions should be dissolved

29:06.900 --> 29:08.180
rather than solved.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.580
That's what Wittgenstein said.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.580
That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.740
Sometimes the only way to answer a question

29:13.740 --> 29:16.740
is to realize you're asking the wrong question.

29:16.740 --> 29:18.980
How do I know I'm a woman?

29:18.980 --> 29:19.820
Well, look at me.

29:19.820 --> 29:24.020
Oh, I rest my case.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.780
The monitor's over here.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.900
That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.780
I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.060
Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves

29:34.060 --> 29:35.060
what gender is.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.380
In fact, if you even try to answer the question,

29:37.380 --> 29:39.660
you end up enraging some part of the community

29:39.660 --> 29:41.100
who feels excluded.

29:41.100 --> 29:42.460
So no, trans people are not trying

29:42.460 --> 29:44.620
to force an ideology on people.

29:44.620 --> 29:47.460
We don't even share an ideology within our own community.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.620
What we share are a common set of political struggles

29:50.620 --> 29:53.740
against discrimination, against harassment,

29:54.460 --> 29:56.700
against excessive medical gatekeeping,

29:56.700 --> 29:59.140
against exclusion from public life.

29:59.140 --> 30:03.500
So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?

30:03.500 --> 30:06.780
Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people

30:06.780 --> 30:10.500
and something that evades pointless philosophizing

30:10.500 --> 30:15.260
about biology and what is gender and who is true trans

30:15.260 --> 30:17.060
and what is a woman really.

30:17.060 --> 30:19.460
Something that centers what actually matters,

30:19.460 --> 30:21.260
which is freeing trans people

30:21.260 --> 30:23.180
from the stigma and discrimination

30:23.180 --> 30:24.940
that have historically prevented us

30:24.940 --> 30:27.060
from becoming equal members of society.

30:27.060 --> 30:30.420
So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s,

30:30.420 --> 30:34.860
but I personally like the slogan trans liberation now.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.540
It's short, it's sweet,

30:36.540 --> 30:39.340
and instead of prompting define women at it,

30:39.340 --> 30:42.620
it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?

30:42.620 --> 30:44.300
Liberation from what?

30:44.300 --> 30:46.980
And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.

30:46.980 --> 30:49.180
And now you're talking about politics

30:49.180 --> 30:51.100
instead of talking about semantics.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.460
Isn't that better?

30:52.460 --> 30:54.860
I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed

30:54.860 --> 30:57.460
with reassuring ourselves that we are valid

30:57.460 --> 30:59.820
that we sometimes forget that the end goal

30:59.820 --> 31:04.300
of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.400
That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.060
So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,

31:10.060 --> 31:12.980
which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?

31:12.980 --> 31:14.580
Well, maybe I care a little bit.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.500
But instead, why don't we ask,

31:16.500 --> 31:20.660
is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?

31:20.660 --> 31:23.180
Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?

31:23.180 --> 31:24.460
Isn't it so much better

31:24.460 --> 31:27.300
to have a concrete political project in front of you

31:27.300 --> 31:31.180
instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?

31:31.180 --> 31:34.140
Trans people are a population of people

31:34.140 --> 31:35.740
who have a right to equality

31:35.740 --> 31:37.580
and to freedom from discrimination.

31:37.580 --> 31:41.060
We are not an ideology that's up for debate.

31:41.060 --> 31:44.860
But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.

31:44.860 --> 31:47.780
Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,

31:47.780 --> 31:51.300
but as an ideology that she disagrees with.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.660
I'm just saying that sex is real.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.700
Is that all you're saying, Joanne?

31:56.700 --> 31:59.200
♪♪♪

32:10.380 --> 32:12.460
Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire

32:12.460 --> 32:14.020
in the prefect's bathroom?

32:14.020 --> 32:16.740
Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?

32:16.740 --> 32:19.060
I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.

32:19.060 --> 32:20.700
This bath is actually really nice.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.660
It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil,

32:23.660 --> 32:25.980
Epsom salts, just kind of everything

32:25.980 --> 32:27.900
that's good in baths all together.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.460
I don't wanna talk about bigotry.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.140
I wanna talk about baths.

32:31.140 --> 32:34.620
Can this just be a video about baths from now on?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.140
Oh, fine, I'll do my job.

32:36.140 --> 32:39.580
On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,

32:39.580 --> 32:42.100
which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,

32:42.100 --> 32:44.740
which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC

32:44.740 --> 32:48.420
for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.

32:48.420 --> 32:49.900
The essay is several pages long

32:49.900 --> 32:52.340
and outlines her reasons for speaking out

32:52.340 --> 32:54.300
on sex and gender issues.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.500
I refuse to bow down to a movement

32:56.500 --> 32:58.700
that I believe is doing demonstrable harm

32:58.700 --> 33:01.620
in seeking to erode women as a political

33:01.620 --> 33:04.940
and biological class and offering to cover predators

33:04.940 --> 33:06.260
like few before it.

33:06.260 --> 33:07.820
Where do I even begin with this one?

33:07.820 --> 33:10.740
Well, let's pick some highlights.

33:10.740 --> 33:12.540
Woman is not a costume.

33:12.580 --> 33:15.900
Woman is not an idea in a man's head.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.220
Woman is not a pink brain.

33:18.220 --> 33:19.940
My liking for Jimmy Choo's

33:19.940 --> 33:22.660
or any of the other sexist ideas

33:22.660 --> 33:25.700
now somehow touted as progressive.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.900
Oh, well, my mistake.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.020
Here I was, thinking I was a woman.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.380
It turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.340
What a whimsical misunderstanding.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.220
Okay, well, that's it, everyone.

33:36.220 --> 33:37.260
The channel's over.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.860
Thanks for the likes and comments.

33:38.860 --> 33:41.940
I'm gonna head out now to the Jimmy Choo store

33:41.940 --> 33:45.020
and I guess I'll cut my tits off.

33:46.420 --> 33:50.740
Joanne, Joanne, this is madness, Joanne.

33:50.740 --> 33:52.940
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms

33:52.940 --> 33:55.460
and changing rooms to any man who believes

33:55.460 --> 33:58.660
or feels he's a woman, and as I've said,

33:58.660 --> 34:01.540
gender confirmation certificates may now be granted

34:01.540 --> 34:04.420
without any need for surgery or hormones,

34:04.420 --> 34:07.740
then you open the door to any and all men

34:07.740 --> 34:09.660
who wish to come inside.

34:09.660 --> 34:11.980
So look, I understand that some women are anxious

34:11.980 --> 34:14.140
about the thought of predators in bathrooms.

34:14.140 --> 34:16.660
And believe me, I don't wanna share a bathroom

34:16.660 --> 34:18.460
with a predator any more than you do.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.020
Why are all my rose petals on this one side?

34:21.020 --> 34:22.580
Some of them need to come over here.

34:22.580 --> 34:23.540
Come here.

34:23.540 --> 34:25.260
I've redistributed the petals.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.500
Socialist icon.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.260
But this talking point that gender change

34:29.260 --> 34:31.300
on legal documents will enable predators

34:31.300 --> 34:34.120
to enter bathrooms, it doesn't really make sense

34:34.120 --> 34:37.020
because gender policing in public bathrooms

34:37.020 --> 34:39.260
doesn't involve legal documents.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.180
When was the last time you had to present

34:41.180 --> 34:43.560
a gender certificate to gain admittance

34:43.560 --> 34:44.900
to a public bathroom?

34:44.900 --> 34:46.980
This feels like a strangely outdated conversation

34:46.980 --> 34:49.260
to be having during pandemic lockdown.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.100
Imagine using a public bathroom.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.880
Imagine being in public.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.380
I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,

34:55.380 --> 34:57.580
which is about the experiences of butch women.

34:57.580 --> 35:00.340
And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,

35:00.340 --> 35:02.100
which describes how women's bathrooms

35:02.100 --> 35:05.340
tend to operate as an area for the enforcement

35:05.340 --> 35:06.980
of gender conformity.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.660
The author, Jack Halberstam, who's assigned female

35:09.660 --> 35:11.540
at birth and presents masculine,

35:11.540 --> 35:14.420
describes routinely having security called on him

35:14.420 --> 35:16.220
for using the women's bathroom.

35:16.220 --> 35:19.340
Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom

35:19.340 --> 35:21.500
is a frequent occurrence in the lives

35:21.500 --> 35:24.100
of many androgynous or masculine women.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.300
Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders

35:27.300 --> 35:28.860
whether the category woman,

35:28.860 --> 35:31.200
when used to designate public functions,

35:31.200 --> 35:33.020
is completely outmoded.

35:33.020 --> 35:35.800
Queer literature is littered with references

35:35.800 --> 35:37.720
to the bathroom problem,

35:37.720 --> 35:40.200
and it would not be an exaggeration to call it

35:40.200 --> 35:43.040
a standard feature of the butch narrative.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.160
And that's very interesting to me

35:44.160 --> 35:46.680
because as a feminine trans woman,

35:46.680 --> 35:48.680
I have not once been questioned

35:48.680 --> 35:50.240
or had the authorities called on me

35:50.240 --> 35:52.080
in a women's public bathroom

35:52.080 --> 35:54.040
in the entire time I've been using them,

35:54.040 --> 35:55.880
which is several years now.

35:55.880 --> 35:59.620
So when Joanne Ruling, a feminine heterosexual woman,

35:59.620 --> 36:01.680
calls for more bathroom policing

36:01.680 --> 36:04.480
to protect the lesbians or whatever,

36:04.480 --> 36:06.160
it just seems ignorant

36:06.160 --> 36:08.520
of the way bathroom policing actually works.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.720
Like, is she just so famous

36:10.720 --> 36:12.720
that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore

36:12.720 --> 36:14.480
and she forgot how they work?

36:14.480 --> 36:17.640
How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?

36:17.640 --> 36:18.820
$10?

36:18.820 --> 36:21.680
Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.280
not chromosomes, and there's no practical way

36:24.280 --> 36:27.480
to change that short of stationing a genital inspector

36:27.480 --> 36:29.000
in every stall, you know,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.640
just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.360
That's a very good idea, Joanne.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.240
That's very good.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.880
Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.360
They include trans men in their feminism

36:45.360 --> 36:47.520
because they were born women.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.780
Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists

36:51.780 --> 36:54.720
think that trans men are women?

36:54.720 --> 36:57.640
Hello, operator, could you get me Alanis Morissette?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.720
I have a new incident to report.

36:59.720 --> 37:03.080
So look, I could keep refuting points made in Turf Wars,

37:03.080 --> 37:04.400
which is basically just a series

37:04.400 --> 37:06.000
of common transphobic canards

37:06.000 --> 37:07.640
we've all heard a hundred times before,

37:07.640 --> 37:10.520
but I want to focus in particular on some passages

37:10.520 --> 37:11.920
that I think are very revealing

37:11.920 --> 37:14.080
about the psychology of transphobia.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.240
What is it about the transgenders

37:16.240 --> 37:18.520
that some people feel threatened by?

37:18.520 --> 37:21.160
Well, Joanne Rowling gives us a lot to work with

37:21.160 --> 37:22.600
in answering that question.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.840
You know, Joanne being a TERF

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
is mostly terrible for trans people,

37:25.840 --> 37:28.060
but maybe the silver lining

37:28.060 --> 37:30.420
is that the most famous novelist in the world

37:30.420 --> 37:33.000
having a public transphobic breakdown

37:33.000 --> 37:35.420
is providing a wealth of insight

37:35.420 --> 37:38.000
about the interior world of a transphobe.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.220
In Turf Wars, Joanne claims her interest

37:40.220 --> 37:44.060
in the trans issue is intensely personal,

37:44.060 --> 37:46.020
and she has two reasons why it's personal.

37:46.020 --> 37:49.500
The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.100
she would have been transed.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.380
Someone would have transed her.

37:52.380 --> 37:55.220
You know, people are being transed left and right these days.

37:55.220 --> 37:57.140
It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.

37:57.180 --> 37:59.100
Trans people, we're always on the lookout

37:59.100 --> 38:01.140
for the next person we can trans.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.860
That's all we wanna do, is trans people.

38:03.860 --> 38:08.020
I transed four people this morning before I ate breakfast.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.940
She thinks that she would have been recruited

38:09.940 --> 38:12.920
by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones

38:12.920 --> 38:15.380
by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.060
And in support of this speculation,

38:17.060 --> 38:19.300
Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes

38:19.300 --> 38:21.220
about social contagion, and to quote,

38:21.220 --> 38:24.700
4,400% increase in girls being referred

38:24.700 --> 38:26.220
for transitioning treatment.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.060
And that sounds pretty alarming, right?

38:28.060 --> 38:29.820
4,400%.

38:29.820 --> 38:32.500
But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,

38:32.500 --> 38:36.420
only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred.

38:36.420 --> 38:40.200
And by last year, that number was 1,740,

38:40.200 --> 38:42.580
with the biggest increase happening five years ago.

38:42.580 --> 38:45.260
You know, the transgender tipping point year.

38:45.260 --> 38:47.700
So that is a big increase, but it corresponds

38:47.700 --> 38:50.420
to the biggest ever increase in trans visibility.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.020
So it does make sense,

38:52.020 --> 38:54.860
and there's 11 million children in the UK,

38:54.860 --> 38:57.940
so let's say 5.5 million girls,

38:57.940 --> 39:02.940
and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.

39:03.060 --> 39:05.540
And considering that around 1% of adults

39:05.540 --> 39:09.660
are some kind of transgender, 0.03% of kids

39:09.660 --> 39:12.420
is not really an alarming number to me.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.900
If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.020
But part of Joanne's problem here

39:17.020 --> 39:19.340
is that she seems not to really understand

39:19.340 --> 39:21.060
what being trans is.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.540
The writings of young trans men reveal a group

39:23.540 --> 39:25.620
of notably sensitive and clever people.

39:25.620 --> 39:29.080
The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,

39:29.080 --> 39:31.940
with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,

39:31.940 --> 39:36.620
dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm, and self-hatred,

39:36.620 --> 39:38.300
the more I've wondered whether

39:38.300 --> 39:40.660
if I'd been born 30 years later,

39:40.660 --> 39:42.820
I too might have tried to transition.

39:42.820 --> 39:46.020
The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.740
If I had found community and sympathy online

39:48.740 --> 39:51.220
that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,

39:51.220 --> 39:53.100
I believe I could have been persuaded

39:53.620 --> 39:55.500
to turn myself into the son my father

39:55.500 --> 39:58.060
had openly said he'd have preferred.

39:58.060 --> 40:01.180
Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness

40:01.180 --> 40:03.460
and my ambivalence about being a woman

40:03.460 --> 40:07.180
reflected in the work of female writers and musicians

40:07.180 --> 40:09.880
who reassured me that in spite of everything,

40:09.880 --> 40:13.500
a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.020
It's fine not to feel pink, frilly,

40:16.020 --> 40:17.880
and compliant inside your own head.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.580
It's okay to feel confused, dark,

40:20.580 --> 40:23.060
both sexual and non-sexual,

40:23.060 --> 40:26.380
unsure of what or who you are.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.180
Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here,

40:30.180 --> 40:31.820
and let's start by making a list

40:31.820 --> 40:35.340
of things being a transgender man is not.

40:35.340 --> 40:38.420
Having anxiety, having dissociation,

40:38.420 --> 40:41.500
having an eating disorder, doing self-harm,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.760
doing self-hatred, a viable way

40:43.760 --> 40:46.260
to make your sexist father proud,

40:46.260 --> 40:49.300
not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,

40:49.300 --> 40:53.060
not being compliant, feeling confused,

40:53.060 --> 40:57.140
feeling dark, feeling sexual,

40:57.140 --> 41:01.660
feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.020
Okay, so you can be a trans man

41:04.020 --> 41:07.260
and experience some or even all of these things,

41:07.260 --> 41:11.460
but none of these things are what being a trans man is.

41:11.460 --> 41:14.900
Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body

41:14.900 --> 41:17.540
and literally live your life as a man

41:17.540 --> 41:19.820
is not the same as the typical struggles

41:19.820 --> 41:21.060
other girls go through.

41:21.060 --> 41:23.140
Joanne is projecting her own memories

41:23.140 --> 41:25.620
of troubled adolescence onto trans men,

41:25.620 --> 41:27.980
and then saying, oh, clearly they were going

41:27.980 --> 41:29.340
through the same things I was,

41:29.340 --> 41:32.980
just someone persuaded them to transition.

41:32.980 --> 41:34.900
It's a limitation of human empathy

41:34.900 --> 41:37.660
that sometimes when we're trying to understand

41:37.660 --> 41:39.420
what someone else is feeling,

41:39.420 --> 41:43.660
the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them,

41:43.660 --> 41:46.220
and sometimes that's a misrepresentation.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.740
Sometimes other people are experiencing things

41:48.740 --> 41:50.900
that we have never experienced.

41:52.300 --> 41:55.220
So we have to invent explanations

41:55.220 --> 41:58.740
about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.

41:58.740 --> 42:01.580
Someone is persuading them to transition.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.420
But this fear-mongering about kids

42:03.420 --> 42:07.580
being persuaded to transition is just not how things work.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.220
From the way transphobes talk about it,

42:09.220 --> 42:11.380
you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground

42:11.380 --> 42:14.560
picks up a toy truck, an endocrinologist pops out

42:14.600 --> 42:16.160
from behind a tree and says,

42:16.160 --> 42:18.560
we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.520
Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.240
But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,

42:24.240 --> 42:27.240
in particular about young transmasculine people.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.240
Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out

42:30.240 --> 42:32.640
that is essentially to transmasculine people

42:32.640 --> 42:35.360
what the transsexual empire was to trans women.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.960
It's called Irreversible Damage,

42:37.960 --> 42:41.760
The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.320
Chapter one.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.600
A contagion.

42:44.600 --> 42:45.480
Jesus.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.020
Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?

42:48.020 --> 42:50.640
The argument is that female-to-male transgenderism

42:50.640 --> 42:52.880
is an infectious social disease,

42:52.880 --> 42:54.520
which is literally the argument

42:54.520 --> 42:58.420
Hitler made about homosexuality, but okay, great.

42:58.420 --> 43:01.600
I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues

43:01.600 --> 43:03.520
is that not enough attention is paid

43:03.520 --> 43:06.200
to transphobia against trans men.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.220
Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,

43:08.220 --> 43:10.120
Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,

43:10.120 --> 43:12.040
transgender women are women,

43:12.040 --> 43:13.540
and that's very nice of him,

43:13.540 --> 43:17.080
but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.

43:17.080 --> 43:20.160
In fact, she spends more words on trans men

43:20.160 --> 43:21.640
than on any other topic,

43:21.640 --> 43:24.600
so I think it's worth looking in particular at that.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.340
Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men

43:28.340 --> 43:31.440
is not the same as transphobia against trans women.

43:31.440 --> 43:32.780
There's a lot of similarities,

43:32.780 --> 43:35.160
but they're really two different prejudices,

43:35.160 --> 43:37.600
and they come from different psychological places,

43:37.600 --> 43:39.280
in the same way that lesbophobia

43:39.280 --> 43:41.720
is different from homophobia against gay men.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.160
For trans women, I would say

43:43.160 --> 43:45.520
the distinctive experience of transphobia

43:45.520 --> 43:47.840
is being simultaneously treated

43:47.840 --> 43:51.020
as a pornographic female fetish object

43:51.020 --> 43:54.040
and as a dangerous male predator.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.400
The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus

43:57.400 --> 44:00.720
who will ravage your wife and trap your husband.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.960
Your polygamous commune will be devastated.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.760
Whereas I feel like transmasculine people

44:04.760 --> 44:08.920
are less vilified, but so infantilized.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.520
I guess transphobes view trans men as women,

44:12.320 --> 44:14.840
a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,

44:14.840 --> 44:17.040
so much for transitioning to escape sexism.

44:17.040 --> 44:21.520
The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls

44:21.520 --> 44:23.480
can't possibly decide for themselves

44:23.480 --> 44:25.200
what to do with their own bodies,

44:25.200 --> 44:27.560
so the courts must intervene to take control,

44:27.560 --> 44:29.960
which is exactly what just happened in the UK,

44:29.960 --> 44:32.080
where trans youth under 16 will now need

44:32.080 --> 44:34.040
not only the approval of a doctor,

44:34.040 --> 44:35.680
but will need to seek a court order

44:35.680 --> 44:37.480
in order to get puberty blockers.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.280
And the justification given for this

44:39.280 --> 44:42.600
mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns

44:42.600 --> 44:45.760
about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls

44:45.760 --> 44:48.240
being unable to make informed decisions.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.920
In her essay, Joanne says,

44:49.920 --> 44:53.200
I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman

44:53.200 --> 44:55.920
who's older than I am and wonderful.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.400
Although she's open about her past as a gay man,

44:58.400 --> 45:00.240
I've always found it hard to think of her

45:00.240 --> 45:01.960
as anything other than a woman.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.880
Being older, though, she went through

45:03.880 --> 45:07.120
a long and rigorous process of evaluation,

45:07.120 --> 45:10.000
psychotherapy, and staged transformation.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.160
The current explosion of trans activism

45:12.160 --> 45:16.160
is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems

45:16.160 --> 45:18.720
through which candidates for sex reassignment

45:18.720 --> 45:20.240
were once required to pass.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.560
So that's what she wants.

45:21.560 --> 45:25.320
She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.720
which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,

45:27.720 --> 45:30.280
just Joanne's more polite about it.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.440
I want to make a drink.

45:31.640 --> 45:32.480
Oh, fuck.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.600
Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.280
No, just drank a lot.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.240
Ugh, we're revealing leg again.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.120
The scandal.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.840
Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it

45:45.840 --> 45:48.360
is that much more chaste.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.480
Well, I'm an extremely chaste woman.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.800
I try to honor God with my body.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.760
That's why I got a sex change.

45:54.760 --> 45:57.680
I'm honoring God with my sex change.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.880
I'm not drunk enough for this.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.920
So I also want to point out that cis men and cis women

46:01.920 --> 46:04.600
are often transphobic for different reasons.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.560
A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women

46:07.560 --> 46:11.120
because the thought that a man can become a woman

46:11.120 --> 46:13.800
threatens the certainty of their own manhood.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.720
It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men

46:15.720 --> 46:16.920
are homophobic.

46:16.920 --> 46:20.320
They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.520
And of course, a lot of straight men

46:21.520 --> 46:22.960
are attracted to trans women,

46:22.960 --> 46:25.280
and they feel that that attraction threatens

46:25.280 --> 46:27.440
their identity as straight men.

46:27.440 --> 46:30.320
Back in my comp hat days when I dated men,

46:30.320 --> 46:32.680
for a couple straight guys I hooked up with,

46:32.680 --> 46:36.040
going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.440
This is it, Mr. Frodo.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.960
If I take one more step,

46:38.960 --> 46:41.720
I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.800
Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.720
And afterwards, they go into this whole Cartesian spiral.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.080
What have I done?

46:49.080 --> 46:50.400
What does this mean?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.320
Who am I?

46:51.320 --> 46:53.220
I think for a lot of cis women,

46:53.220 --> 46:55.840
the very existence of trans men

46:55.840 --> 46:58.440
sends them into a similar identity crisis.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.880
I think a lot of women have had to fight

47:00.880 --> 47:03.000
a really difficult internal battle

47:03.000 --> 47:04.960
to make peace with their own womanhood.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.860
And for some women, confronting the existence

47:07.860 --> 47:12.480
of transgender people seems to open some old wounds.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.000
Like I've noticed in particular

47:14.000 --> 47:17.160
that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs

47:17.160 --> 47:21.480
are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.880
And these women see hyperfeminine trans women

47:23.880 --> 47:26.120
in makeup and dresses, and they say,

47:26.120 --> 47:28.880
that is not what being a woman is.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.640
I've had to fight for my own identity

47:31.640 --> 47:35.040
against the idea that that's what being a woman is.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.300
These are just misogynistic stereotypes.

47:37.300 --> 47:39.560
You are a parody of womanhood.

47:39.560 --> 47:40.760
You're a fetishist.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.180
And when they see trans men, they say,

47:43.180 --> 47:44.320
you're a traitor.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.720
You're a self-loather.

47:45.720 --> 47:48.200
Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman

47:48.200 --> 47:49.760
the way I've had to?

47:49.760 --> 47:52.120
But this is all projection and misunderstanding.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.960
Trans women do not think that wearing dresses

47:54.960 --> 47:56.540
is what makes us women.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.640
And trans men do not think that not feeling pink,

47:59.640 --> 48:02.760
frilly, and compliant is what makes them men.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.480
These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning

48:05.480 --> 48:08.120
to trans people's actions in her own brain,

48:08.120 --> 48:09.920
because she perceives our lives

48:09.920 --> 48:12.440
as some kind of commentary on gender,

48:12.440 --> 48:15.400
with an implied ideology about what it means

48:15.400 --> 48:16.920
to be a man or a woman.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.180
But that's your interpretation, Joanne.

48:19.180 --> 48:22.180
That's a meaning that you are imposing on us,

48:22.180 --> 48:25.660
because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage

48:25.660 --> 48:28.740
of your own, and it's interfering with your ability

48:28.740 --> 48:31.340
to genuinely empathize with trans people.

48:31.340 --> 48:32.700
You know, at the end of your essay,

48:32.700 --> 48:35.820
you say that you never forget the inner complexity

48:35.820 --> 48:37.440
when it comes to trans people.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.800
And that's a nice thought,

48:38.800 --> 48:42.540
but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people

48:42.540 --> 48:46.140
as some kind of abstract theory of gender,

48:46.140 --> 48:49.140
or as a projection of your own adolescence,

48:49.980 --> 48:52.860
then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals

48:52.860 --> 48:55.260
with our own experiences and stories.

48:55.260 --> 48:58.660
And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson

48:58.660 --> 49:01.500
on trans people, sorry, gender issues,

49:01.500 --> 49:03.060
I think it would be good if you listened

49:03.060 --> 49:06.820
to the experiences of trans men without, for instance,

49:06.820 --> 49:10.060
superimposing your own troubled relationship

49:10.060 --> 49:11.140
with your father.

49:11.140 --> 49:14.060
I should probably talk about the book,

49:14.060 --> 49:17.220
since I did go to the trouble to read all 900 pages,

49:17.220 --> 49:20.260
because unlike certain other YouTubers,

49:20.260 --> 49:22.300
I do in fact know how to read.

49:22.300 --> 49:25.220
Troubled Blood was published in September 2020

49:25.220 --> 49:28.540
by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.

49:28.540 --> 49:30.460
You know, for someone apparently so concerned

49:30.460 --> 49:33.900
about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,

49:33.900 --> 49:37.580
the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is,

49:37.580 --> 49:38.740
it's interesting.

49:38.740 --> 49:40.320
It's a choice.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.580
God, this thing is huge.

49:41.580 --> 49:43.660
It's like the infinite jest of terfory.

49:43.660 --> 49:46.380
So Troubled Blood is a detective novel

49:46.380 --> 49:49.340
about the simmering heterosexual tension

49:49.340 --> 49:51.140
between two investigators.

49:51.140 --> 49:53.420
And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?

49:53.420 --> 49:54.540
Simmering.

49:54.540 --> 49:57.100
There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe,

49:57.100 --> 50:00.660
and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

You stay out of this, Linda.

50:54.780 --> 50:58.180
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

50:58.180 --> 51:01.940
So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,

51:01.940 --> 51:05.180
a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman

51:05.180 --> 51:08.180
to lull his victims, whom he abducts,

51:08.180 --> 51:10.980
tortures, rapes, and murders.

51:10.980 --> 51:11.980
Interesting.

51:11.980 --> 51:15.780
Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,

51:15.780 --> 51:18.340
I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.

51:18.340 --> 51:21.100
But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,

51:21.100 --> 51:23.260
have called this book transphobic.

51:23.260 --> 51:24.460
And you might think that's unfair

51:24.460 --> 51:29.140
since the character Dennis Creed, this serial killer,

51:29.140 --> 51:32.020
is a, he's not a trans, he's a cross-dresser.

51:32.020 --> 51:34.060
This has nothing to do with trans people.

51:34.060 --> 51:36.300
Why so triggered, snowflake?

51:36.300 --> 51:38.500
Well, precious, there's a couple things

51:38.500 --> 51:40.940
I think are worth taking into consideration here.

51:40.940 --> 51:44.900
One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer

51:44.900 --> 51:46.660
is an old transphobic trope.

51:46.660 --> 51:49.180
It's a cliche that goes back decades.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.780
And I take great offense to the suggestion

51:51.780 --> 51:53.900
that trans women are serial killers

51:53.900 --> 51:57.780
because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.300
The trope seems to originate in 1960

52:00.300 --> 52:02.260
with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

52:02.260 --> 52:04.460
That's just my guess, though, I haven't researched this.

52:04.460 --> 52:06.100
Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?

52:06.860 --> 52:08.140
So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.

52:08.140 --> 52:10.700
The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up

52:10.700 --> 52:12.180
where the psychiatrist offers

52:12.180 --> 52:14.260
the pseudo-Freudian explanation

52:14.260 --> 52:16.940
that Norman Cross-dresses because the personality

52:16.940 --> 52:18.700
of his dead mother takes over

52:18.700 --> 52:20.940
and out of jealousy, kills the women

52:20.940 --> 52:22.500
Norman is attracted to.

52:22.500 --> 52:25.140
Therefore, the psychiatrist explains,

52:25.140 --> 52:28.140
Norman is not a real transvestite.

52:28.140 --> 52:30.340
You're a fake transvestite, Norman.

52:30.340 --> 52:31.620
Trender alert.

52:31.620 --> 52:32.980
But I do think that even if Psycho

52:32.980 --> 52:34.660
isn't explicitly transphobic,

52:34.660 --> 52:37.380
movies can subconsciously implant ideas

52:37.380 --> 52:39.940
and feelings into our brains.

52:39.940 --> 52:41.740
And I do think it's worth noting

52:41.740 --> 52:44.060
that the most famous and most terrifying

52:44.060 --> 52:45.980
murder scene in cinema history

52:45.980 --> 52:50.980
is of a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.

52:51.180 --> 52:53.060
To quote a popular film critic,

52:53.060 --> 52:56.260
you might not have noticed it, but your brain did.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.940
The cross-dressing psychotrope

52:57.940 --> 52:59.780
became explicitly transphobic

52:59.780 --> 53:03.500
in the campy 1980s Psycho ripoff Dressed to Kill,

53:03.500 --> 53:06.620
in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist

53:06.620 --> 53:09.060
who, yes, dresses as a woman

53:09.060 --> 53:11.980
to kill women he's attracted to.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.420
He was a transsexual.

53:13.420 --> 53:14.260
What?

53:14.260 --> 53:15.300
A transsexual.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.940
You see, there's some men and women, too,

53:16.940 --> 53:18.420
think they're born in the wrong body.

53:18.420 --> 53:20.060
They're called transsexuals.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.660
And all they want to do is have their sex changed.

53:22.660 --> 53:24.980
It's all they want to do, the transsexuals.

53:24.980 --> 53:28.380
Dressed to Kill also ends with the psychiatric summing up,

53:28.380 --> 53:30.500
where the doctor explains that Michael Caine

53:30.500 --> 53:32.660
is a case of opposite sexes

53:32.660 --> 53:34.180
inhabiting the same body.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.980
But it's the female Michael Caine who kills,

53:36.980 --> 53:38.620
because, and I quote,

53:38.620 --> 53:40.460
Elliot's penis became erect,

53:40.460 --> 53:41.820
and Bobby took control,

53:41.820 --> 53:45.060
trying to kill anyone that made Elliot masculinely sexual.

53:45.060 --> 53:46.580
There's often a misogynistic trope

53:46.580 --> 53:48.460
hiding behind the transphobic one.

53:48.460 --> 53:51.780
It's the woman in the man who does the murders.

53:51.780 --> 53:53.180
It's the mother's fault.

53:53.180 --> 53:57.300
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.

53:57.300 --> 53:59.540
The most mature iteration of this trope,

53:59.540 --> 54:01.700
the crown jewel of transphobic movies,

54:01.700 --> 54:04.260
is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,

54:04.260 --> 54:06.060
which is honestly one of my favorite movies,

54:06.060 --> 54:08.180
because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins

54:08.180 --> 54:10.180
are just radiant in it.

54:10.180 --> 54:13.060
And also, I hate myself.

54:13.060 --> 54:15.740
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,

54:15.740 --> 54:18.980
an animal lover and innovative seamstress.

54:18.980 --> 54:21.260
Buffalo Bill is a trans-trender.

54:21.260 --> 54:22.460
A trans-trender!

54:22.460 --> 54:24.900
Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin,

54:24.900 --> 54:28.460
because his application for sex reassignment was rejected.

54:28.460 --> 54:31.380
Because, according to Hannibal Lecter,

54:31.420 --> 54:33.940
Billy is not a real transsexual.

54:33.940 --> 54:36.980
Hannibal Lecter is a truscum!

54:36.980 --> 54:39.060
There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,

54:39.060 --> 54:40.980
I just want to use this opportunity

54:40.980 --> 54:42.740
to reassure my trans audience

54:42.740 --> 54:45.980
that even if you've only killed one or two people,

54:45.980 --> 54:46.900
you're valid.

54:48.500 --> 54:49.780
I entertain myself.

54:49.780 --> 54:52.340
That's how I continue to struggle onwards.

54:52.340 --> 54:55.260
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

54:55.260 --> 54:57.660
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

54:57.660 --> 55:01.820
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage

55:01.820 --> 55:03.180
and more terrifying.

55:03.180 --> 55:07.060
More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?

55:07.060 --> 55:08.620
Is that even possible?

55:08.620 --> 55:10.340
Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here,

55:10.340 --> 55:12.460
because the sun is rising.

55:12.460 --> 55:14.020
Silence of the Lambs differs

55:14.020 --> 55:16.780
from its male gaze-y predecessors

55:16.780 --> 55:20.140
in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.

55:20.140 --> 55:23.380
Clarice is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,

55:23.380 --> 55:25.860
and every man in this movie is a pig,

55:25.860 --> 55:27.220
except maybe Hannibal Lecter,

55:27.780 --> 55:29.340
the only one who actually respects Clarice,

55:29.340 --> 55:30.580
the only real gentleman,

55:30.580 --> 55:33.940
with his Goldberg variations in his sketches of the Duomo.

55:33.940 --> 55:37.220
Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,

55:37.220 --> 55:39.020
even Crawford's kind of a pig.

55:39.020 --> 55:41.780
The pigs are pigs, Migs is pigs,

55:41.780 --> 55:44.540
and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:44.540 --> 55:47.380
Die Uberschwein, it's in the original German.

55:47.380 --> 55:48.700
The fuck am I talking about?

55:48.700 --> 55:49.900
What?

55:49.900 --> 55:52.140
And he's obsessed with death's head moths,

55:52.140 --> 55:56.100
this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor

55:56.140 --> 55:57.940
for gender transformation.

55:57.940 --> 55:59.540
I can't believe I finally emerged

55:59.540 --> 56:01.260
as a beautiful butterfly.

56:01.260 --> 56:02.500
Show don't tell, Lily.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.900
Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people

56:03.900 --> 56:06.420
have so many rights that it's okay to make fun of us.

56:06.420 --> 56:07.620
There's a lot to work with.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.780
So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.860
I'm not saying it's inherently wrong

56:11.860 --> 56:13.540
to make a movie or write a book

56:13.540 --> 56:15.340
about a transgender serial killer,

56:15.340 --> 56:17.940
but there is an issue of representation.

56:17.940 --> 56:20.420
You know, for decades, there was close to zero

56:20.420 --> 56:23.660
good representation of trans people in movies or TV,

56:23.660 --> 56:27.020
but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers,

56:27.020 --> 56:29.780
and that has an effect on the way people think.

56:29.780 --> 56:32.540
When it comes time to debate bathroom bills,

56:32.540 --> 56:35.500
and people are subconsciously remembering Psycho,

56:35.500 --> 56:38.420
that has serious consequences for trans people.

56:38.420 --> 56:39.740
It's getting so bright in here,

56:39.740 --> 56:41.660
the sun has like, the sun has risen.

56:41.660 --> 56:45.260
And it's also not psychologically good for us

56:45.260 --> 56:47.980
to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures

56:47.980 --> 56:49.260
of ourselves in media.

56:49.260 --> 56:51.340
Like even as late as my early 20s,

56:51.340 --> 56:53.140
I didn't know any trans people,

56:53.180 --> 56:56.180
but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.

56:56.180 --> 56:58.500
I think the most positive approximation

56:58.500 --> 57:00.100
of representation I knew about

57:00.100 --> 57:02.860
was like Frank-N-Furter and Divine.

57:02.860 --> 57:05.580
And both of them are also psychotic murderers,

57:05.580 --> 57:08.300
just, you know, in a fun way.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.340
Shoulda just gotten her those cha-cha heels.

57:10.340 --> 57:13.380
So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,

57:13.380 --> 57:16.020
but I guess I felt that it was basically

57:16.020 --> 57:19.140
the moral equivalent of being a serial killer.

57:19.140 --> 57:21.540
Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.700
And things have changed in the last 10 years.

57:23.700 --> 57:26.780
I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.

57:26.780 --> 57:29.300
There's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me

57:29.300 --> 57:32.700
who don't even hate themselves, can't relate.

57:32.700 --> 57:36.020
So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.

57:36.020 --> 57:39.100
Joanne has written a book about a serial killer

57:39.100 --> 57:41.820
who dresses as a woman to kill women.

57:41.820 --> 57:42.960
Groundbreaking.

57:42.960 --> 57:46.220
Now this is such a cliche that you'd kind of expect

57:46.220 --> 57:49.860
a seasoned writer like JK Rowling to subvert it somehow.

57:49.860 --> 57:52.420
Give us a remix, turn it on its head.

57:52.420 --> 57:55.100
Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.580
You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.

57:57.580 --> 57:59.860
Or at least do something new with it.

57:59.860 --> 58:00.940
But she really doesn't.

58:00.940 --> 58:03.460
It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.

58:03.460 --> 58:05.380
I guess I should read you some passages.

58:05.380 --> 58:07.740
I'm reading it on my phone, I'm not bringing the book out

58:07.740 --> 58:09.700
and pretending to read on the book.

58:09.700 --> 58:11.980
You can see from my little bookmarks

58:11.980 --> 58:13.900
that I read the physical book.

58:13.900 --> 58:16.980
Yes, I'm a YouTuber, and yes, I read a book.

58:16.980 --> 58:18.580
So here's a psychiatrist.

58:18.580 --> 58:20.420
There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?

58:20.420 --> 58:23.220
Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.500
He's a classic sociopath, you see.

58:25.500 --> 58:27.460
A pure example of the type.

58:27.460 --> 58:30.100
He scores very highly on the dark triad.

58:30.100 --> 58:33.260
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

58:33.260 --> 58:37.980
Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.

58:37.980 --> 58:41.220
You see, he's what we in the medical profession call

58:41.220 --> 58:42.260
the baddie.

58:42.260 --> 58:43.420
Uh, quote Dennis.

58:43.420 --> 58:45.220
It excited me to watch a woman

58:45.220 --> 58:47.220
who didn't know she was being observed.

58:47.220 --> 58:48.500
I'd do it to my sisters.

58:48.500 --> 58:50.820
But I'd creep up to lit windows as well.

58:50.820 --> 58:53.940
If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing,

58:53.940 --> 58:56.220
adjusting themselves, or even a glimpse of nudity.

58:56.220 --> 58:59.340
I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects,

58:59.340 --> 59:00.580
but by the sense of power.

59:00.580 --> 59:03.140
I felt I stole something of their essence from them,

59:03.140 --> 59:06.140
taking that which they had thought private and hidden.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.660
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear

59:08.660 --> 59:10.020
from neighbors' washing lines,

59:10.020 --> 59:12.260
and even from his grandmother, Ina.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.580
These he enjoyed wearing in secret,

59:14.580 --> 59:16.220
and masturbating in.

59:16.980 --> 59:20.100
Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?

59:20.100 --> 59:21.300
Ho ho, dear readers.

59:21.300 --> 59:22.940
So Dennis Creed is characterized

59:22.940 --> 59:26.420
as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.

59:26.420 --> 59:28.340
And like, okay, there really are men

59:28.340 --> 59:31.380
who fetishize women's clothes, for example.

59:31.380 --> 59:33.260
I mean, Freud talked about this, right?

59:33.260 --> 59:37.260
Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part

59:37.260 --> 59:38.940
or an article of clothing.

59:38.940 --> 59:42.580
And Freud theorized that fetishes emerge

59:42.620 --> 59:46.540
from the unconscious trauma that occurs

59:46.540 --> 59:51.420
when men discover that women don't have a penis.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.500
Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.220
But considering that Joanne has been doing

59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.220
a lot of gender-critical reading over the past few years,

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.820
it's kind of hard for me to ignore

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.700
that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.820
is exactly the way a lot of TERFs

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.580
characterize trans women.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:16.140
Remember, the whole gender-critical feminists

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.900
with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.300
These people are bigots.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.420
And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:30.020
that trans women are hypersexual and hyperaggressive, right?

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.660
These inherently pornographic sex demons.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.140
But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.460
Are trans women sex demons?

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.580
Why, yes.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.860
Yes, we are.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.900
The bigots are simply correct.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.900
We're sex demons.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.420
You can't even talk to these people.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.380
Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.060
I used to take the bait and argue that,

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.780
no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.180
Unless you want me to be.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.560
But it's counterproductive to make that argument.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.400
Why?

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.460
Because my not-involved-in-human-trafficking t-shirt

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.500
has people asking a lot of questions

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.260
already answered by my shirt.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.060
So I have a hard time believing

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.300
that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.740
with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.180
And I also want to note

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.900
that Dennis's cross-dressing is described

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.020
not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.660
from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.140
but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.980
Dennis says on page 854,

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.100
so you know I actually read this fucking shit.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.100
In a wig, bit of lipstick.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.420
They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.060
You're the nice man who's safe.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.740
And earlier, he's described as,

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.020
Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner,

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.940
a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.020
Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.180
and sometimes wearing a wig that,

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.540
from a distance, to a drunk victim,

01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.220
gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.780
for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.980
So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination,

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:10.180
cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.980
They mistake him for a woman, or as, you know.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.060
And that causes them to lower their guard.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.020
And this reminds me of one of my aforestatter's

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.660
allegedly transphobic tweets.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.300
Pronouns are a hypnom, important article by Harry Lactapi.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:30.300
A.K.A. Volfamort, she-who-must-not-be-named,

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.100
followed by J.K. Rowling, because of course.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.620
Pronouns are rohypnol.

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.940
Rohypnol is roofies.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.820
And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.660
Pronouns are like rohypnol.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.140
They dull your defenses.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.980
They change your inhibitions.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.820
They're meant to.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.100
You've had a lifetime's experience learning

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.980
to be alert to him and to relax to her, for good reason.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.780
These instinctive responses keep you safe.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.740
It's not even a conscious thing.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.020
It's like the hairs standing on end.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.980
Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.300
by the saber-toothed tiger

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.140
that your eyes haven't noticed yet.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.380
I want to be alert.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.980
I want others to be alert.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.180
I want people to see the real picture,

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.460
and I want those instinctive reactions

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.380
that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.140
undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.100
I feel like I owe this to myself,

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.860
and I absolutely owe it to other women.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.940
And more than anything, I owe this to girls.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.260
I don't want to play even the tiniest part

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.260
in grooming them to disregard

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.300
their natural protective instincts.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.940
Those instincts are there for a reason, to keep them safe.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.700
They need those instincts intact and sharp,

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.300
and that's why I won't use preferred pronouns.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.540
Using rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:52.340
Okay, so these are the thoughts

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.980
of someone who's been hurt.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.580
Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.020
that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.100
is intensely personal.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.100

I was born this way.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.140
Born as a fucking idiot.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:34.420
I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.980
It's kind of an Agatha drink.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.420
Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.900
That's the plot, pay attention, it makes sense.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.140
Also, a martini, what is a martini?

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.300
But an excuse to drink a glass of gin.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.220
Should probably eat an olive,

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:52.180
or this is gonna go straight to my fucking, my brain.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.740
Okay, we have to be serious now.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.060
In Turf Wars, Joanne writes,

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.700
I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years,

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.380
and I have never talked publicly

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.380
about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.180
On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.820
is proceeding with its controversial

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.180
gender recognition plans,

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.540
which will, in effect, mean that all a man needs to do

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.500
to become a woman is to say he's one.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.300
To use a very contemporary word, I was triggered,

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.980
ground down by the relentless attacks from trans activists

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.060
on social media.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.780
I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.340
inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.900
I suffered in my 20s recurred on a loop.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.540
I couldn't shut out those memories,

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.780
and I was finding it hard to contain my anger

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.940
and disappointment about the way I believe

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.260
my government is playing fast and loose

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.060
with women's and girls' safety.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.980
Okay, so for Joanne, her traumatic experience

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:52.020
being attacked by a man is psychologically related

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.940
to her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people,

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.860
and about trans people saying nasty things

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.180
about her on Twitter.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.860
She feels intensely about this issue

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.300
because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.580
In her own words,

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.940
The scars left by violence and sexual assault

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.260
don't disappear, no matter how loved you are,

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.540
and no matter how much money you've made.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.980
My perennial jumpiness is a family joke,

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.300
and even I know it's funny,

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.540
but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.340
for hating sudden loud noises or finding people behind me

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.140
when I haven't heard them approaching.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.740
A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance,

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.260
a constant alertness to danger.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.060
This is described in a very wise book

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.380
called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Schulman.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.980
The traumatized person's sense of their ability

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.500
to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.860
They feel endangered,

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.860
even if there is no actual danger in the present,

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.200
because in the past,

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.300
they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty,

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.860
and they know it is possible.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.020
I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.340
is a real experience of suffering

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.300
that is not the victim's fault,

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.820
even in cases where that response is irrational

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.580
or politically incorrect.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.060
For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager,

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.140
I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.260
around black teenagers for a while.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.060
However, if that jumpiness motivates you

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.460
to become a campaigner

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.660
for more militant policing of black neighborhoods,

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.180
then you are participating in anti-black racism,

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.460
and that I will criticize, regardless of your trauma.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.020
I hope it goes without saying

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.340
that trans people gaining easier access

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.640
to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.780
is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.900
being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.340
This is a non sequitur.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.740
So it's a little odd to me that,

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.460
while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.460
that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma,

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.460
and she's self-aware enough to realize

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.060
that her hypervigilance is often irrational

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.900
to the point where she herself finds humor in it,

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:08.540
she's somehow not self-aware enough to realize

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.020
that her fears about trans people

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.960
are an irrational manifestation of that hypervigilance.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.060
And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma,

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.820
and I would be nothing but sympathetic

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.660
if her feelings about this amounted

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.540
to simply being triggered by, for example,

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.340
perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom,

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.580
which is something most trans women are sensitive to.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.020
Like, I've spoken to trans women

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.480
who are worried they don't pass,

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.180
or who know they don't pass,

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.860
and who do everything they can

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.980
to avoid using a public bathroom

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.380
because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.980
So these trans women go through life every day

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.860
compromising their own comfort and safety

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.860
to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.740
But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.800
of an automatic trigger response.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.020
It's become a fixation for years,

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.460
to the point where she's written a 900-page novel

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.700
about a serial killer who cross-dresses

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.300
to trick women into being less vigilant.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.940
And now, the primary political cause

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:14.380
she's decided to use her superstardom to champion

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.780
is opposition to trans liberation.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:20.600
And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.580
Like, if you're against gay marriage

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.060
because you were traumatized as a child

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.780
when your father left your mother for a man,

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.540
you're still a homophobe, right?

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.020
You're not less of a bigot

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.340
because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.420
In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.820
Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked,

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.860
so it's often rooted in trauma.

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.900
After the collective trauma of 9-11,

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.260
Americans felt threatened, not just by al-Qaeda,

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.540
but by the entire religion of Islam.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.340
And this was used, and is still being used,

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.700
to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.540
Feelings of victimization are often used

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.860
as a justification for aggression.

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.160
And when the target of that aggression

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.400
is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.400
Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.680
who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.920
Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy,

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.280
creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.680
TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.240
It's biological women who are the real victims.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.040
The real victim.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.240
So often in debates on social issues,

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.480
we're faced with two opposing sides,

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.360
both claiming to be the victim,

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.920
and we're often told to believe victims,

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.000
believe marginalized people.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.560
Well if only it was that easy.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.480
So often, the exact point in question

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.280
is who is the victim, and who's the oppressor?

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.840
That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse,

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.500
describes the way the overstatement of harm

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.080
is used as a justification for cruelty

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.880
in situations ranging from romantic relationships

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.520
to international affairs.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.880
Bullies often conceptualize themselves

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.480
as being under attack

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.760
when they are the ones originating the pain.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.040
Throughout Joanne's essay,

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.280
she frequently represents herself

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.240
as taking a defiant, free-speechy stand against.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.480
Accusations and threats from trans activists.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.880
The trans activists who declare that TERFs

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.720
need punching and reeducating.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.000
Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.760
by the trans activists.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.680
And in her subsequent tweets,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.960
she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.120
Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.800
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.240
This is the new Salem?

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.640
Women are being attacked online

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.240
for taking a stand against the transsexuals?

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.760
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.240
Let's see what else we have for sale

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.720
at wildwomenworkshop.com.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.280
Fuck your pronouns.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.920
Trans men are my sisters.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.760
Sorry about your dick, bro.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.480
That's a good one, I'd wear that.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.920
Don't call me sis.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.480
Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.640
Must be really hard for you.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.840
Not being a tr-

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.400
War is peace.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.240
Freedom is slavery.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.320
Ignorance is strength.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.600
Trans women are women.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
Got the sense of persecution.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.160
This is Orwell's nightmare?

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.240
This is how Nazi Germany started?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.280
First Hitler told the transgenders

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.680
they're a super-hecking valid uwu,

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.160
then he burned their books out.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.480
Wait, oh, no.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.240
That's actually the opposite of what happened.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.240
Slurs, feminist t-shirt.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.200
Nice trilby, it's very dapper.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.200
Slurs, man-hater, feminazi, prude, witch, bigot.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.080
Wait, bigot?

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.200
Are we reclaiming bigot now?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.200
Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.200
Joanne wrote in her essay

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.600
that she was standing up in solidarity

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.880
with women who have histories like mine

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.440
who've been slurred as bigots

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.440
for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.280
Slurred as bigots.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.200
There's something so revealing about the claim

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.160
that bigot is a slur,

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.360
because so much of indirect bigotry

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.360
is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.840
Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.480
It's good, it's very clever.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.600
A white racist will hardly ever use

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.480
the phrase white supremacy.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.520
No, they say white genocide, always on the defensive.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.240
And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.440
The same conservative media,

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.800
who 10 years ago were portraying lesbians

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.880
as like angry mannish dicks,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.880
have now created this mythology of lesbians

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.560
as these virginal damsels in distress

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.680
who are threatened with invasion,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.880
and now extinction.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.800
On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.520
who are somehow coercing them into becoming men,

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.200
Elliot, no, you can't possibly be doing this

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.440
because you're 33 years old

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.200
and capable of autonomous thought.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.720
Clearly, you are tricked

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.720
by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.480
And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told,

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.920
are slurring as bigots.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.000
Lesbians who won't sleep with them.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.160
Joanne claims that,

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.400
none of the gender critical women I've talked to

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.720
hates trans people.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.520
On the contrary, many of them become interested

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.080
in this issue in the first place

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.000
out of concern for trans youth,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.400
and they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.440
who simply want to live their lives.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:38.080
But the only gender critical women she mentions by name

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.800
are Maya Forstater, who I would not describe

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.960
as hugely sympathetic to trans adults,

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.880
and Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says,

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.360
Magdalene was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.000
Magdalene was a great believer

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.360
in the importance of biological sex

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.040
and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.920
for not dating trans women with penises.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.640
Okay, so I agree it would be awful to call someone a bigot

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:09.960
just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis,

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.240
but are you sure that's why people

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.360
call Magdalene Burns a bigot?

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.560
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.080
about trans women that might lead people

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.840
to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.200
You are fucking blackface actors.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.320
You aren't women, you're men who get sexual kicks

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.160
from being treated like women.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.880
Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.520
Our oppression isn't a fetish, you pathetic, sick fuck.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.280
Hugely sympathetic, hugely sympathetic.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.160
Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.040
to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots,

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.360
and because she constantly frames herself

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.880
as the victim of terrifying trans activists

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.120
who say mean things online,

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.080
I think it's fair for me to mention that this right here

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.660
is how I'm used to being spoken to

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.440
and spoken about by TERFs.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.360
When you're a trans woman online,

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.120
TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.360
They deadname and misgender you, they mock your genitals,

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.560
they describe your surgery results

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.840
as necrotic mutilated wounds,

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.740
they interpret your every feeling and experience

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.160
as the manifestation of a sick woman-hating fetish.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.880
You know, in an unrelated video last year,

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.880
I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man,

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.200
and I've since been told by TERFs,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.200
essentially, trans-identified males get sexual kicks

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.040
from being treated like women.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.800
Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.200
Hugely sympathetic.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.320
I hope I don't even need to say that the idea

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.040
that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.480
is a violently anti-feminist thought,

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.120
and it's a thought that could only be believed,

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.800
and believed in the name of feminism, no less,

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.840
by people who have spent days and weeks

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.820
absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.400
that TERF forums exist to promote.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.400
Now I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.480
with me right now, she'd say,

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.800
"'I'm so sorry you've been treated that way,

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.140
"'but I too have been cruelly victimized online

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.080
"'by the trans activists.'"

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.040
And you know what?

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.520
I'm sure that's true.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.240
When I listen to Joanne talk

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.320
about being victimized by trans Twitter,

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.120
it's easy for me to sympathize,

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.760
because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.040
The vilification, the obsession,

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.880
the fantasies of violence.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.400
It's a pretty common occurrence

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.040
for me to look up my mentions

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.640
and see people with trans flag avatars

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.120
posting things like,

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.960
"'Point of view, you are truescum

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.680
"'and Yoshi is gonna beat you to death with a golf club.'"

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.680
Hashtag yes all gamers.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.000
Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-semite

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.540
because three years ago I made a joke

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.200
about reptilian overlords,

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.360
and then they get mad because I said

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.400
I wanted to understand non-binary people

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.760
instead of just dogmatically believing things,

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.960
and they conclude,

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.560
"'So basically, fuck ContraPoints,

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.280
"'I wanna bash her over the goddamn head

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.040
"'with a metal bat over and over again.'"

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.240
So this is the level of antipathy

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.480
that I attract from trans Twitter.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.720
So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.520
by abusive messages,

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.280
I'm inclined to believe her.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.320
I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.880
with anime avatars saying things like,

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.560
"'J.K. Rowling is hypocritical trash

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.000
"'who literally waltz millions of trans kids dead.'"

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.960
"'Harry Potter was always neoliberal,

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.220
"'garbage, and we should have seen this coming.'"

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.460
"'This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy,

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.240
"'she deserves a backhand slap to the face.'"

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.020
And tweets like that are abusive.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.380
It's not okay, and I don't make any excuses for it.

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.920
I wanna make a dark and stormy.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.280
Sorry, I'll be right back.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.240
Hey, I'm back.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.080
It's good.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.120
So I also think that there really is

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.480
an element of misogyny to them.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.780
I had to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:15.780
You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.800
while holding a tropical drink.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.040
It's just not possible to do with a straight face.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.200
So I agree, there really is an element of misogyny to this.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.720
Misogyny is the most universal prejudice,

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.840
and trans people are not immune.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women,

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.320
regardless of whether their anger is justified.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.160
There is a witch hunt impulse

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160
that's still alive in our culture.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.280
To be a famous woman is to constantly have

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.320
every part of your body and soul

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.680
subject to endless critique.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.280
You know, if you're one pound overweight,

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.480
they call you a fatty.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.960
If you're one pound underweight,

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.880
they say you have an eating disorder.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.880
And if you're exactly the right weight,

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.720
they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.640
You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.040
There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.420
When you're a famous woman,

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.520
it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters,

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.720
because the haters bring the obsession to you.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.920
But it's important to remember

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.080
that haters are not the same as bigots.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.760
Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry,

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.760
unless it's tied to a history of oppression

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.680
or a backlash against a movement of equality.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.440
So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.040
And no, David Silverman, the word racist

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.800
is not like the N-word.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.240
And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.920
Turf is not a slur.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.360
And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.680
but it's not a form of oppression.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.600
And I say this as someone, at this point,

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.560
most known for complaining about cancel culture.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.220
Oh god, is this my legacy?

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.560
A lot of trans people have been very mean,

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.280
verbally abusive even, to JK Rowling.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.480
But most people criticizing Joanne,

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.960
or criticizing me for that matter,

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.320
might be hurt and angry, but they're not violent.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.200
But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:12.000
of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.360
you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.560
crashing over you all at once.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:22.860
And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent,

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.640
they become emblematic of the way

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.560
the whole experience feels.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.600
And if you've been the victim of abuse before,

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.160
the experience can be pretty triggering.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.760
So it's just not always as simple as the victim,

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.360
and the abuser.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.080
Sometimes victims are also abusers.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.520
Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.480
Sometimes righteously angry people

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.280
cross a line into abusive excess.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.640
And not all abuse comes from a position of power.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.720
Why are so many trans people on Twitter

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.800
so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.880
Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.720
that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.520
as it does to TERFs.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.600
People living in unrecovered trauma

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.600
often behave in very similar ways

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.280
to the people who traumatize them.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.640
Over and over, I have seen traumatized people

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.400
refuse to hear or engage information

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.280
that would alter their self-concepts,

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.680
even in ways that could bring them

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.540
more happiness and integrity.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.160
The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.740
is rooted in a panic that their fragile self

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.460
cannot bear interrogation,

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.380
that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.220
Perhaps because supremacy in some

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:39.900
produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.860
And of course, many perpetrators

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.260
were or are victims themselves.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.860
A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.500
and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.820
at trans people, a vulnerable group

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.300
who they can mostly get away with hurting.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.500
Unlike standing up to powerful men, right,

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.100
which would be dangerous and difficult.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.100
And a lot of trans people have been

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.260
very horribly treated by men, by TERFs,

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.480
by strangers on the street, by their own families.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.500
And for some of those trans people,

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.740
canceling celebrities on Twitter

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.340
is the one kind of power they have.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:19.820
Plus, a lot of extremely online trans people

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.780
really don't have a strong sense of conviction

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.940
in their own identity, which is why they need

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.260
constant external validation to prop them up.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.500
They need to constantly be told that they're valid,

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.020
that they really are the gender that they say they are.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.820
And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:41.520
their fragile self-concept, they lash out,

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.540
Twitter being their only weapon.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.260
You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.180
that all you're asking, all you want,

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.020
is empathy and understanding.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.820
And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.540
But trans people also deserve more empathy

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.500
and understanding than you've given them.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.340
Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.460
that are always raging against you

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.140
and raging against me, for that matter.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.620
In between the raging, look at what they're doing.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.140
They're begging, begging for money to pay for healthcare,

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.300
begging for money to pay for housing.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.540
You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:24.540
or pounds, or gringotts, or whatever you people have.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.140
And trans people are out here

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.860
literally begging for healthcare.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.580
They're begging, Joanne.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.980
How powerful could the trans agenda really be?

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:37.300
Joanne, you have so much power and influence,

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:40.380
many, many times more than what I have.

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.900
And I have much more power and influence

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.700
than most trans people.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.900
You know, I am in a very different situation

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.140
than most trans people.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.040
I have a lot of other things going for me in this world,

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.660
but a lot of them have nothing.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.140
They have nothing, Joanne.

01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.260
And I just, I think you should take that into consideration

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.620
next time you decide to speak out

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.280
about how trans activists are oppressing you.

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:07.980
Get it together, Gorge.

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.220
Are you listening to yourself?

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:10.420
What are you doing, Joanne?

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.900
You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.940
being rejected and humiliated and excluded

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.580
over and over again.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.300
So they're traumatized, they're easily triggered

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.100
by anything that reminds them of past betrayal

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.260
and abandonment, which is something

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.420
I think you could empathize with.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.020
Joanne, you are famous for writing a book

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.580
about a neglected and abused boy who lives in a closet

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.180
until he's whisked away to a magical world

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:37.860
where he and his freaky friends

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.620
find acceptance in each other.

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.860
I remember when I first met you all.

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.260
Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.700
We're still a bunch of misfits.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:49.420
Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.280
So many trans people have found comfort in this story

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.580
and an escape from a world that doesn't offer

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.660
a lot of comfort to trans people.

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:01.660
So for you to use your fame and influence

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:05.980
to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.820
it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.980
And I don't blame them for feeling that way.

01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.460
I feel it too.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.460
So, Joanne.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.820
Jo.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.060
Mother.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.580
I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.500
I know how much that sucks,

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.580
so if you ever wanna take me up on it,

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.660
I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.860
But otherwise, I think we're done here.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.180
As a trans person, I like to believe

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.180
in the power of human metamorphosis.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.780
But I realize that at this point,

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.740
you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.940
and constantly trashed by trans people,

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940
so it would be pretty difficult

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.620
to change tracks at this point.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.660
You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off,

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.300
and I don't know, Joanne, maybe you are one in a million.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.860
I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban,

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.580
and that shit got me through fifth grade,

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:54.580
so who knows, maybe you have another miracle in you.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.780
But I'm too old to believe in magic now,

01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.540
so I'm not gonna sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:02.940
Okay.

01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.980
I guess that's it.

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.940
Mischief managed.

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.620
["The Prisoner of Azkaban"]
