1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,720
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,620
Something wicked this way comes.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,000
Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Magical darkness.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,340
A must.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,760
Joanne, I wanna talk to you, Joanne.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,400
What is it about Joannes?

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,480
I can't catch a break from these people.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,000
So, now that 2020 is finally over,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,040
I think we can let the record conclusively show

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,300
that it was a year whomst is bad.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,480
And on top of everything else that was going on,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,080
truly the last thing we needed

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,040
was the author of Harry Potter coming forward to announce

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,400
there's two things she can't stand,

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,680
bigotry and the transgenders.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,800
Ow.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Elderberry wand, turgid, with a core of,

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880
ice dragon, lumos.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,120
Can we afford spells?

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,040
Is that in the budget?

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,080
Expecto Patreon.

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,360
So, you've probably heard by now

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,120
about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,820
Unless you've been living under a rock,

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,640
in which case, get back under that rock, sweetie.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
There is nothing good going on up here.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,560
It's not worth it.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,320
Or maybe you heard that all Joanne did

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,680
was say biological sex is real,

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,400
and now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,040
are trying to silence her.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,080
This is cancel culture gone too far.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
This is a witch hunt.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Celebrities are under attack.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
This is the new Salem.

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,040
This is Orwell's nightmare.

39
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,160
This is a painful topic for me all around

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,720
because as a transgender woman,

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,840
I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Joanne has said in the last year.

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
But I also know what it's like

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,400
to be the target of a Twitter mob.

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,540
And I realize that to most people,

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,680
complaining about being canceled,

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,720
it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed.

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,200
Like you'd especially think that rich and famous people

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,920
like J.K. Rowling would be above

50
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,440
staying up alone at night

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,440
reading mean things people say online.

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,000
But you'd think wrong.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness

54
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
of the human condition,

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,760
and no amount of fame and money is gonna fix that.

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
You know, fame alienates you from other people.

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,920
It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses,

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,680
which can actually make you feel more alone,

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,560
even when people are worshiping you as a goddess.

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
Nevermind how it feels when they're hunting you as a witch.

61
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,080
The truth is that unless you've personally experienced

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
infamy, being shamed and shunned

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,560
on a scale the human brain can't really even understand,

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,400
then you just don't know what it's like.

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,320
And you don't know how you'd react in that situation.

66
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
But Joanne knows,

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,700
and when I see her getting trashed on the TL,

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,260
there's a traumatized part of me

69
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,800
that's unironically triggered by watching people cancel her.

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
And I wanna protect

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
my nurturing and compassionate nature

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,960
sometimes gets the best of me.

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,360
But there's also a part of me that wants

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,600
to join the trashing.

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,720
How could you do this to me, Joanne?

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
I did not come out of the cupboard

77
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,480
under the stairs for this.

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,960
So what I wanna do in this video

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,240
is take Joanne's pain seriously

80
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
and treat her like a complex human being,

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,960
while also being critical of the things she said

82
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,600
about the transgender question.

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,080
And I also wanna explore where the Twitter mob

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,160
is coming from,

85
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,280
because they're in pain too,

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,120
and don't they also deserve our understanding?

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
So without further ado,

88
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,240
let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush

89
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
and see if we can find the truth.

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,700
Swish and flick.

91
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
♪♪♪

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:54,160
So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot?

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,840
Well, she certainly seems invested

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,120
in the belief that she's not a bigot.

95
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,560
What vice do you most despise?

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Bigotry.

97
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,240
And looking over Joanne's tweets,

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,800
I don't think the average person

99
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,360
would see any problem with what she's said.

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,160
However, I mean, not to be condescending,

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,040
but I feel like the average person's understanding

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,760
of transgender is still a little bit,

103
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,600
I don't really get the whole trans thing.

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Like, why can't you just be a feminine man?

105
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,560
I don't know, Amber, why don't you be a feminine man?

106
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,440
Who knows, you could be missing out.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
So we're gonna go through the things

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
that Joanne has said about trans people,

109
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,880
but I don't want this to be just a drama video

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,640
or a video saying cancel Harry Potter, drag her.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
I wanna try to do something

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
a little bit more meaningful than that.

113
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
So I'm gonna use JK Rowe as a case study in bigotry

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
and see if we can maybe learn something

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,600
about what bigotry is.

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,820
How does it work?

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,040
And how do otherwise good people get drawn into it?

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,640
And if we can make any progress on any of those questions,

119
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,440
well, for once I think I'll actually

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,760
have earned my Patreon budget.

121
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,420
So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,

122
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,280
let's spill some shade, throw some tea.

123
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,100
So this all started in 2018

124
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,660
when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet

125
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,980
and followed an anti-trans account.

126
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,300
Now in the interest of giving Joanne

127
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,380
as much benefit of the doubt as I can,

128
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,100
I'm not gonna admit this as evidence

129
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,740
because I don't wanna do guilt by association.

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,800
Strike it from the record.

131
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,700
That was fun, I like hammering things.

132
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,220
The real story begins in December 2019

133
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,340
when Joanne tweeted the hashtag I stand with Maya

134
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
referencing Maya Forstater.

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,220
Maya Forstater is an English consultant

136
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,020
who lost her contract with the nonprofit she worked for

137
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,620
after she did transphobic tweets.

138
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,460
And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us

139
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,140
in her thread titled Allegedly Transphobic Tweets.

140
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.

141
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,480
Yes, I think that male people are not women.

142
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,460
I don't think that being a woman or female

143
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,140
is a matter of identity or womanly feelings.

144
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,300
It is biology.

145
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
Another says.

146
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,860
Some people believe that a person

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,500
with a penis can be a woman.

148
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,860
Some, a majority, don't.

149
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,740
Neither group should be discriminated against

150
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,820
in everyday life, but in situations

151
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,160
involving taking your clothes off for strangers,

152
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,620
integration of the two groups is not possible.

153
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,580
And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged,

154
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,000
burgeoning trans woman flashing her penis at cis women

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,740
and saying, it's all right, it's a woman's penis.

156
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,860
So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.

157
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,780
Everyone born female is a woman,

158
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,500
everyone born male is a man,

159
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,700
trans women are predators who prey on women,

160
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,900
and I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.

161
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,380
Is this what you want, Joanne?

162
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,160
You wanna put the sorting hat on humanity

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,020
and divide us up into little houses?

164
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,140
Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor

165
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,060
trapped in a Hufflepuff's body?

166
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,420
What then, Joanne?

167
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,360
What then?

168
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,140
Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya?

169
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,780
Well, if the tweet simply said,

170
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,940
I stand with Maya without further explanation,

171
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,860
you could give her the benefit of the doubt.

172
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,180
Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job

173
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,020
for having bigoted opinions,

174
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,980
even if she disagrees with those opinions.

175
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,020
But if that's all she was saying,

176
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,340
I wouldn't be making this video, would I?

177
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,740
The full tweet reads,

178
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,200
Dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like.

179
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,140
Sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

180
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,300
Live your best life in peace and security.

181
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,540
But force women out of their jobs

182
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,500
for stating that sex is real?

183
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,660
Hashtag I stand with Maya, hashtag this is not a drill.

184
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,860
Now I'm guessing that to most people,

185
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,220
this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.

186
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,480
It might even seem supportive of trans people,

187
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,700
since she said we're allowed to dress however we want

188
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,100
and call ourselves whatever crazy thing.

189
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,300
But there's a couple things about this

190
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700
that don't sit right with me.

191
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,140
First is the phrase,

192
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,740
force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

193
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,040
Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary

194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,820
of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint,

195
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
namely,

196
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,060
I believe that it is impossible to change your sex

197
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,380
or to lose your sex.

198
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,180
Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men.

199
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,220
No change of clothes or hairstyle, no plastic surgery,

200
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,860
no accident or illness, no course of hormones,

201
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,020
no force of will or social conditioning, no declaration

202
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,980
can turn a female person into a male

203
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,860
or a male person into a female.

204
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,980
If Joanne had said Maya had been fired

205
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,460
for claiming that a person born male could never be a woman

206
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,500
and a person born female could never be a man,

207
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,260
that would've been more accurate,

208
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,340
but it would also sound contentious,

209
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,220
and obviously anti-trans.

210
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,540
Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present

211
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,180
Maya Forstater's transphobia as a simple statement of fact,

212
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,740
basic common sense,

213
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,460
which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.

214
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,980
Transphobes love to play this game

215
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,220
where they pretend that trans people

216
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,500
just don't understand basic biology, that's our problem.

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,580
As if I didn't start taking female hormones

218
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,380
because I'm acutely aware

219
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,140
that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body,

220
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,740
that sex is real.

221
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,940
You will never be a woman, Nathan.

222
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,300
Every cell in your body is male and has a Y chromosome.

223
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,380
Really?

224
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
That's crazy.

225
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,140
How'd you learn so much about science?

226
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,380
You know, I don't really feel the need

227
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,940
to have a second X chromosome.

228
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,220
I get by with one.

229
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
I make it work.

230
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,900
I actually like the Y chromosome.

231
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,020
I think it's a little more dainty, you know?

232
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,100
It's a little softer, a little more petite.

233
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages,

234
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
don't you think?

235
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,060
And I don't need any more of those, thanks.

236
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,900
No trans person thinks it's possible

237
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,660
to change chromosomal sex,

238
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,540
and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.

239
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,500
When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,

240
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,260
we're talking about psychological and social identity.

241
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,020
So when transphobes say sex is real,

242
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,540
they're not actually contradicting

243
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,580
anything most trans people believe, except by implication.

244
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,820
When transphobes say sex is real,

245
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,220
what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.

246
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,380
They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,

247
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,380
which they trivialize, calling it dressing up,

248
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,060
fashion choices, whatever you wanna call yourself.

249
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,380
When Joanne says, dress however you please,

250
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,620
call yourself whatever you like,

251
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,580
she's belittling what it actually means to be trans,

252
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,020
reducing it to a change of name and costume.

253
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,620
It's similar to the language of casual homophobes.

254
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,780
For example, the homophobic equivalent

255
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,380
of Joanne's tweet might read,

256
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,940
Choose whatever lifestyle you want.

257
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,500
Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult

258
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,620
in the privacy of your own bedroom.

259
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,940
But force Christians out of their jobs

260
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,140
for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?

261
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,780
Hashtag I stand with Kim Davis.

262
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,380
A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.

263
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,980
Checkmate the gays, it's just science.

264
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,740
Homophobes trivialize what it is to be gay.

265
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,540
They refer to it as sexual preferences,

266
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,700
or a lifestyle, or what you do in the bedroom.

267
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,620
We don't tell straight people

268
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,260
to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom, but we should.

269
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,660
Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.

270
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,260
Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.

271
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,740
It's also who you love.

272
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,500
It's part of who you are, part of your humanity,

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,540
and that's something that stays with you

274
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,920
outside of the bedroom.

275
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,460
So to dismiss it as sexual preferences is homophobic.

276
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,380
Likewise, being trans is not a costume

277
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,940
I take off at the end of the night.

278
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,020
It's not a fashion choice.

279
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,260
It's not a pet name some people call me.

280
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,120
It's part of who I am as a person, you know?

281
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,900
It's part of my humanity,

282
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,580
and it's also the kind of body I have, a transsexual body.

283
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,620
So telling trans people to dress however you want

284
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,420
is not really a supportive statement,

285
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,060
unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton socks

286
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,540
in their videos apologizing for being racist,

287
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,900
which is not valid, and is in fact a hate crime.

288
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,720
YouTubers are constantly dragging each other

289
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,880
because we see ourselves reflected in the other,

290
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,700
and we can't stand the sight of it.

291
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,540
So after the Maya Forrester tweet,

292
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,740
Joanne was silent about trans people for six months,

293
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,460
but she took up the cause again in June 2019,

294
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
first to complain about the use of the phrase

295
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,780
people who menstruate in the title of an article

296
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,620
trying to include trans men and non-binary people

297
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
in a discussion of period poverty.

298
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,140
That same night, presumably in response

299
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,020
to her Twitter mentions being lit up by leftist teenagers

300
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,620
who think Stalin did nothing wrong

301
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,420
but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,

302
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,660
Joanne tweeted a thread,

303
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,900
again repeating the slogan that sex is real, adding,

304
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,060
it isn't hate to speak the truth,

305
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,460
and concluding with another backhanded statement of support.

306
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,340
I respect every trans person's right to live any way

307
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,020
that feels authentic and comfortable to them.

308
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,580
I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

309
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,380
on the basis of being trans.

310
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,980
If you were discriminated against

311
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,300
on the basis of being trans?

312
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,220
If?

313
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,460
Widespread discrimination against trans people

314
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,820
is well-documented.

315
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,340
In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet,

316
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,100
the Trump administration removed

317
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,280
non-discrimination protections for trans people

318
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,260
in healthcare and health insurance.

319
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,060
So are you marching with us or not, Joanne?

320
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,540
There's a lot of stuff in these tweets

321
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,340
that might seem innocent enough to the average person,

322
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,660
but which to someone who understands

323
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,340
bigotry against trans people raises a red flag.

324
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,220
Bigotry always has a history,

325
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,300
and in order to understand bigotry,

326
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,020
you have to learn that history.

327
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,340
Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes,

328
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,260
narratives, arguments, which we aren't born knowing,

329
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,760
we have to learn them.

330
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,020
No one is born thinking that the gays

331
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,260
are destroying the family,

332
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,420
or that women are naturally subservient,

333
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,700
or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.

334
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,220
So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices,

335
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,700
you might not notice anything wrong with them.

336
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,660
He never said he hated the Jews,

337
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,100
he is simply concerned about the over-representation

338
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,440
of Jewish people in media and banking.

339
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,280
But if you're aware, woke, if you will,

340
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,020
then it kind of rings alarm bells

341
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,260
when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.

342
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,540
When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people

343
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,020
think sex isn't real,

344
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,300
and they're erasing same-sex attraction,

345
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,100
and they're silencing women,

346
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,820
alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these

347
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,300
familiar transphobic talking points,

348
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,940
specifically TERF talking points.

349
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,100
TERF means trans-exclusionary radical feminism.

350
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,780
God, are we still talking about this?

351
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,820
I promise, this is the last time.

352
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,020
So TERFism is a, it's a hate movement

353
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,660
that disguises transphobia as feminism.

354
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,400
Bigotry has a history.

355
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,120
The foundational TERF text is feminist professor

356
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,500
Janice Raymond's 1979 book,

357
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,420
The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the Sh-tty Male,

358
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
in which Raymond argues that, quote,

359
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,960
All transsexuals rape women's bodies

360
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,000
by reducing the real female form to an artifact,

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
appropriating this body for themselves.

362
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,620
She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy

363
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,460
who, quote, merely cut off the most obvious means

364
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,780
of invading women.

365
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,180
This book's at the general tone for feminist transphobia,

366
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,380
and I bring this up because I wanna give you a sense

367
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,940
of how this kind of transphobe talks

368
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,540
when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.

369
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,780
Typical male narcissist,

370
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,340
Nathan manipulates his cultish audience

371
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,700
into thinking he's the victim of the big ol' meanie TERFs.

372
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,740
If you keep calling me Nathan,

373
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm gonna call you Nigel.

374
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,100
Cheerio, old chap, or whatever you people say.

375
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Here's the thing, Nigella.

376
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,420
Bigotry can be mean, yes,

377
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,500
and it usually is when bigots think

378
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
they can get away with it.

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,380
But it's vital to recognize that being mean

380
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,460
is not the essence of bigotry.

381
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,660
Bigotry can be hateful, yes,

382
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,020
but specifically, bigotry is hate

383
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,900
that poses a political threat to the target group.

384
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,220
The fundamental problem with TERFs

385
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,940
is not that they're mean,

386
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,380
it's that they're politically reactionary.

387
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,340
They wanna reverse the progress of trans liberation.

388
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,940
In the final chapter of The Transsexual Empire,

389
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,860
Raymond lays out her solution to the trans question.

390
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,700
Quote,

391
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,620
The problem of transsexualism would be best served

392
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,020
by morally mandating it out of existence.

393
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,500
I believe that the elimination of transsexualism

394
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,060
is not best achieved by legislation

395
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,220
prohibiting transsexual treatment and surgery,

396
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,960
but rather by legislation that limits it.

397
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,900
I would favor restricting the number of hospitals

398
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,020
and centers where transsexual surgery could be performed.

399
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,060
The kind of counseling to pass successfully

400
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,900
as masculine or feminine

401
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,580
that now reigns in gender identity clinics

402
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,380
only reinforces the problem of transsexualism.

403
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,420
She goes on to argue

404
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,180
for alternative feminist consciousness-raising therapies,

405
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,020
admitting,

406
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,620
I am not so naive as to think

407
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,720
that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight,

408
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,580
but they would at least pose the existence

409
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,740
of a real alternative to be explored and tried.

410
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,300
So like homophobes,

411
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,460
TERFs have historically advocated

412
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,620
a kind of conversion therapy

413
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,060
aimed at eliminating transsexual identity and behavior.

414
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,980
And like the anti-abortion movement,

415
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,080
they recognize it's not yet politically practical

416
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,740
to completely make illegal a medical procedure

417
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,920
they don't like,

418
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,980
so they settle for making it as difficult

419
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,740
as possible to get one.

420
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,460
In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report

421
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,480
to the Department of Health and Human Services

422
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,980
repeating her arguments against transsexualism,

423
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,340
which was cited in a 1981 decision

424
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,020
that Medicare would not cover

425
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,700
transition-related healthcare.

426
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,060
That decision wasn't overturned until 2014.

427
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,660
So there's real political consequences to bigotry.

428
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,940
It's not just a matter of being mean.

429
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.

430
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,460
Unlike Janice Raymond,

431
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,040
J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced

432
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,580
and very intent on convincing all of us

433
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,960
that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally

434
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,420
who loves and supports trans people,

435
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,260
while in the same breath spewing transphobic arguments.

436
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
She's constantly saying things like,

437
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,380
I know and love trans people,

438
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,100
but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

439
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,740
on the basis of being trans.

440
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,420
At the same time,

441
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,460
none of the gender-critical women I've talked to

442
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,140
hates trans people.

443
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,180
On the contrary,

444
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,060
many of them became interested in this issue

445
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,380
in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

446
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,280
A lot of people have a hard time noticing

447
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,620
this kind of bigotry,

448
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,460
and I think one reason for that

449
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,880
is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.

450
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,980
People think of bigotry as like judging a group

451
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,540
instead of an individual,

452
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,380
which is of course a horrible thing to do.

453
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,060
I don't care for the English.

454
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,420
There's sick, sick people.

455
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,020
Or people think of bigotry as hate,

456
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,140
something inhuman and monstrous.

457
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,180
So when people hear the word bigot,

458
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,700
they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,

459
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,660
some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.

460
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,180
But the problem with the Nazis

461
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,100
was not that they hated love and friendship.

462
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,760
They believed they were defending German blood and soil

463
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,860
against Marxist Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.

464
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,740
And what were we supposed to do?

465
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,580
Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?

466
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,740
That's how a Nazi actually thinks, right?

467
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,820
It's not that they hate friendship.

468
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,940
No, they have their own internal logic

469
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,460
of victimization and self-righteousness.

470
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,420
So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,

471
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,340
you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.

472
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,060
You know, sometimes people criticize me

473
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,140
for empathizing with bigots,

474
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,300
but I believe that understanding bigots

475
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,080
is the best defense against becoming one yourself.

476
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,180
Because when you dehumanize the villains,

477
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,260
you become unable to recognize the villain within.

478
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
How is she, though?

479
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,980
She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.

480
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,180
Metal straw because I love the environment.

481
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,540
I'm so good, I'm really fucking good.

482
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,980
The idea that bigotry is simply hate

483
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,740
I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.

484
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,900
It's the idea that bigots are people who outright say,

485
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,540
we hate you, God hates you,

486
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,380
and we're all marching around with signs

487
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,900
about how much we hate you,

488
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,940
like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.

489
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,860
Taylor Swift.

490
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,100
Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.

491
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,780
Well, I don't.

492
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,100
I don't want to be a gay icon,

493
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,620
I'm just stuck with you people.

494
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,460
Just kidding.

495
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,140
Shade never made anybody less gay.

496
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,940
This isn't Shade, Taylor.

497
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,620
Shade is J.K. Rowling telling trans people,

498
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,500
sleep with any consenting adult who will have you.

499
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,520
Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.

500
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,820
And the video for You Need to Calm Down

501
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,700
is just so emblematic of this misconception.

502
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,340
Taylor takes the subject of homophobia

503
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,740
and turns it into yet another song about haters.

504
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,060
But in the real world,

505
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,100
backwoods hillbillies stomping around

506
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,020
with misspelled signs are not really the problem.

507
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,140
The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated

508
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,700
and powerful people.

509
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,940
And yeah, there are still blatant homophobes

510
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,620
who say it's an abomination,

511
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,300
these perverts are spreading AIDS,

512
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,580
they're destroying the family,

513
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,940
they're recruiting children.

514
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,940
But these days it's much more common to hear,

515
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,300
of course I love gay people,

516
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,660
some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction.

517
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,740
But it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology

518
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,560
promoted in schools to children as young as three years old.

519
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,220
Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.

520
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm a good convincing homophobe, don't I?

521
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,460
There's really two different styles of bigotry.

522
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,300
They express the same prejudice,

523
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,020
but they're very different in tone.

524
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,540
I'll call the two styles direct bigotry

525
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,940
and indirect bigotry.

526
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,340
Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.

527
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,700
It's a bigotry manifested in slurs

528
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,220
and outright discrimination

529
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,100
and demonizing the target group

530
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,860
and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.

531
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,780
Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern

532
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,020
or debate about a host of proxy issues.

533
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,540
It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.

534
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,340
Frequently the claim is that a once-needed

535
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,860
liberation movement has now gone too far,

536
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,780
but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors

537
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
who are disturbing law and order

538
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,220
with violent and chaotic protests,

539
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,780
who are victimizing and silencing innocent people

540
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,060
by calling them bigots,

541
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,580
who are infiltrating the media

542
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,820
and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment

543
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,020
with politically correct propaganda.

544
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,880
And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated

545
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,140
to speak out against it

546
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,340
because cancel culture is out of control

547
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,500
and free speech is under attack.

548
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,260
The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,

549
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,140
ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders,

550
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,220
rapists, brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.

551
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,940
Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,

552
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,900
always a knight in shining armor,

553
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,220
defending women, defending the children,

554
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,420
defending marriage, defending freedom,

555
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,180
defending the family, defending our values,

556
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,660
defending common sense, defending tradition,

557
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,040
defending civilization itself,

558
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,300
defending God.

559
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,640
He's all powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.

560
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,960
I think a lot of people

561
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,840
take a borderline heroic view of themselves,

562
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,440
and indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.

563
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,240
Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets

564
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
with some big abstract concept.

565
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,440
Instead of Jewish people,

566
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,720
they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.

567
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,880
Instead of women, they claim to hate feminazis,

568
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,340
or the friend zone.

569
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,920
Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.

570
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Trans people become transgenderism,

571
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,320
gender ideology, transactivists.

572
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,040
What they're really against is equality,

573
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
but they don't say that.

574
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,960
In fact, they may not even think it.

575
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,740
But they tell on themselves

576
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,320
when they react with instinctive hostility

577
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,600
to anyone who agitates for change.

578
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,480
It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter thugs

579
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,360
shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.

580
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,840
A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices

581
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,120
by Elizabeth Young-Bruhl really helped me with this video.

582
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,520
One of the points she makes

583
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
is that a lot of the time, bigotry is backlash.

584
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,600
Ideologies of desire are, generally,

585
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,720
backlashes against movements of equality.

586
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,920
They are regressive prejudices

587
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,280
that reinstate inequalities and distinctions

588
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,840
when the force of movements for equality has been registered

589
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,000
and, often unconsciously, rejected.

590
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

591
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,680
Bigotry is not just the psychological state

592
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,720
of hating a group of people.

593
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,560
Bigotry is political.

594
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,040
It's a reaction to changing demographics

595
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,840
or to liberation movements

596
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,760
or to changing power relations between groups.

597
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,400
A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women

598
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
in the literal psychological sense.

599
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,480
It's more that they feel threatened

600
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,520
by the prospect of the social

601
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,560
and political equality of women.

602
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,760
In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened

603
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,120
is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry,

604
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,680
much more so than feeling hateful.

605
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,000
So bigotry is reactive,

606
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,720
and it changes along with the circumstances

607
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,160
it's a reaction to.

608
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,600
1950s misogyny still has some things in common

609
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
with 2020s misogyny.

610
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,880
For example, a lot of men still feel some need

611
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,080
to control women's sexuality and women's bodies,

612
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,800
but it's also changed a lot as gender relations

613
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,360
have shifted in the last 70 years.

614
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,300
The idea that women are naturally suited

615
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,800
to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent

616
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,760
than it used to be.

617
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,160
And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder,

618
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,840
because in the last decade,

619
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,000
trans liberation has increased our visibility.

620
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,920
People are running into us at work now.

621
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
They're having to use our pronouns.

622
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,580
They're seeing us in politics or in media,

623
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,140
and not just as laughingstocks or monsters

624
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,740
like we used to be, but as actual characters.

625
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,380
And a lot of people are not very happy about it.

626
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,780
They feel threatened.

627
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,940
That must be super fucking hard for you.

628
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,980
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

629
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,700
So J.K. Rowling frames her position as,

630
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,260
I am just saying the fact that sex is real.

631
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,780
It's not hateful to say a fact.

632
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,140
Why is everyone so mad at me?

633
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,500
A fact can't be bigoted.

634
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,620
And I agree that a fact cannot be bigoted,

635
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,780
but a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.

636
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,980
Usually when we discuss facts,

637
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,900
we're using those facts to tell a story.

638
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,140
And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.

639
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,120
You know, suppose someone tweets the fact

640
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,820
that the homicide rate is higher

641
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,420
for black Americans than white Americans.

642
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,540
I'm gonna ask, what story are you trying

643
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,340
to tell with this fact?

644
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,620
What political goal are you trying to support?

645
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,980
One way indirect bigotry works

646
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,100
is by camouflaging political struggles

647
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,940
as intellectual debates.

648
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,660
When Joanne says sex is real,

649
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,460
she sounds like she's staking out a position

650
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,420
in the trans debate, which is then presented

651
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,420
as an intellectual conflict

652
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,460
about the metaphysics of gender,

653
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,940
instead of what it really is,

654
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,020
which is a political conflict

655
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,660
about the social equality of transgender people.

656
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,020
And the effectiveness of that strategy

657
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,380
is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan

658
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,460
of the slogan trans women are women.

659
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,920
And this is just my opinion,

660
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,940
I don't speak for any other trans people,

661
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,020
but there's a couple things I don't like about it.

662
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,260
One is trans men and non-binary people matter

663
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,900
just as much as trans women.

664
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,060
Which you don't as often hear,

665
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,060
trans men are men, or non-binary people are...

666
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,620
valid?

667
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,820
Doesn't really work, does it?

668
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,220
The other problem with trans women are women

669
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,300
is it tends to invite the response,

670
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,460
well, what does it even mean to be a woman?

671
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,940
Define womanhood.

672
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,660
And now you're immediately getting baited

673
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,860
into some bullshit semantic debate

674
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,460
about what is a real woman.

675
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,580
A real woman.

676
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,500
How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?

677
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,180
What if you're in the Matrix right now,

678
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,860
and in the real world, you're biologically male?

679
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,620
The tables are turned.

680
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,820
It doesn't really matter, does it?

681
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,440
This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.

682
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,900
You know, I've been down this road too many times already,

683
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,940
and I always end up having these dead-end conversations

684
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,420
about gender performativity,

685
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,580
or worse, conversations about what it means

686
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,940
to feel like a woman.

687
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,260
Well, the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.

688
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,700
I don't think anyone feels like a woman, honestly,

689
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,780
except a certain sub-genre of gay men,

690
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,580
and possibly Shania Twain.

691
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,700
Probably not even her anymore, honestly.

692
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,500
Not since the early 2000s.

693
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,900
You know, some questions should be dissolved

694
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,180
rather than solved.

695
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,580
That's what Wittgenstein said.

696
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,580
That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.

697
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,740
Sometimes the only way to answer a question

698
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,740
is to realize you're asking the wrong question.

699
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,980
How do I know I'm a woman?

700
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,820
Well, look at me.

701
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,020
Oh, I rest my case.

702
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,780
The monitor's over here.

703
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,900
That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.

704
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,780
I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.

705
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,060
Look, trans people can't even agree among ourselves

706
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
what gender is.

707
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,380
In fact, if you even try to answer the question,

708
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,660
you end up enraging some part of the community

709
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,100
who feels excluded.

710
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,460
So no, trans people are not trying

711
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,620
to force an ideology on people.

712
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,460
We don't even share an ideology within our own community.

713
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,620
What we share are a common set of political struggles

714
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,740
against discrimination, against harassment,

715
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,700
against excessive medical gatekeeping,

716
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,140
against exclusion from public life.

717
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,500
So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women?

718
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,780
Well, ideally, something that includes all trans people

719
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,500
and something that evades pointless philosophizing

720
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,260
about biology and what is gender and who is true trans

721
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,060
and what is a woman really.

722
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,460
Something that centers what actually matters,

723
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,260
which is freeing trans people

724
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,180
from the stigma and discrimination

725
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,940
that have historically prevented us

726
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,060
from becoming equal members of society.

727
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,420
So I know it sounds kind of outdated, very 1970s,

728
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,860
but I personally like the slogan trans liberation now.

729
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,540
It's short, it's sweet,

730
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,340
and instead of prompting define women at it,

731
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,620
it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation?

732
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,300
Liberation from what?

733
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,980
And then you can say, well, I'll tell you.

734
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,180
And now you're talking about politics

735
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,100
instead of talking about semantics.

736
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,460
Isn't that better?

737
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,860
I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed

738
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,460
with reassuring ourselves that we are valid

739
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,820
that we sometimes forget that the end goal

740
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,300
of a political movement is not validity, it's equality.

741
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,400
That's what we're supposed to be fighting for.

742
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,060
So instead of asking, does J.K. Rowling think we're valid,

743
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,980
which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid?

744
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,580
Well, maybe I care a little bit.

745
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,500
But instead, why don't we ask,

746
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,660
is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality?

747
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,180
Doesn't that just bring reality back into focus?

748
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,460
Isn't it so much better

749
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,300
to have a concrete political project in front of you

750
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,180
instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology?

751
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,140
Trans people are a population of people

752
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,740
who have a right to equality

753
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,580
and to freedom from discrimination.

754
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,060
We are not an ideology that's up for debate.

755
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,860
But that's how J.K. Rowling frames the trans question.

756
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,780
Not as a struggle for equality that she opposes,

757
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,300
but as an ideology that she disagrees with.

758
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,660
I'm just saying that sex is real.

759
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,700
Is that all you're saying, Joanne?

760
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,200
♪♪♪

761
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,460
Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire

762
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,020
in the prefect's bathroom?

763
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,740
Moaning Myrtle, hey, how are you?

764
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,060
I wonder if that inspired my love of baths.

765
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,700
This bath is actually really nice.

766
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,660
It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil,

767
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,980
Epsom salts, just kind of everything

768
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,900
that's good in baths all together.

769
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,460
I don't wanna talk about bigotry.

770
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,140
I wanna talk about baths.

771
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,620
Can this just be a video about baths from now on?

772
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,140
Oh, fine, I'll do my job.

773
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,580
On June 10, J.K. Rowling published an essay to her website,

774
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,100
which on Twitter she titled Turf Wars,

775
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,740
which was just awarded the Russell Prize by the BBC

776
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,420
for its brave display of unyielding transphobia, I guess.

777
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,900
The essay is several pages long

778
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,340
and outlines her reasons for speaking out

779
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,300
on sex and gender issues.

780
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
I refuse to bow down to a movement

781
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,700
that I believe is doing demonstrable harm

782
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,620
in seeking to erode women as a political

783
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,940
and biological class and offering to cover predators

784
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,260
like few before it.

785
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,820
Where do I even begin with this one?

786
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,740
Well, let's pick some highlights.

787
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,540
Woman is not a costume.

788
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,900
Woman is not an idea in a man's head.

789
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,220
Woman is not a pink brain.

790
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,940
My liking for Jimmy Choo's

791
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,660
or any of the other sexist ideas

792
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,700
now somehow touted as progressive.

793
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,900
Oh, well, my mistake.

794
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,020
Here I was, thinking I was a woman.

795
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,380
It turns out I'm just a man who likes expensive shoes.

796
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,340
What a whimsical misunderstanding.

797
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,220
Okay, well, that's it, everyone.

798
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,260
The channel's over.

799
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,860
Thanks for the likes and comments.

800
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,940
I'm gonna head out now to the Jimmy Choo store

801
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,020
and I guess I'll cut my tits off.

802
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,740
Joanne, Joanne, this is madness, Joanne.

803
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,940
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms

804
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,460
and changing rooms to any man who believes

805
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,660
or feels he's a woman, and as I've said,

806
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,540
gender confirmation certificates may now be granted

807
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,420
without any need for surgery or hormones,

808
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,740
then you open the door to any and all men

809
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,660
who wish to come inside.

810
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,980
So look, I understand that some women are anxious

811
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,140
about the thought of predators in bathrooms.

812
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,660
And believe me, I don't wanna share a bathroom

813
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,460
with a predator any more than you do.

814
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,020
Why are all my rose petals on this one side?

815
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,580
Some of them need to come over here.

816
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,540
Come here.

817
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,260
I've redistributed the petals.

818
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,500
Socialist icon.

819
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,260
But this talking point that gender change

820
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,300
on legal documents will enable predators

821
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,120
to enter bathrooms, it doesn't really make sense

822
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,020
because gender policing in public bathrooms

823
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,260
doesn't involve legal documents.

824
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,180
When was the last time you had to present

825
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,560
a gender certificate to gain admittance

826
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,900
to a public bathroom?

827
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,980
This feels like a strangely outdated conversation

828
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,260
to be having during pandemic lockdown.

829
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
Imagine using a public bathroom.

830
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,880
Imagine being in public.

831
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,380
I've been reading this book called Female Masculinity,

832
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,580
which is about the experiences of butch women.

833
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,340
And there's a section here called The Bathroom Problem,

834
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,100
which describes how women's bathrooms

835
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,340
tend to operate as an area for the enforcement

836
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,980
of gender conformity.

837
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,660
The author, Jack Halberstam, who's assigned female

838
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,540
at birth and presents masculine,

839
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,420
describes routinely having security called on him

840
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,220
for using the women's bathroom.

841
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,340
Having one's gender challenged in the women's restroom

842
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,500
is a frequent occurrence in the lives

843
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,100
of many androgynous or masculine women.

844
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,300
Indeed, it is so frequent that one wonders

845
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,860
whether the category woman,

846
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,200
when used to designate public functions,

847
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,020
is completely outmoded.

848
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,800
Queer literature is littered with references

849
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,720
to the bathroom problem,

850
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,200
and it would not be an exaggeration to call it

851
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,040
a standard feature of the butch narrative.

852
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,160
And that's very interesting to me

853
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,680
because as a feminine trans woman,

854
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
I have not once been questioned

855
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,240
or had the authorities called on me

856
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,080
in a women's public bathroom

857
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
in the entire time I've been using them,

858
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,880
which is several years now.

859
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,620
So when Joanne Ruling, a feminine heterosexual woman,

860
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,680
calls for more bathroom policing

861
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,480
to protect the lesbians or whatever,

862
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
it just seems ignorant

863
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,520
of the way bathroom policing actually works.

864
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,720
Like, is she just so famous

865
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore

866
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,480
and she forgot how they work?

867
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,640
How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?

868
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,820
$10?

869
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,680
Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,

870
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,280
not chromosomes, and there's no practical way

871
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,480
to change that short of stationing a genital inspector

872
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,000
in every stall, you know,

873
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,640
just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.

874
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,360
That's a very good idea, Joanne.

875
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,240
That's very good.

876
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,880
Ironically, radical feminists aren't even trans-exclusionary.

877
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,360
They include trans men in their feminism

878
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,520
because they were born women.

879
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,780
Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists

880
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,720
think that trans men are women?

881
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,640
Hello, operator, could you get me Alanis Morissette?

882
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,720
I have a new incident to report.

883
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,080
So look, I could keep refuting points made in Turf Wars,

884
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,400
which is basically just a series

885
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
of common transphobic canards

886
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,640
we've all heard a hundred times before,

887
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,520
but I want to focus in particular on some passages

888
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,920
that I think are very revealing

889
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,080
about the psychology of transphobia.

890
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,240
What is it about the transgenders

891
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,520
that some people feel threatened by?

892
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,160
Well, Joanne Rowling gives us a lot to work with

893
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,600
in answering that question.

894
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
You know, Joanne being a TERF

895
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
is mostly terrible for trans people,

896
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,060
but maybe the silver lining

897
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,420
is that the most famous novelist in the world

898
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,000
having a public transphobic breakdown

899
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,420
is providing a wealth of insight

900
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,000
about the interior world of a transphobe.

901
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,220
In Turf Wars, Joanne claims her interest

902
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,060
in the trans issue is intensely personal,

903
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,020
and she has two reasons why it's personal.

904
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,500
The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,

905
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
she would have been transed.

906
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,380
Someone would have transed her.

907
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,220
You know, people are being transed left and right these days.

908
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,140
It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.

909
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,100
Trans people, we're always on the lookout

910
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,140
for the next person we can trans.

911
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,860
That's all we wanna do, is trans people.

912
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,020
I transed four people this morning before I ate breakfast.

913
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,940
She thinks that she would have been recruited

914
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,920
by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones

915
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,380
by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.

916
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,060
And in support of this speculation,

917
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,300
Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes

918
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,220
about social contagion, and to quote,

919
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,700
4,400% increase in girls being referred

920
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,220
for transitioning treatment.

921
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,060
And that sounds pretty alarming, right?

922
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,820
4,400%.

923
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,500
But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,

924
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,420
only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred.

925
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,200
And by last year, that number was 1,740,

926
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,580
with the biggest increase happening five years ago.

927
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,260
You know, the transgender tipping point year.

928
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,700
So that is a big increase, but it corresponds

929
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,420
to the biggest ever increase in trans visibility.

930
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
So it does make sense,

931
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,860
and there's 11 million children in the UK,

932
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,940
so let's say 5.5 million girls,

933
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,940
and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.

934
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,540
And considering that around 1% of adults

935
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,660
are some kind of transgender, 0.03% of kids

936
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,420
is not really an alarming number to me.

937
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,900
If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.

938
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,020
But part of Joanne's problem here

939
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,340
is that she seems not to really understand

940
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,060
what being trans is.

941
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,540
The writings of young trans men reveal a group

942
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,620
of notably sensitive and clever people.

943
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,080
The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,

944
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,940
with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,

945
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,620
dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm, and self-hatred,

946
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,300
the more I've wondered whether

947
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,660
if I'd been born 30 years later,

948
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,820
I too might have tried to transition.

949
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,020
The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.

950
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,740
If I had found community and sympathy online

951
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,220
that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,

952
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,100
I believe I could have been persuaded

953
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,500
to turn myself into the son my father

954
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,060
had openly said he'd have preferred.

955
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,180
Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness

956
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,460
and my ambivalence about being a woman

957
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,180
reflected in the work of female writers and musicians

958
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,880
who reassured me that in spite of everything,

959
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,500
a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.

960
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,020
It's fine not to feel pink, frilly,

961
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,880
and compliant inside your own head.

962
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,580
It's okay to feel confused, dark,

963
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,060
both sexual and non-sexual,

964
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,380
unsure of what or who you are.

965
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,180
Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here,

966
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,820
and let's start by making a list

967
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,340
of things being a transgender man is not.

968
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,420
Having anxiety, having dissociation,

969
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,500
having an eating disorder, doing self-harm,

970
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,760
doing self-hatred, a viable way

971
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,260
to make your sexist father proud,

972
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,300
not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,

973
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,060
not being compliant, feeling confused,

974
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,140
feeling dark, feeling sexual,

975
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,660
feeling non-sexual, feeling unsure of who you are.

976
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,020
Okay, so you can be a trans man

977
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,260
and experience some or even all of these things,

978
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,460
but none of these things are what being a trans man is.

979
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,900
Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body

980
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,540
and literally live your life as a man

981
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,820
is not the same as the typical struggles

982
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,060
other girls go through.

983
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,140
Joanne is projecting her own memories

984
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,620
of troubled adolescence onto trans men,

985
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,980
and then saying, oh, clearly they were going

986
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,340
through the same things I was,

987
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,980
just someone persuaded them to transition.

988
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,900
It's a limitation of human empathy

989
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,660
that sometimes when we're trying to understand

990
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,420
what someone else is feeling,

991
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,660
the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them,

992
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,220
and sometimes that's a misrepresentation.

993
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,740
Sometimes other people are experiencing things

994
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,900
that we have never experienced.

995
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,220
So we have to invent explanations

996
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,740
about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.

997
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,580
Someone is persuading them to transition.

998
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,420
But this fear-mongering about kids

999
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,580
being persuaded to transition is just not how things work.

1000
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,220
From the way transphobes talk about it,

1001
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,380
you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground

1002
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,560
picks up a toy truck, an endocrinologist pops out

1003
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,160
from behind a tree and says,

1004
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,560
we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.

1005
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,520
Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.

1006
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,240
But this is the narrative that transphobes are pushing,

1007
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,240
in particular about young transmasculine people.

1008
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out

1009
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,640
that is essentially to transmasculine people

1010
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,360
what the transsexual empire was to trans women.

1011
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,960
It's called Irreversible Damage,

1012
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,760
The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.

1013
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,320
Chapter one.

1014
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,600
A contagion.

1015
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,480
Jesus.

1016
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,020
Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?

1017
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,640
The argument is that female-to-male transgenderism

1018
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,880
is an infectious social disease,

1019
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,520
which is literally the argument

1020
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,420
Hitler made about homosexuality, but okay, great.

1021
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,600
I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues

1022
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,520
is that not enough attention is paid

1023
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,200
to transphobia against trans men.

1024
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,220
Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,

1025
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,120
Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,

1026
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,040
transgender women are women,

1027
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,540
and that's very nice of him,

1028
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,080
but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.

1029
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,160
In fact, she spends more words on trans men

1030
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,640
than on any other topic,

1031
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,600
so I think it's worth looking in particular at that.

1032
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,340
Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men

1033
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,440
is not the same as transphobia against trans women.

1034
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,780
There's a lot of similarities,

1035
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,160
but they're really two different prejudices,

1036
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,600
and they come from different psychological places,

1037
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,280
in the same way that lesbophobia

1038
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,720
is different from homophobia against gay men.

1039
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,160
For trans women, I would say

1040
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,520
the distinctive experience of transphobia

1041
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,840
is being simultaneously treated

1042
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,020
as a pornographic female fetish object

1043
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,040
and as a dangerous male predator.

1044
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,400
The ultimate sex demon, this kind of incubus succubus

1045
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,720
who will ravage your wife and trap your husband.

1046
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,960
Your polygamous commune will be devastated.

1047
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,760
Whereas I feel like transmasculine people

1048
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,920
are less vilified, but so infantilized.

1049
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,520
I guess transphobes view trans men as women,

1050
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,840
a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply,

1051
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,040
so much for transitioning to escape sexism.

1052
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,520
The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls

1053
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,480
can't possibly decide for themselves

1054
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,200
what to do with their own bodies,

1055
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,560
so the courts must intervene to take control,

1056
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,960
which is exactly what just happened in the UK,

1057
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,080
where trans youth under 16 will now need

1058
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,040
not only the approval of a doctor,

1059
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,680
but will need to seek a court order

1060
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,480
in order to get puberty blockers.

1061
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,280
And the justification given for this

1062
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,600
mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns

1063
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,760
about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls

1064
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,240
being unable to make informed decisions.

1065
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,920
In her essay, Joanne says,

1066
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,200
I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman

1067
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,920
who's older than I am and wonderful.

1068
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
Although she's open about her past as a gay man,

1069
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
I've always found it hard to think of her

1070
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,960
as anything other than a woman.

1071
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,880
Being older, though, she went through

1072
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,120
a long and rigorous process of evaluation,

1073
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,000
psychotherapy, and staged transformation.

1074
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,160
The current explosion of trans activism

1075
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems

1076
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,720
through which candidates for sex reassignment

1077
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
were once required to pass.

1078
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,560
So that's what she wants.

1079
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,320
She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,

1080
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,720
which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,

1081
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,280
just Joanne's more polite about it.

1082
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,440
I want to make a drink.

1083
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,480
Oh, fuck.

1084
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,600
Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.

1085
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,280
No, just drank a lot.

1086
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,240
Ugh, we're revealing leg again.

1087
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,120
The scandal.

1088
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,840
Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it

1089
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,360
is that much more chaste.

1090
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,480
Well, I'm an extremely chaste woman.

1091
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,800
I try to honor God with my body.

1092
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,760
That's why I got a sex change.

1093
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,680
I'm honoring God with my sex change.

1094
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,880
I'm not drunk enough for this.

1095
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,920
So I also want to point out that cis men and cis women

1096
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,600
are often transphobic for different reasons.

1097
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,560
A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women

1098
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,120
because the thought that a man can become a woman

1099
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,800
threatens the certainty of their own manhood.

1100
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,720
It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men

1101
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,920
are homophobic.

1102
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,320
They feel their own masculinity is threatened by it.

1103
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,520
And of course, a lot of straight men

1104
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
are attracted to trans women,

1105
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,280
and they feel that that attraction threatens

1106
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,440
their identity as straight men.

1107
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,320
Back in my comp hat days when I dated men,

1108
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,680
for a couple straight guys I hooked up with,

1109
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,040
going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.

1110
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,440
This is it, Mr. Frodo.

1111
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,960
If I take one more step,

1112
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,720
I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.

1113
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,800
Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.

1114
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,720
And afterwards, they go into this whole Cartesian spiral.

1115
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,080
What have I done?

1116
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,400
What does this mean?

1117
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,320
Who am I?

1118
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,220
I think for a lot of cis women,

1119
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,840
the very existence of trans men

1120
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,440
sends them into a similar identity crisis.

1121
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,880
I think a lot of women have had to fight

1122
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,000
a really difficult internal battle

1123
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,960
to make peace with their own womanhood.

1124
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,860
And for some women, confronting the existence

1125
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,480
of transgender people seems to open some old wounds.

1126
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,000
Like I've noticed in particular

1127
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,160
that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs

1128
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,480
are older lesbian women on the more butch side of things.

1129
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,880
And these women see hyperfeminine trans women

1130
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,120
in makeup and dresses, and they say,

1131
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,880
that is not what being a woman is.

1132
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,640
I've had to fight for my own identity

1133
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,040
against the idea that that's what being a woman is.

1134
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,300
These are just misogynistic stereotypes.

1135
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,560
You are a parody of womanhood.

1136
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,760
You're a fetishist.

1137
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,180
And when they see trans men, they say,

1138
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,320
you're a traitor.

1139
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,720
You're a self-loather.

1140
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,200
Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman

1141
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,760
the way I've had to?

1142
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,120
But this is all projection and misunderstanding.

1143
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,960
Trans women do not think that wearing dresses

1144
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,540
is what makes us women.

1145
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,640
And trans men do not think that not feeling pink,

1146
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,760
frilly, and compliant is what makes them men.

1147
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,480
These are meanings that J.K. Rowling is assigning

1148
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,120
to trans people's actions in her own brain,

1149
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,920
because she perceives our lives

1150
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,440
as some kind of commentary on gender,

1151
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,400
with an implied ideology about what it means

1152
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,920
to be a man or a woman.

1153
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,180
But that's your interpretation, Joanne.

1154
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,180
That's a meaning that you are imposing on us,

1155
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,660
because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage

1156
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,740
of your own, and it's interfering with your ability

1157
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,340
to genuinely empathize with trans people.

1158
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,700
You know, at the end of your essay,

1159
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,820
you say that you never forget the inner complexity

1160
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,440
when it comes to trans people.

1161
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
And that's a nice thought,

1162
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,540
but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people

1163
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,140
as some kind of abstract theory of gender,

1164
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,140
or as a projection of your own adolescence,

1165
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,860
then you're not really seeing us as distinct individuals

1166
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,260
with our own experiences and stories.

1167
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,660
And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson

1168
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,500
on trans people, sorry, gender issues,

1169
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,060
I think it would be good if you listened

1170
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,820
to the experiences of trans men without, for instance,

1171
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,060
superimposing your own troubled relationship

1172
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,140
with your father.

1173
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,060
I should probably talk about the book,

1174
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,220
since I did go to the trouble to read all 900 pages,

1175
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,260
because unlike certain other YouTubers,

1176
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,300
I do in fact know how to read.

1177
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,220
Troubled Blood was published in September 2020

1178
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,540
by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith.

1179
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,460
You know, for someone apparently so concerned

1180
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,900
about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,

1181
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,580
the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is,

1182
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,740
it's interesting.

1183
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,320
It's a choice.

1184
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,580
God, this thing is huge.

1185
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,660
It's like the infinite jest of terfory.

1186
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,380
So Troubled Blood is a detective novel

1187
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,340
about the simmering heterosexual tension

1188
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,140
between two investigators.

1189
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,420
And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?

1190
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,540
Simmering.

1191
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,100
There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe,

1192
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,660
and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1213
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,940
So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,

1214
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,180
a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman

1215
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,180
to lull his victims, whom he abducts,

1216
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,980
tortures, rapes, and murders.

1217
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Interesting.

1218
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,780
Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,

1219
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,340
I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.

1220
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,100
But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,

1221
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,260
have called this book transphobic.

1222
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,460
And you might think that's unfair

1223
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:29,140
since the character Dennis Creed, this serial killer,

1224
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,020
is a, he's not a trans, he's a cross-dresser.

1225
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,060
This has nothing to do with trans people.

1226
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,300
Why so triggered, snowflake?

1227
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,500
Well, precious, there's a couple things

1228
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,940
I think are worth taking into consideration here.

1229
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,900
One is that the transvestite or transsexual serial killer

1230
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,660
is an old transphobic trope.

1231
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,180
It's a cliche that goes back decades.

1232
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,780
And I take great offense to the suggestion

1233
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,900
that trans women are serial killers

1234
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,780
because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.

1235
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,300
The trope seems to originate in 1960

1236
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,260
with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

1237
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,460
That's just my guess, though, I haven't researched this.

1238
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,100
Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?

1239
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,140
So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.

1240
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,700
The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up

1241
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,180
where the psychiatrist offers

1242
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,260
the pseudo-Freudian explanation

1243
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,940
that Norman Cross-dresses because the personality

1244
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,700
of his dead mother takes over

1245
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,940
and out of jealousy, kills the women

1246
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,500
Norman is attracted to.

1247
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,140
Therefore, the psychiatrist explains,

1248
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,140
Norman is not a real transvestite.

1249
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,340
You're a fake transvestite, Norman.

1250
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,620
Trender alert.

1251
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,980
But I do think that even if Psycho

1252
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,660
isn't explicitly transphobic,

1253
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,380
movies can subconsciously implant ideas

1254
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,940
and feelings into our brains.

1255
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,740
And I do think it's worth noting

1256
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,060
that the most famous and most terrifying

1257
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,980
murder scene in cinema history

1258
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,980
is of a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.

1259
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,060
To quote a popular film critic,

1260
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,260
you might not have noticed it, but your brain did.

1261
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,940
The cross-dressing psychotrope

1262
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,780
became explicitly transphobic

1263
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,500
in the campy 1980s Psycho ripoff Dressed to Kill,

1264
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,620
in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist

1265
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,060
who, yes, dresses as a woman

1266
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,980
to kill women he's attracted to.

1267
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,420
He was a transsexual.

1268
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,260
What?

1269
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,300
A transsexual.

1270
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,940
You see, there's some men and women, too,

1271
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,420
think they're born in the wrong body.

1272
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,060
They're called transsexuals.

1273
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,660
And all they want to do is have their sex changed.

1274
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,980
It's all they want to do, the transsexuals.

1275
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,380
Dressed to Kill also ends with the psychiatric summing up,

1276
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,500
where the doctor explains that Michael Caine

1277
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,660
is a case of opposite sexes

1278
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,180
inhabiting the same body.

1279
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,980
But it's the female Michael Caine who kills,

1280
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,620
because, and I quote,

1281
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,460
Elliot's penis became erect,

1282
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,820
and Bobby took control,

1283
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,060
trying to kill anyone that made Elliot masculinely sexual.

1284
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,580
There's often a misogynistic trope

1285
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,460
hiding behind the transphobic one.

1286
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,780
It's the woman in the man who does the murders.

1287
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,180
It's the mother's fault.

1288
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,300
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.

1289
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,540
The most mature iteration of this trope,

1290
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,700
the crown jewel of transphobic movies,

1291
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,260
is, of course, The Silence of the Lambs,

1292
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,060
which is honestly one of my favorite movies,

1293
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,180
because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins

1294
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,180
are just radiant in it.

1295
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,060
And also, I hate myself.

1296
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,740
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Buffalo Bill,

1297
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,980
an animal lover and innovative seamstress.

1298
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,260
Buffalo Bill is a trans-trender.

1299
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,460
A trans-trender!

1300
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,900
Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin,

1301
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,460
because his application for sex reassignment was rejected.

1302
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,380
Because, according to Hannibal Lecter,

1303
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,940
Billy is not a real transsexual.

1304
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,980
Hannibal Lecter is a truscum!

1305
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,060
There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,

1306
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,980
I just want to use this opportunity

1307
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,740
to reassure my trans audience

1308
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,980
that even if you've only killed one or two people,

1309
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,900
you're valid.

1310
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,780
I entertain myself.

1311
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,340
That's how I continue to struggle onwards.

1312
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,260
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

1313
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,660
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

1314
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,820
But his pathology is a thousand times more savage

1315
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,180
and more terrifying.

1316
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,060
More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?

1317
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,620
Is that even possible?

1318
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,340
Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here,

1319
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,460
because the sun is rising.

1320
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,020
Silence of the Lambs differs

1321
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,780
from its male gaze-y predecessors

1322
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,140
in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.

1323
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,380
Clarice is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,

1324
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,860
and every man in this movie is a pig,

1325
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,220
except maybe Hannibal Lecter,

1326
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,340
the only one who actually respects Clarice,

1327
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,580
the only real gentleman,

1328
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,940
with his Goldberg variations in his sketches of the Duomo.

1329
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,220
Chilton's a pig, the entomologist is a swine,

1330
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,020
even Crawford's kind of a pig.

1331
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,780
The pigs are pigs, Migs is pigs,

1332
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,540
and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

1333
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,380
Die Uberschwein, it's in the original German.

1334
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,700
The fuck am I talking about?

1335
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,900
What?

1336
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,140
And he's obsessed with death's head moths,

1337
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,100
this demonization of the most self-congratulatory metaphor

1338
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,940
for gender transformation.

1339
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,540
I can't believe I finally emerged

1340
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,260
as a beautiful butterfly.

1341
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,500
Show don't tell, Lily.

1342
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,900
Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people

1343
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,420
have so many rights that it's okay to make fun of us.

1344
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,620
There's a lot to work with.

1345
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,780
So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.

1346
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,860
I'm not saying it's inherently wrong

1347
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,540
to make a movie or write a book

1348
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,340
about a transgender serial killer,

1349
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,940
but there is an issue of representation.

1350
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,420
You know, for decades, there was close to zero

1351
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,660
good representation of trans people in movies or TV,

1352
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,020
but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers,

1353
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,780
and that has an effect on the way people think.

1354
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,540
When it comes time to debate bathroom bills,

1355
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,500
and people are subconsciously remembering Psycho,

1356
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,420
that has serious consequences for trans people.

1357
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,740
It's getting so bright in here,

1358
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,660
the sun has like, the sun has risen.

1359
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,260
And it's also not psychologically good for us

1360
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,980
to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures

1361
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,260
of ourselves in media.

1362
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,340
Like even as late as my early 20s,

1363
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,140
I didn't know any trans people,

1364
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,180
but I'd seen these transgender horror movies.

1365
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,500
I think the most positive approximation

1366
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,100
of representation I knew about

1367
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,860
was like Frank-N-Furter and Divine.

1368
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,580
And both of them are also psychotic murderers,

1369
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,300
just, you know, in a fun way.

1370
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,340
Shoulda just gotten her those cha-cha heels.

1371
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,380
So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans,

1372
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,020
but I guess I felt that it was basically

1373
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,140
the moral equivalent of being a serial killer.

1374
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,540
Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.

1375
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,700
And things have changed in the last 10 years.

1376
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,780
I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.

1377
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,300
There's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me

1378
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,700
who don't even hate themselves, can't relate.

1379
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,020
So this takes us back to 2020 and Troubled Blood.

1380
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,100
Joanne has written a book about a serial killer

1381
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,820
who dresses as a woman to kill women.

1382
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,960
Groundbreaking.

1383
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,220
Now this is such a cliche that you'd kind of expect

1384
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,860
a seasoned writer like JK Rowling to subvert it somehow.

1385
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,420
Give us a remix, turn it on its head.

1386
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,100
Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.

1387
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,580
You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.

1388
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,860
Or at least do something new with it.

1389
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,940
But she really doesn't.

1390
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,460
It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.

1391
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,380
I guess I should read you some passages.

1392
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,740
I'm reading it on my phone, I'm not bringing the book out

1393
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,700
and pretending to read on the book.

1394
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,980
You can see from my little bookmarks

1395
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,900
that I read the physical book.

1396
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,980
Yes, I'm a YouTuber, and yes, I read a book.

1397
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,580
So here's a psychiatrist.

1398
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,420
There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?

1399
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,220
Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.

1400
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,500
He's a classic sociopath, you see.

1401
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,460
A pure example of the type.

1402
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,100
He scores very highly on the dark triad.

1403
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,260
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

1404
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,980
Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.

1405
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,220
You see, he's what we in the medical profession call

1406
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,260
the baddie.

1407
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,420
Uh, quote Dennis.

1408
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,220
It excited me to watch a woman

1409
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,220
who didn't know she was being observed.

1410
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,500
I'd do it to my sisters.

1411
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,820
But I'd creep up to lit windows as well.

1412
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,940
If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing,

1413
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,220
adjusting themselves, or even a glimpse of nudity.

1414
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,340
I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects,

1415
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,580
but by the sense of power.

1416
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,140
I felt I stole something of their essence from them,

1417
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,140
taking that which they had thought private and hidden.

1418
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,660
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear

1419
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,020
from neighbors' washing lines,

1420
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,260
and even from his grandmother, Ina.

1421
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,580
These he enjoyed wearing in secret,

1422
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,220
and masturbating in.

1423
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,100
Remember when she wrote books about wizard school?

1424
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,300
Ho ho, dear readers.

1425
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,940
So Dennis Creed is characterized

1426
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,420
as a narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women.

1427
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,340
And like, okay, there really are men

1428
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,380
who fetishize women's clothes, for example.

1429
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,260
I mean, Freud talked about this, right?

1430
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,260
Partialism, where sexuality focuses on a body part

1431
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,940
or an article of clothing.

1432
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,580
And Freud theorized that fetishes emerge

1433
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,540
from the unconscious trauma that occurs

1434
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:51,420
when men discover that women don't have a penis.

1435
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,500
Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud.

1436
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,220
But considering that Joanne has been doing

1437
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,220
a lot of gender-critical reading over the past few years,

1438
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,820
it's kind of hard for me to ignore

1439
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,700
that narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women

1440
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,820
is exactly the way a lot of TERFs

1441
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,580
characterize trans women.

1442
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,140
Remember, the whole gender-critical feminists

1443
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,900
with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation.

1444
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,300
These people are bigots.

1445
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,420
And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs

1446
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,020
that trans women are hypersexual and hyperaggressive, right?

1447
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,660
These inherently pornographic sex demons.

1448
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,140
But can't we just have a reasonable debate about this?

1449
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,460
Are trans women sex demons?

1450
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,580
Why, yes.

1451
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,860
Yes, we are.

1452
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,900
The bigots are simply correct.

1453
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,900
We're sex demons.

1454
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,420
You can't even talk to these people.

1455
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,380
Like, how do you engage with this level of vilification?

1456
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,060
I used to take the bait and argue that,

1457
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,780
no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.

1458
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,180
Unless you want me to be.

1459
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,560
But it's counterproductive to make that argument.

1460
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Why?

1461
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,460
Because my not-involved-in-human-trafficking t-shirt

1462
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,500
has people asking a lot of questions

1463
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,260
already answered by my shirt.

1464
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,060
So I have a hard time believing

1465
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:12,300
that the character Dennis Creed has nothing to do

1466
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,740
with Joanne's beliefs about trans people.

1467
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,180
And I also want to note

1468
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,900
that Dennis's cross-dressing is described

1469
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,020
not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains

1470
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:25,660
from invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies,

1471
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,140
but also as a deliberate strategy of deception.

1472
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,980
Dennis says on page 854,

1473
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,100
so you know I actually read this fucking shit.

1474
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,100
In a wig, bit of lipstick.

1475
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,420
They think you're harmless, odd, maybe queer.

1476
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,060
You're the nice man who's safe.

1477
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,740
And earlier, he's described as,

1478
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,020
Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner,

1479
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,940
a genius of misdirection in his neat little white van.

1480
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:52,020
Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper

1481
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,180
and sometimes wearing a wig that,

1482
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,540
from a distance, to a drunk victim,

1483
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,220
gave his hazy form a feminine appearance just long enough

1484
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,780
for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.

1485
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,980
So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination,

1486
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,180
cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.

1487
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:13,980
They mistake him for a woman, or as, you know.

1488
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,060
And that causes them to lower their guard.

1489
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,020
And this reminds me of one of my aforestatter's

1490
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,660
allegedly transphobic tweets.

1491
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,300
Pronouns are a hypnom, important article by Harry Lactapi.

1492
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:30,300
A.K.A. Volfamort, she-who-must-not-be-named,

1493
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,100
followed by J.K. Rowling, because of course.

1494
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,620
Pronouns are rohypnol.

1495
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,940
Rohypnol is roofies.

1496
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,820
And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.

1497
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,660
Pronouns are like rohypnol.

1498
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,140
They dull your defenses.

1499
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,980
They change your inhibitions.

1500
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,820
They're meant to.

1501
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,100
You've had a lifetime's experience learning

1502
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,980
to be alert to him and to relax to her, for good reason.

1503
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,780
These instinctive responses keep you safe.

1504
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,740
It's not even a conscious thing.

1505
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,020
It's like the hairs standing on end.

1506
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,980
Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten

1507
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,300
by the saber-toothed tiger

1508
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,140
that your eyes haven't noticed yet.

1509
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,380
I want to be alert.

1510
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,980
I want others to be alert.

1511
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,180
I want people to see the real picture,

1512
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,460
and I want those instinctive reactions

1513
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,380
that we feel when something is wrong to be unblunted,

1514
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,140
undulled by this cheap but effective psychological trick.

1515
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,100
I feel like I owe this to myself,

1516
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,860
and I absolutely owe it to other women.

1517
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,940
And more than anything, I owe this to girls.

1518
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,260
I don't want to play even the tiniest part

1519
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,260
in grooming them to disregard

1520
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,300
their natural protective instincts.

1521
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,940
Those instincts are there for a reason, to keep them safe.

1522
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,700
They need those instincts intact and sharp,

1523
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,300
and that's why I won't use preferred pronouns.

1524
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,540
Using rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.

1525
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:52,340
Okay, so these are the thoughts

1526
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,980
of someone who's been hurt.

1527
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,580
Speaking of which, let's return now to the other reason

1528
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,020
that J.K. Rowling feels her interest in trans people

1529
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,100
is intensely personal.

1530
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:08,100

01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,420
I was born this way.

1535
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,140
Born as a fucking idiot.

1536
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,420
I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old.

1537
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,980
It's kind of an Agatha drink.

1538
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,420
Well, I'm a 200-year-old witch.

1539
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,900
That's the plot, pay attention, it makes sense.

1540
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,140
Also, a martini, what is a martini?

1541
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,300
But an excuse to drink a glass of gin.

1542
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,220
Should probably eat an olive,

1543
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:52,180
or this is gonna go straight to my fucking, my brain.

1544
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,740
Okay, we have to be serious now.

1545
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,060
In Turf Wars, Joanne writes,

1546
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,700
I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years,

1547
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,380
and I have never talked publicly

1548
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,380
about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.

1549
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,180
On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government

1550
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,820
is proceeding with its controversial

1551
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,180
gender recognition plans,

1552
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,540
which will, in effect, mean that all a man needs to do

1553
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,500
to become a woman is to say he's one.

1554
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,300
To use a very contemporary word, I was triggered,

1555
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,980
ground down by the relentless attacks from trans activists

1556
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,060
on social media.

1557
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,780
I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place

1558
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,340
inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault

1559
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,900
I suffered in my 20s recurred on a loop.

1560
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,540
I couldn't shut out those memories,

1561
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,780
and I was finding it hard to contain my anger

1562
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,940
and disappointment about the way I believe

1563
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,260
my government is playing fast and loose

1564
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,060
with women's and girls' safety.

1565
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,980
Okay, so for Joanne, her traumatic experience

1566
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,020
being attacked by a man is psychologically related

1567
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,940
to her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people,

1568
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,860
and about trans people saying nasty things

1569
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,180
about her on Twitter.

1570
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,860
She feels intensely about this issue

1571
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:07,300
because the discourse around it literally triggers her PTSD.

1572
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,580
In her own words,

1573
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,940
The scars left by violence and sexual assault

1574
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,260
don't disappear, no matter how loved you are,

1575
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,540
and no matter how much money you've made.

1576
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,980
My perennial jumpiness is a family joke,

1577
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,300
and even I know it's funny,

1578
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,540
but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do

1579
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:26,340
for hating sudden loud noises or finding people behind me

1580
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,140
when I haven't heard them approaching.

1581
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,740
A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance,

1582
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,260
a constant alertness to danger.

1583
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,060
This is described in a very wise book

1584
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,380
called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Schulman.

1585
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,980
The traumatized person's sense of their ability

1586
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,500
to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed.

1587
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,860
They feel endangered,

1588
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,860
even if there is no actual danger in the present,

1589
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,200
because in the past,

1590
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,300
they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty,

1591
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,860
and they know it is possible.

1592
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,020
I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response

1593
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,340
is a real experience of suffering

1594
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,300
that is not the victim's fault,

1595
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,820
even in cases where that response is irrational

1596
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,580
or politically incorrect.

1597
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:14,060
For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager,

1598
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,140
I wouldn't judge you if you felt a little jumpy

1599
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,260
around black teenagers for a while.

1600
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,060
However, if that jumpiness motivates you

1601
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,460
to become a campaigner

1602
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,660
for more militant policing of black neighborhoods,

1603
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,180
then you are participating in anti-black racism,

1604
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,460
and that I will criticize, regardless of your trauma.

1605
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,020
I hope it goes without saying

1606
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,340
that trans people gaining easier access

1607
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,640
to legal recognition in Scotland in 2020

1608
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,780
is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling

1609
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,900
being assaulted by a cis man in the 1990s.

1610
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,340
This is a non sequitur.

1611
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,740
So it's a little odd to me that,

1612
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:54,460
while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize

1613
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,460
that her hypervigilance is the result of trauma,

1614
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,460
and she's self-aware enough to realize

1615
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,060
that her hypervigilance is often irrational

1616
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,900
to the point where she herself finds humor in it,

1617
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,540
she's somehow not self-aware enough to realize

1618
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,020
that her fears about trans people

1619
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,960
are an irrational manifestation of that hypervigilance.

1620
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,060
And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma,

1621
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,820
and I would be nothing but sympathetic

1622
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,660
if her feelings about this amounted

1623
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,540
to simply being triggered by, for example,

1624
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,340
perceiving someone as male in the women's bathroom,

1625
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,580
which is something most trans women are sensitive to.

1626
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,020
Like, I've spoken to trans women

1627
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,480
who are worried they don't pass,

1628
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,180
or who know they don't pass,

1629
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,860
and who do everything they can

1630
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,980
to avoid using a public bathroom

1631
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:41,380
because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.

1632
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,980
So these trans women go through life every day

1633
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,860
compromising their own comfort and safety

1634
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:50,860
to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety.

1635
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,740
But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown the scope

1636
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,800
of an automatic trigger response.

1637
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,020
It's become a fixation for years,

1638
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,460
to the point where she's written a 900-page novel

1639
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,700
about a serial killer who cross-dresses

1640
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,300
to trick women into being less vigilant.

1641
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,940
And now, the primary political cause

1642
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,380
she's decided to use her superstardom to champion

1643
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,780
is opposition to trans liberation.

1644
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:20,600
And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.

1645
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,580
Like, if you're against gay marriage

1646
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,060
because you were traumatized as a child

1647
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,780
when your father left your mother for a man,

1648
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,540
you're still a homophobe, right?

1649
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,020
You're not less of a bigot

1650
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,340
because your bigotry has a tragic backstory.

1651
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:36,420
In fact, bigotry often has a tragic backstory.

1652
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,820
Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked,

1653
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,860
so it's often rooted in trauma.

1654
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,900
After the collective trauma of 9-11,

1655
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,260
Americans felt threatened, not just by al-Qaeda,

1656
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,540
but by the entire religion of Islam.

1657
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,340
And this was used, and is still being used,

1658
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,700
to justify wars, discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes.

1659
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,540
Feelings of victimization are often used

1660
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,860
as a justification for aggression.

1661
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,160
And when the target of that aggression

1662
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,400
is a marginalized group, the result is bigotry.

1663
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,400
Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists

1664
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,680
who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots.

1665
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,920
Trans women are men, they're agents of the patriarchy,

1666
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,280
creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces.

1667
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,680
TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to silence women.

1668
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,240
It's biological women who are the real victims.

1669
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,040
The real victim.

1670
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,240
So often in debates on social issues,

1671
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,480
we're faced with two opposing sides,

1672
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,360
both claiming to be the victim,

1673
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,920
and we're often told to believe victims,

1674
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,000
believe marginalized people.

1675
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,560
Well if only it was that easy.

1676
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,480
So often, the exact point in question

1677
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,280
is who is the victim, and who's the oppressor?

1678
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,840
That book I quoted earlier, Conflict Is Not Abuse,

1679
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,500
describes the way the overstatement of harm

1680
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,080
is used as a justification for cruelty

1681
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,880
in situations ranging from romantic relationships

1682
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,520
to international affairs.

1683
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,880
Bullies often conceptualize themselves

1684
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
as being under attack

1685
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,760
when they are the ones originating the pain.

1686
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,040
Throughout Joanne's essay,

1687
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,280
she frequently represents herself

1688
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,240
as taking a defiant, free-speechy stand against.

1689
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,480
Accusations and threats from trans activists.

1690
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,880
The trans activists who declare that TERFs

1691
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,720
need punching and reeducating.

1692
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,000
Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified

1693
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,760
by the trans activists.

1694
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,680
And in her subsequent tweets,

1695
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,960
she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.

1696
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,120
Sometimes a t-shirt just speaks to you.

1697
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,800
This witch doesn't burn.

1698
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,240
This is the new Salem?

1699
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,640
Women are being attacked online

1700
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,240
for taking a stand against the transsexuals?

1701
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,760
This witch doesn't burn.

1702
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,240
Let's see what else we have for sale

1703
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,720
at wildwomenworkshop.com.

1704
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,280
Fuck your pronouns.

1705
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,920
Trans men are my sisters.

1706
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,760
Sorry about your dick, bro.

1707
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,480
That's a good one, I'd wear that.

1708
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,920
Don't call me sis.

1709
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,480
Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.

1710
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,640
Must be really hard for you.

1711
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,840
Not being a tr-

1712
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,400
War is peace.

1713
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,240
Freedom is slavery.

1714
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,320
Ignorance is strength.

1715
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,600
Trans women are women.

1716
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,600
Got the sense of persecution.

1717
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,160
This is Orwell's nightmare?

1718
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,240
This is how Nazi Germany started?

1719
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,280
First Hitler told the transgenders

1720
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,680
they're a super-hecking valid uwu,

1721
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,160
then he burned their books out.

1722
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,480
Wait, oh, no.

1723
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,240
That's actually the opposite of what happened.

1724
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Slurs, feminist t-shirt.

1725
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,200
Nice trilby, it's very dapper.

1726
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:41,200
Slurs, man-hater, feminazi, prude, witch, bigot.

1727
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,080
Wait, bigot?

1728
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,200
Are we reclaiming bigot now?

1729
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?

1730
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,200
Joanne wrote in her essay

1731
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,600
that she was standing up in solidarity

1732
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,880
with women who have histories like mine

1733
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,440
who've been slurred as bigots

1734
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,440
for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

1735
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,280
Slurred as bigots.

1736
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,200
There's something so revealing about the claim

1737
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,160
that bigot is a slur,

1738
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,360
because so much of indirect bigotry

1739
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,360
is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.

1740
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,840
Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?

1741
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,480
It's good, it's very clever.

1742
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,600
A white racist will hardly ever use

1743
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,480
the phrase white supremacy.

1744
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:29,520
No, they say white genocide, always on the defensive.

1745
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,240
And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.

1746
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,440
The same conservative media,

1747
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,800
who 10 years ago were portraying lesbians

1748
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,880
as like angry mannish dicks,

1749
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,880
have now created this mythology of lesbians

1750
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,560
as these virginal damsels in distress

1751
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,680
who are threatened with invasion,

1752
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,880
and now extinction.

1753
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,800
On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists

1754
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,520
who are somehow coercing them into becoming men,

1755
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,200
Elliot, no, you can't possibly be doing this

1756
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,440
because you're 33 years old

1757
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,200
and capable of autonomous thought.

1758
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,720
Clearly, you are tricked

1759
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,720
by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.

1760
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,480
And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told,

1761
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,920
are slurring as bigots.

1762
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,000
Lesbians who won't sleep with them.

1763
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,160
Joanne claims that,

1764
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,400
none of the gender critical women I've talked to

1765
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,720
hates trans people.

1766
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,520
On the contrary, many of them become interested

1767
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,080
in this issue in the first place

1768
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,000
out of concern for trans youth,

1769
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,400
and they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults

1770
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,440
who simply want to live their lives.

1771
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,080
But the only gender critical women she mentions by name

1772
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,800
are Maya Forstater, who I would not describe

1773
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,960
as hugely sympathetic to trans adults,

1774
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,880
and Magdalene Burns, about whom Joanne says,

1775
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,360
Magdalene was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian.

1776
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,000
Magdalene was a great believer

1777
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,360
in the importance of biological sex

1778
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,040
and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots

1779
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,920
for not dating trans women with penises.

1780
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,640
Okay, so I agree it would be awful to call someone a bigot

1781
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,960
just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis,

1782
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,240
but are you sure that's why people

1783
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,360
call Magdalene Burns a bigot?

1784
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,560
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else

1785
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,080
about trans women that might lead people

1786
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,840
to think she's less than hugely sympathetic?

1787
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,200
You are fucking blackface actors.

1788
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,320
You aren't women, you're men who get sexual kicks

1789
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,160
from being treated like women.

1790
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,880
Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.

1791
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,520
Our oppression isn't a fetish, you pathetic, sick fuck.

1792
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,280
Hugely sympathetic, hugely sympathetic.

1793
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:48,160
Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic

1794
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,040
to trans people and just don't want to be called bigots,

1795
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,360
and because she constantly frames herself

1796
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,880
as the victim of terrifying trans activists

1797
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,120
who say mean things online,

1798
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,080
I think it's fair for me to mention that this right here

1799
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,660
is how I'm used to being spoken to

1800
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,440
and spoken about by TERFs.

1801
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,360
When you're a trans woman online,

1802
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,120
TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.

1803
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,360
They deadname and misgender you, they mock your genitals,

1804
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,560
they describe your surgery results

1805
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,840
as necrotic mutilated wounds,

1806
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,740
they interpret your every feeling and experience

1807
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,160
as the manifestation of a sick woman-hating fetish.

1808
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,880
You know, in an unrelated video last year,

1809
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,880
I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man,

1810
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,200
and I've since been told by TERFs,

1811
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:43,200
essentially, trans-identified males get sexual kicks

1812
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,040
from being treated like women.

1813
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,800
Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.

1814
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,200
Hugely sympathetic.

1815
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:55,320
I hope I don't even need to say that the idea

1816
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,040
that trans women can't be raped because we'll just enjoy it

1817
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,480
is a violently anti-feminist thought,

1818
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,120
and it's a thought that could only be believed,

1819
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,800
and believed in the name of feminism, no less,

1820
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,840
by people who have spent days and weeks

1821
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,820
absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda

1822
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,400
that TERF forums exist to promote.

1823
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,400
Now I think if Joanne Rowling was in the room

1824
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,480
with me right now, she'd say,

1825
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,800
"'I'm so sorry you've been treated that way,

1826
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,140
"'but I too have been cruelly victimized online

1827
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,080
"'by the trans activists.'"

1828
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,040
And you know what?

1829
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,520
I'm sure that's true.

1830
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,240
When I listen to Joanne talk

1831
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,320
about being victimized by trans Twitter,

1832
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,120
it's easy for me to sympathize,

1833
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,760
because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.

1834
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,040
The vilification, the obsession,

1835
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,880
the fantasies of violence.

1836
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,400
It's a pretty common occurrence

1837
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,040
for me to look up my mentions

1838
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,640
and see people with trans flag avatars

1839
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,120
posting things like,

1840
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,960
"'Point of view, you are truescum

1841
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,680
"'and Yoshi is gonna beat you to death with a golf club.'"

1842
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Hashtag yes all gamers.

1843
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,000
Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-semite

1844
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,540
because three years ago I made a joke

1845
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,200
about reptilian overlords,

1846
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,360
and then they get mad because I said

1847
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,400
I wanted to understand non-binary people

1848
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,760
instead of just dogmatically believing things,

1849
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,960
and they conclude,

1850
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,560
"'So basically, fuck ContraPoints,

1851
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,280
"'I wanna bash her over the goddamn head

1852
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,040
"'with a metal bat over and over again.'"

1853
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,240
So this is the level of antipathy

1854
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,480
that I attract from trans Twitter.

1855
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,720
So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed

1856
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,520
by abusive messages,

1857
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,280
I'm inclined to believe her.

1858
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,320
I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed

1859
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,880
with anime avatars saying things like,

1860
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,560
"'J.K. Rowling is hypocritical trash

1861
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,000
"'who literally waltz millions of trans kids dead.'"

1862
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,960
"'Harry Potter was always neoliberal,

1863
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,220
"'garbage, and we should have seen this coming.'"

1864
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,460
"'This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy,

1865
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,240
"'she deserves a backhand slap to the face.'"

1866
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,020
And tweets like that are abusive.

1867
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,380
It's not okay, and I don't make any excuses for it.

1868
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,920
I wanna make a dark and stormy.

1869
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,280
Sorry, I'll be right back.

1870
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,240
Hey, I'm back.

1871
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,080
It's good.

1872
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,120
So I also think that there really is

1873
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,480
an element of misogyny to them.

1874
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,780
I had to put the drink down, it's making me laugh.

1875
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:15,780
You cannot talk about misogynistic cyberbullying

1876
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,800
while holding a tropical drink.

1877
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,040
It's just not possible to do with a straight face.

1878
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,200
So I agree, there really is an element of misogyny to this.

1879
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,720
Misogyny is the most universal prejudice,

1880
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,840
and trans people are not immune.

1881
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women,

1882
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,320
regardless of whether their anger is justified.

1883
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,160
There is a witch hunt impulse

1884
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,160
that's still alive in our culture.

1885
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,280
To be a famous woman is to constantly have

1886
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,320
every part of your body and soul

1887
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,680
subject to endless critique.

1888
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,280
You know, if you're one pound overweight,

1889
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,480
they call you a fatty.

1890
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,960
If you're one pound underweight,

1891
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,880
they say you have an eating disorder.

1892
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
And if you're exactly the right weight,

1893
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,720
they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.

1894
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,640
You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.

1895
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,040
There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.

1896
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,420
When you're a famous woman,

1897
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:06,520
it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters,

1898
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,720
because the haters bring the obsession to you.

1899
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,920
But it's important to remember

1900
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,080
that haters are not the same as bigots.

1901
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,760
Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry,

1902
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,760
unless it's tied to a history of oppression

1903
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,680
or a backlash against a movement of equality.

1904
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:29,440
So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.

1905
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,040
And no, David Silverman, the word racist

1906
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,800
is not like the N-word.

1907
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,240
And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.

1908
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,920
Turf is not a slur.

1909
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,360
And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse,

1910
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,680
but it's not a form of oppression.

1911
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,600
And I say this as someone, at this point,

1912
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,560
most known for complaining about cancel culture.

1913
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,220
Oh god, is this my legacy?

1914
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,560
A lot of trans people have been very mean,

1915
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,280
verbally abusive even, to JK Rowling.

1916
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,480
But most people criticizing Joanne,

1917
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,960
or criticizing me for that matter,

1918
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,320
might be hurt and angry, but they're not violent.

1919
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,200
But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands

1920
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,000
of messages full of hurt and anger and hate,

1921
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,360
you experience it as one huge tidal wave of loathing

1922
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,560
crashing over you all at once.

1923
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,860
And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent,

1924
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,640
they become emblematic of the way

1925
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,560
the whole experience feels.

1926
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,600
And if you've been the victim of abuse before,

1927
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,160
the experience can be pretty triggering.

1928
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:37,760
So it's just not always as simple as the victim,

1929
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,360
and the abuser.

1930
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,080
Sometimes victims are also abusers.

1931
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,520
Sometimes abusers have a history of victimization.

1932
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,480
Sometimes righteously angry people

1933
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,280
cross a line into abusive excess.

1934
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,640
And not all abuse comes from a position of power.

1935
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,720
Why are so many trans people on Twitter

1936
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,800
so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?

1937
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,880
Well, there's a passage in Conflict Is Not Abuse

1938
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,720
that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter

1939
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,520
as it does to TERFs.

1940
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,600
People living in unrecovered trauma

1941
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,600
often behave in very similar ways

1942
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,280
to the people who traumatize them.

1943
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,640
Over and over, I have seen traumatized people

1944
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,400
refuse to hear or engage information

1945
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,280
that would alter their self-concepts,

1946
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,680
even in ways that could bring them

1947
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,540
more happiness and integrity.

1948
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,160
The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal

1949
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,740
is rooted in a panic that their fragile self

1950
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,460
cannot bear interrogation,

1951
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,380
that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.

1952
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,220
Perhaps because supremacy in some

1953
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:39,900
produces trauma in others, they can become mirror images.

1954
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,860
And of course, many perpetrators

1955
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,260
were or are victims themselves.

1956
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,860
A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,

1957
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,500
and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse

1958
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,820
at trans people, a vulnerable group

1959
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:56,300
who they can mostly get away with hurting.

1960
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,500
Unlike standing up to powerful men, right,

1961
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,100
which would be dangerous and difficult.

1962
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,100
And a lot of trans people have been

1963
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,260
very horribly treated by men, by TERFs,

1964
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,480
by strangers on the street, by their own families.

1965
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,500
And for some of those trans people,

1966
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,740
canceling celebrities on Twitter

1967
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,340
is the one kind of power they have.

1968
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:19,820
Plus, a lot of extremely online trans people

1969
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:22,780
really don't have a strong sense of conviction

1970
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,940
in their own identity, which is why they need

1971
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,260
constant external validation to prop them up.

1972
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,500
They need to constantly be told that they're valid,

1973
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,020
that they really are the gender that they say they are.

1974
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,820
And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions

1975
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:41,520
their fragile self-concept, they lash out,

1976
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,540
Twitter being their only weapon.

1977
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,260
You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay

1978
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,180
that all you're asking, all you want,

1979
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,020
is empathy and understanding.

1980
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,820
And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.

1981
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,540
But trans people also deserve more empathy

1982
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,500
and understanding than you've given them.

1983
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,340
Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts

1984
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,460
that are always raging against you

1985
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,140
and raging against me, for that matter.

1986
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,620
In between the raging, look at what they're doing.

1987
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:13,140
They're begging, begging for money to pay for healthcare,

1988
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,300
begging for money to pay for housing.

1989
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:19,540
You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,

1990
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:24,540
or pounds, or gringotts, or whatever you people have.

1991
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:26,140
And trans people are out here

1992
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,860
literally begging for healthcare.

1993
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,580
They're begging, Joanne.

1994
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,980
How powerful could the trans agenda really be?

1995
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,300
Joanne, you have so much power and influence,

1996
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,380
many, many times more than what I have.

1997
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,900
And I have much more power and influence

1998
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,700
than most trans people.

1999
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,900
You know, I am in a very different situation

2000
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,140
than most trans people.

2001
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,040
I have a lot of other things going for me in this world,

2002
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,660
but a lot of them have nothing.

2003
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:56,140
They have nothing, Joanne.

2004
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:00,260
And I just, I think you should take that into consideration

2005
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,620
next time you decide to speak out

2006
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:05,280
about how trans activists are oppressing you.

2007
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,980
Get it together, Gorge.

2008
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,220
Are you listening to yourself?

2009
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,420
What are you doing, Joanne?

2010
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,900
You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life

2011
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,940
being rejected and humiliated and excluded

2012
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,580
over and over again.

2013
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:20,300
So they're traumatized, they're easily triggered

2014
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,100
by anything that reminds them of past betrayal

2015
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,260
and abandonment, which is something

2016
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,420
I think you could empathize with.

2017
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,020
Joanne, you are famous for writing a book

2018
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:33,580
about a neglected and abused boy who lives in a closet

2019
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,180
until he's whisked away to a magical world

2020
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:37,860
where he and his freaky friends

2021
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,620
find acceptance in each other.

2022
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,860
I remember when I first met you all.

2023
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:45,260
Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.

2024
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:46,700
We're still a bunch of misfits.

2025
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,420
Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.

2026
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:53,280
So many trans people have found comfort in this story

2027
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,580
and an escape from a world that doesn't offer

2028
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,660
a lot of comfort to trans people.

2029
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:01,660
So for you to use your fame and influence

2030
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:05,980
to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,

2031
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:08,820
it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.

2032
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,980
And I don't blame them for feeling that way.

2033
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,460
I feel it too.

2034
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,460
So, Joanne.

2035
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,820
Jo.

2036
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,060
Mother.

2037
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,580
I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.

2038
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,500
I know how much that sucks,

2039
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,580
so if you ever wanna take me up on it,

2040
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,660
I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.

2041
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,860
But otherwise, I think we're done here.

2042
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,180
As a trans person, I like to believe

2043
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,180
in the power of human metamorphosis.

2044
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,780
But I realize that at this point,

2045
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:36,740
you're being constantly love-bombed by transphobes

2046
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,940
and constantly trashed by trans people,

2047
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,940
so it would be pretty difficult

2048
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,620
to change tracks at this point.

2049
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,660
You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off,

2050
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:48,300
and I don't know, Joanne, maybe you are one in a million.

2051
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:49,860
I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban,

2052
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,580
and that shit got me through fifth grade,

2053
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:54,580
so who knows, maybe you have another miracle in you.

2054
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,780
But I'm too old to believe in magic now,

2055
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,540
so I'm not gonna sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.

2056
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,940
Okay.

2057
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:04,980
I guess that's it.

2058
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,940
