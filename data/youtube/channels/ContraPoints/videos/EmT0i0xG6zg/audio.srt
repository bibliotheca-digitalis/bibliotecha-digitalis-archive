1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Sar, I'm gonna talk about Joe Roe once again.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,360
But first, story time.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Chapter one, Anita.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,800
The most famous bigot in American LGBT history

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,240
is a woman called Anita Bryant.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,120
This is her story.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,540
1977 was not a good time to be gay.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,920
Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,920
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,240
into national consciousness.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,060
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,320
and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,100
declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,940
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,380
and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,940
We have abnormal urges, and we will not be silenced.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,960
Because that's the only way to get anything done

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,420
in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,660
They give you no choice.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,740
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,640
known for such popular cities as Miami,

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,600
approved a law that added the phrase

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,020
affectional or sexual preference

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,000
to its nondiscrimination ordinance,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,940
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,000
on the basis of sexual orientation.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,900
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,220
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,140
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,900
who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,700
and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,220
♪ Come to the Florida sunshine tree ♪

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,020
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,180
any time of day.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,740
Orange juice from Florida!

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,900
It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,340
♪ Orange juice with natural vitamin C ♪

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,840
♪ From the Florida sunshine tree ♪

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,040
A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
Breakfast without orange juice

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,600
is like a day without sunshine.

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,440
Cute.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
When Anita heard her pastor speak

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
about this nondiscrimination ordinance,

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,680
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
How touching.

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
According to the word of God,

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,960
it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,020
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,100
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner, saying,

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,300
As a concerned mother of four children,

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,380
I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.

55
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
I have never condoned nor taught my children

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,320
discrimination against anyone.

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,380
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

58
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,820
you will, in fact, be infringing upon my rights

59
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,760
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,780
to teach my children God's moral code

61
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,660
as stated in the holy scriptures.

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,960
Anita, kill your shitty child.

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
When the amendment passed,

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
Anita created a campaign for its repeal,

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,760
the Save Our Children Coalition,

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,800
which sponsored provocative TV ads

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,040
implying that gay people are degenerates

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
who ruin communities and seduce children.

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,600
The campaign has been vicious.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
With television commercials,

71
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
the Save Our Children group is appealing

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
to parental anxieties,

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,000
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
before impressionable children.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,220
The Orange Bowl Parade,

76
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,620
Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

77
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,900
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,740
it's a parade of homosexuals,

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,700
men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,140
Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,220
to gay rights in the United States,

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,140
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

83
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,740
On one side were the gay rights activists

84
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,180
who argued that non-discrimination

85
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,860
was a matter of human rights.

86
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,540
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
that the non-discrimination ordinance

88
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,680
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,040
We all believe in human rights,

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,800
but we don't believe human rights

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
that would corrupt our children

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,600
or for individuals to have special privileges

93
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
that would go against the constitutional rights

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
of normal America.

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,240
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

96
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,080
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

97
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,880
In other words, gay people already have equal rights,

98
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,120
just as long as they stay in the closet

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,840
and don't do anything gay.

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,980
That's very helpful.

101
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,500
Thank you so much, Anita,

102
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,500
for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.

103
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,700
As long as they do their job

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,140
and do not want to come out of the closet

105
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,820
and force their homosexuality on me

106
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,220
in the areas of business or in the schools,

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,100
they can live their life,

108
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,300
and we're not going out after their jobs

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,060
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

110
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,620
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals

111
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,440
to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,520
Just biologically, that God made mothers

113
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
so that we could reproduce.

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,080
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

115
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,720
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,240
It's the exact same argument that's being used today

117
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
by right-wing politicians

118
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,040
who claim that queer people are groomers.

119
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,520
Stop confusing our babies

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,160
with your groomer gender ideologue.

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,600
This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,420
Sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books,

123
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,980
and she believes in traditional marriage

124
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,060
between a man and a woman,

125
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,020
and in that book, it talked about two moms.

126
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,500
Stay away from the children creep, or you will regret it.

127
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,820
People should definitely arm themselves.

128
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,660
I agree with that.

129
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,620
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

130
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,900
The Democrats are the party of teachers,

131
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,180
elementary school teachers,

132
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,260
trying to transition their elementary school-age children

133
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,300
and convince them they're a different gender.

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,380
They're just evil people, and they want to groom kids.

135
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,800
They're recruiting.

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,040
If you don't know what furries are,

137
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,960
it's where school children dress up as animals,

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,520
cats or dogs, during the school day.

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,920
They meow and they bark.

140
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,160
What a great country we live in.

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,040
I love it so much.

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
Gay people around the country

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,280
rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,120
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,

145
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,080
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

146
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
and replacing them with an apple juice

147
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,020
and vodka cocktail called Anita Bryant.

148
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,060
Let's make one now.

149
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,180
Forgot my cocktail measure,

150
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,660
so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

151
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,460
Just a dash of apple juice.

152
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,860
Give it a stir.

153
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,420
Needs a garnish.

154
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,260
Stunning.

155
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,780
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,

156
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
but if I was in the 70s,

157
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,940
I would've thrown back so many of these goddamn things

158
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,620
out of pure spite.

159
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,300
There's a story that Troy Perry,

160
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,860
the founder of the gay-affirming

161
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Metropolitan Community Church,

162
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,840
was on a transcontinental flight,

163
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
on his tray, he said,

165
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,760
take that away, I'm a homosexual.

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,240
At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,

167
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,880
anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently

168
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,080
on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.

169
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,320
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

170
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

171
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
True.

172
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired

173
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
more anti-gay legislation,

174
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,460
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,

175
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,600
both of which passed in the Florida Senate,

176
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,640
as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,

177
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,880
which would've forced public schools to fire gay teachers.

178
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,980
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

179
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,940
She was an influential bigot.

180
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,040
But she may also have helped to unify

181
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,080
and galvanize gay activists

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,200
by providing them with a common enemy.

183
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
According to historian Lillian Federman,

184
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
Anita Bryant created fervent activists

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,820
out of those who'd previously been content

186
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,260
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

187
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,620
Federman cites Eric Hoffer's observation

188
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,780
that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,

189
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,060
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

190
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,020
For gay people all over the country,

191
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,460
Anita Bryant became that devil.

192
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,660
I think that she is rallying the community together

193
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,180
like I have never seen before.

194
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,980
There's no way I could've done it on my own.

195
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,620
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal

196
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,900
to repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance,

197
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,380
there is no question that in the long term,

198
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,220
Anita Bryant was the loser.

199
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,740
She took a lot of Ls.

200
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,580
Rip.

201
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,780
That must be super hard for her.

202
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
For the short remainder of her career,

203
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,140
gay activists protested her events,

204
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,860
they shut down the tour for her book

205
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,980
about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

206
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,280
and they succeeded in turning public opinion

207
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,220
against Anita Bryant to the point

208
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,380
that she became virtually unemployable

209
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,940
in mainstream entertainment.

210
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,380
And a help that she came across

211
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,180
as kind of a judgmental prude

212
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,900
that even hip straight people

213
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,100
didn't want to be associated with.

214
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,700
Our top story tonight,

215
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,180
Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress

216
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,060
and orange juice promoter,

217
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,500
performed coitus in public yesterday

218
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,980
and started a campaign to promote heterosexuality.

219
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,900
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

220
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,980
Like she famously told Playboy magazine.

221
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,380
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

222
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,980
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit

223
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,220
of the tree of life.

224
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,100
God referred to men as trees

225
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,

226
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,980
which is male sperm.

227
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,300
Oh my God.

228
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,740
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

229
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,460
This is how you lose the culture war.

230
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,860
♪ So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita ♪

231
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,660
♪ That's the energy we're surrounded by ♪

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,220
And of course, there was the famous incident

233
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,020
where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie

234
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,420
in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

235
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,700
And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia

236
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,220
and were met with protest and all kinds of problems.

237
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,060
And every-

238
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,940
Oh!

239
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,660
Security agents, security agents.

240
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
No, no, let him stay.

241
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,180
No. Let him stay.

242
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,060
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

243
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated

244
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,740
the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998

245
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,260
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

246
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,660
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face

247
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,220
when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

248
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,900
announcing her marriage to a woman

249
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,940
and publicly struggling with whether to even invite

250
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,620
her grandmother to the ceremony.

251
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,220
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that

252
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,180
like an integral part of your identity

253
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,540
is just an evil delusion.

254
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,620
That it is, Sarah.

255
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,420
That it is.

256
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,300
So that's the story of Anita Bryant

257
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,820
as students of LGBT history know it.

258
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,260
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

259
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,660
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

260
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,700
The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

261
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,420
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

262
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,740
A plague on both their houses.

263
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,020
Isn't it cruel even to slur Anita

264
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,060
as a bigot and a homophobe?

265
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,340
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

266
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,380
was the real victim?

267
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,700
Oh no.

268
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh no!

269
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,380
I can't do this anymore.

270
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,220
I'm eating my pie.

271
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,580
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

272
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,980
Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

273
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,820
God help us all.

274
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,180
The mainstream media would have us believe

275
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,940
that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,

276
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,060
some kind of hateful bigot.

277
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,340
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic

278
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,860
used to silence valid concerns?

279
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,700
Mothers in this country are worried about their children

280
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,460
going to school to be taught by perverts.

281
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,380
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals

282
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,580
weren't the real bigots?

283
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,860
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

284
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,300
was the first victim of cancel culture,

285
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,940
of, dare I say it, wokeism?

286
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,140
Well, no, that's the dumbest thing

287
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,700
I've ever heard in my entire life.

288
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,340
But suppose that you're an idiot,

289
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,020
and suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.

290
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,940
Well, what would be your argument?

291
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,500
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head

292
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,460
and forced me to make that argument,

293
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,900
I'd probably say something like this.

294
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

295
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,500
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty

296
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,060
in rural Oklahoma.

297
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,660
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

298
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,620
the same year she made her singing debut

299
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,380
at the Baptist Church.

300
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,620
Parts of my childhood,

301
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,700
I blocked out because it hurts too much.

302
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,060
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,

303
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,460
and my parents were remarried,

304
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,380
and I was baptized and came to know Christ

305
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,940
as my personal savior.

306
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,100
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

307
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,620
It was real painful,

308
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,460
and it just about killed my mother.

309
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,500
She was a very submissive wife.

310
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,260
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

311
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,540
She let my dad step all over her.

312
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,940
Because of him, I think I went through life

313
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
for a long time hating all men.

314
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,340
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory

315
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,700
as a feeling of intense ambition.

316
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,220
A relentless drive to succeed

317
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,180
at doing well the thing I loved.

318
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,180
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

319
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,580
♪ His truth is marching on ♪

320
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,900
But Anita's ambition conflicted

321
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,340
with her submissive role

322
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,700
as a traditional Christian woman.

323
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,540
In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,

324
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,180
Miami's top disc jockey,

325
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,300
with only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

326
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

327
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,140
Yeah.

328
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,180
Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

329
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,220
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

330
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,500
Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty

331
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,220
nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

332
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,940
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

333
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,100
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

334
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,020
But while submitting to her husband

335
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,980
and raising four children,

336
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,020
Anita was still able to build the career

337
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,220
she'd always wanted.

338
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,660
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,

339
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,820
earning half a million dollars a year,

340
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,100
enough to move her family

341
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,900
into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

342
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,340
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

343
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,860
Did she really deserve to lose it all?

344
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
Just because she took a stand

345
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,140
for something she believed in?

346
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,900
Anita Bryant's role as a leader

347
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,940
in the campaign against homosexuals

348
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,500
may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice.

349
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,140
Are you being blackballed?

350
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,660
Well, it looks that way.

351
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,940
It's worse than that.

352
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,820
We're being threatened,

353
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,020
and there's all kinds of harassment,

354
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,660
even with my job with Florida Citrus.

355
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,260
I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother

356
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,340
to defend her children and all children

357
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,100
against their being recruited by homosexuals.

358
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,740
Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.

359
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,380
She'd been dropped as spokesperson by the orange growers.

360
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,740
She had been dropped as a commentator

361
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,460
on the Orange Bowl parade.

362
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
She lost a television show contract.

363
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,220
Her bookings dropped drastically.

364
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,220
It destroys the dream that I have had since I was a child

365
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,540
to entertain and present wholesome subjects

366
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,420
to my fellow Americans

367
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,220
because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.

368
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,940
No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant

369
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,260
for taking a public stand on something she believed in.

370
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,580
I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house

371
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,740
in a fetal position and wanting to die.

372
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,820
Gay activists in the 1970s

373
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,700
didn't exactly limit their tactics

374
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,860
to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.

375
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,660
Stop Anita now!

376
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,460
Stop Anita now!

377
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
Stop Anita now!

378
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,460
Homosexuals started fighting back.

379
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,980
The gays formed new groups

380
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,420
and picketed the performers' public appearances,

381
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,100
forcing her to cancel a few.

382
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,700
Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.

383
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,620
They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.

384
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,500
They blamed her for hate crimes.

385
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
They burned her in effigy.

386
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,740
They disrupted events she was involved in.

387
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,380
They printed toilet paper with her face on it.

388
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,260
Some sent Anita death threats.

389
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,180
Or they mailed her rotting oranges,

390
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,020
dead cockroaches, human excrement.

391
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,620
See, this is how you canceled people before phones.

392
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,980
Instead of shitposting,

393
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,660
you would simply mail actual human shit

394
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,420
through the United States Postal Service.

395
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,980
Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night.

396
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,300
Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.

397
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,580
How would you men feel if you opened a letter

398
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,380
and there was a photo of your wife's head

399
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,980
superimposed on some other female nude body

400
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,500
in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?

401
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,540
I can imagine quite a lot.

402
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,060
I do think it would be fair to say

403
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,660
that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.

404
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,060
Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,

405
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,100
particularly lesbian feminists,

406
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,700
abhorred the sexist terms that were being used

407
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,420
to characterize Anita Bryant.

408
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,620
Bitch and whore, gay men called her.

409
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,640
The harassment escalated to the point

410
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,900
where Anita had to cancel her book tour

411
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,660
due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.

412
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,780
And of course, there was the pie.

413
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,420
Oh!

414
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,980
So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.

415
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,820
It's kind of a deep cut.

416
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.

417
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,940
Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,

418
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,300
but what about Anita's right to free speech?

419
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,660
I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.

420
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,140
Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book

421
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,380
Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee

422
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,820
that the orange shoes boycott reminded him

423
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,820
of a little thing called McCarthyism.

424
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,440
Have you ever considered that being pro-gay

425
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,940
is quite similar to being anti-gay

426
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,060
in that both are opinions?

427
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,400
As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God

428
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,960
were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.

429
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,360
The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,

430
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,400
religious and civic leaders in opposition

431
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,800
to a well-organized, highly financed,

432
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,160
and politically militant group of homosexual activists.

433
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,000
We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,

434
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,320
and deniers of basic human rights.

435
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,440
And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned

436
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,200
for our children and our community.

437
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
So Anita's version of the story is that she

438
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,440
and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers

439
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,160
were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia

440
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,760
of gay extremists all because they had

441
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,240
a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual

442
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,880
cavorting with little boys.

443
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
Cavorting with little boys.

444
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?

445
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,120
Until the Dade County Ordinance,

446
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
Anita was a registered Democrat

447
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,200
and considered herself a liberal.

448
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
And she never said that she hated gay people

449
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,840
or wanted them dead.

450
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,800
In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.

451
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,960
I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.

452
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,120
I love them enough to tell them the truth

453
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,680
because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals

454
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,680
that if they're willing to turn from sin

455
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,360
the same as any individual,

456
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
that they can be ex-homosexuals

457
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,320
the same as there can be an ex-murderer,

458
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,880
an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.

459
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,280
She loves homosexuals because they can change.

460
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,120
Just like murderers.

461
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,280
Would a bigot have said that?

462
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
Just about McFuckin' had it.

463
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Anita was so kind-hearted,

464
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,200
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

465
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
I can relate to the homosexual

466
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

467
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
I really felt the rejection of my father

468
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
and that is one of the things

469
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,080
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

470
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,180
Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,

471
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,100
no matter what they think of my motives.

472
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,480
I've always said I love the sinner

473
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,600
but I hate the sin.

474
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,240
Wow, what an empath.

475
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,120
You know, I actually think it's really noble

476
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,340
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

477
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,760
onto the marginalized group

478
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,520
whose rights she's trying to take away.

479
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,880
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing

480
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,760
to both sides, to many sides.

481
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,880
We've considered all the evidence.

482
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

483
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,840
and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve

484
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,320
that pie to the face?

485
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,160
Well, yes, obviously.

486
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Look, the point I'm trying to make here

487
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,600
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

488
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,680
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality

489
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,800
and to twist them into fucked up apologia

490
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,920
for horrible oppressive behavior.

491
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,640
If you play this game long enough,

492
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,380
you can essentially explain away

493
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,400
the entire concept of bigotry

494
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

495
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
There's only tragically misunderstood people

496
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,440
with difficult childhoods and valid concerns

497
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,800
cruelly demonized by militant activists

498
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,880
defaming and silencing them

499
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,960
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

500
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Now, because you, viewers,

501
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,280
are smart, media-literate people,

502
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,400
you understand framing, so you already know

503
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,900
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.

504
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,800
In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling, ugh.

505
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,200
J.K. Rowling is a popular author

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,720
who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

507
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,880
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers

508
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
masturbating into stolen panties

509
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,040
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

510
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.

511
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,240
Christ, what a nightmare.

512
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,360
Chapter three, the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

513
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,600
All right, kids, it's transcend time.

514
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast

515
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,280
about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,

516
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,440
an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church,

517
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
the notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,

518
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,660
most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers

519
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,920
with signs that say, God hates f**ks.

520
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,880
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

521
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,760
J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church

522
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,080
is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups

523
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,000
in the world.

524
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

525
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,760
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.

526
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,480
I went to a counter protest in 2010.

527
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,440
I remember how when I was in high school,

528
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,240
the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing

529
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,920
that conservatives and liberals could agree on

530
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,280
because they hated the troops and the gays,

531
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,600
essentially the two genders of 2006.

532
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
But let's not pretend

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,800
that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

534
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,760
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,

535
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,080
she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies

536
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,040
about how the gays are going to hell,

537
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,440
which to this day, I am a big fan of.

538
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,040
♪ But what did you say, you think God loves your brain? ♪

539
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,560
♪ He hates all you do because you love fornicating. ♪

540
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,440
♪ Fornicating. Fornicating. ♪

541
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,520
It's perfect.

542
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
I love it.

543
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,760
Play it at my funeral.

548
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,680
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012

549
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,480
after a crisis of faith precipitated

550
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,080
by a power struggle within the church.

551
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,000
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,

552
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
which is honestly a pretty interesting account

553
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,160
of deconversion and the circumstances

554
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,640
that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

555
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,080
Megan contacted me for her podcast

556
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,640
because I had criticized JK Rowling

557
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,680
in a video a couple years ago.

558
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,720
Now you may be wondering,

559
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,360
why would I think that a person who's been carrying

560
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,880
a God hates sign most of her life

561
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
would be the correct person

562
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,520
to lead an international conversation

563
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,440
about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

564
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,240
Because I'm an idiot.

565
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Happy?

566
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,520
Basically, I agreed to the podcast

567
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,920
because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

568
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,040
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church

569
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,320
wants to mediate a conversation between me

570
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,360
and the author of Harry Potter.

571
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,160
Would you say no to that?

572
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Maybe, if you're smart.

573
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Last month, the podcast was announced

574
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,

575
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,280
obviously a tendentious framing that posits JoRoe

576
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,520
as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.

577
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,480
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling

578
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,000
complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

579
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,640
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob

580
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,320
holding a rotten hell Rowling sign

581
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

582
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

583
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,840
This did not bode well.

584
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,440
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter

585
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,280
because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy

586
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,360
to some kind of unearned JK Rowling redemption tour.

587
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,000
This caused Megan's mom Shirley to quote tweet me

588
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,580
calling me a bigot against God.

589
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,500
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

590
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,960
There's only one of him.

591
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,200
And he could really use your help, Shirley.

592
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,640
I said in these tweets that I felt used,

593
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,960
which that is how I felt,

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,440
but ultimately I need to take full responsibility

595
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,000
for my involvement in this.

596
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this

597
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,600
is you honestly have no idea

598
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,840
what the final product is gonna be like.

599
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,760
So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.

600
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,180
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

601
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,480
There were red flags from the beginning,

602
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,040
and I ignored them because I was projecting my own hopes

603
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,440
onto the situation.

604
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
You know, it's a compelling story.

605
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot

606
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,200
could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.

607
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,640
We all love a good redemption arc,

608
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,640
and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

609
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
That's something I've moved away from,

610
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
but there's still part of me

611
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
that wants to see the best in people

612
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,800
and to believe that people can change

613
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,960
if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.

614
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,600
Maybe my wishful thinking was

615
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,680
that because Megan left Westbro,

616
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,080
that must mean that she must understand

617
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,600
the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

618
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,560
And despite no evidence for this,

619
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,440
my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally

620
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,280
and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe

621
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,000
about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?

622
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,840
Wrong.

is more than seven hours of apologetics for J.K.R.

628

had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

638

I had been becoming increasingly concerned

639

about the way in which women were being shut down.

Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.

641
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,960
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing

642
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,960
of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists

643
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,440
whom Rowling describes as

644
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

645

For the first five hours of this podcast,

646
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob

647
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,360
of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

648
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,400
You are murdering trans children!

649
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Yeah!

650
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,640
Let's get up on time!

651

652

I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

653
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,120
And you did it at my birthday dinner.

654
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
There's this one clip

655
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,080
of some kind of Antifa super soldier's abrasive screaming

656
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,760
that they play, like, once per episode.

657
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,280
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

658
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,120
You look like you got your teeth knocked out,

659
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,680
you fucking fascist!

660
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,920
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares

661
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,640
and you will die alone!

662
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,400
And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks

663
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
chanting some kind of medieval lament.

664
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,080
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

665
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,960
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

666
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Just in case you didn't get from the title

667
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,560
that this is a witch hunt.

668
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,400
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,200
Do you guys get it?

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,840
Do you get it yet?

Let's get up on time!

673
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,720
And then these mobs of irrational,

674
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
misogynistic, trans rights fanatics

675
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,400
are contrasted with this poignant story

676
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,000
of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband

677
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,760
to publish our generation's most beloved novels.

678
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,600
I was still very committed to those parts

679
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

680
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,480
because there was a truth to them

681
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
and there was a power to them.

682
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,320
The only voices of genuine trans dissent

683
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,520
appear in episode six out of seven,

684
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,560
more than five hours in.

685
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,240
And there's only two of us.

686
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,400
One is me, shame,

687
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,760
and the other is a teenager named Noah

688
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,040
who kinda just seems like he wants to be liked

689
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,720
and understood and wishes that his favorite author

690
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
would please stop saying bigoted things about him.

691
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,

692
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,160
or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,

693
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,320
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

694
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
I can't even state how important it was to me.

695
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,680
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography

696
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,800
from my third grade classroom

697
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,640
and I kept it for a long time

698
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,800
because I just loved reading it

699
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,280
because I just admired her so much.

700
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,400
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

701
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,120
On my last day editing this video,

702
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,680
I got in touch with Noah.

703
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,000
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast

704
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,960
he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.

705
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,160
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue

706
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,760
are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.

707
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,240
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

708
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,040
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

709
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,400
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,

710
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
well-being, and ability to survive.

711
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,680
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling

712
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,120
should come second to fighting for maintained access

713
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,640
to healthcare, support, and general resources

714
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,320
for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

715
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,240
I agree.

716
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,200
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

717
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,040
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

718
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,400
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling

719
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,080
is the victim of a witch hunt

720
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,800
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

721
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,960
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

722
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,320
I mean, Turf is basically witch.

723
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,280
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

724
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,520
Show me the actual words, Jack.

725
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,480
Show me where I said I'm the victim

726
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,680
of a witch hunt by trans people.

727
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,000
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,040
Yes, a podcast on which I never once say

729
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

730
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
What are you talking about?

731
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm not scamming the government,

732
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,200
if that's what you're saying.

733
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
Your license plate says scamming.

734
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,280
Uh, no.

735
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,160
What do you mean, no?

736
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,480
Yes.

737
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Joanne, show me where I ever said

738
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,440
that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

739
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Why would you even think that?

740
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,200
You're crazy.

741
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt

742
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,960
for sale now at Wild Womine Workshop.

743
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,920
And Meghan is not much better.

744
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,600
Like, there's this whole section in episode two

745
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,560
where Meghan interviews Christians

746
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,560
who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,

747
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,640
and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

748
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,960
So looking back, would you say that the Christian parents

749
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,280
were maybe part of a moral panic?

750
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,200
Yeah, absolutely.

751
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,080
It's a scary world out there.

752
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,560
Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests

753
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,240
against Joe Roe are equivalent

754
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,600
to the Christian ones in the 90s,

755
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
but she does heavily imply it.

756
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,240
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,

757
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,

758
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,280
to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,

759
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,280
boycotted, and in some cases, burned.

760
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,760
When confronted about the obvious implications

761
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,880
of the podcast's title, Meghan said,

762
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
The title is ambiguous.

763
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,400
Toward the end of her conversations,

764
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,920
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling

765
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,120
about discernment, about how a person can ever know

766
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,240
if they're standing up for what's right

767
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,920
or joining a moral panic.

768
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,640
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

769
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,880
Meghan, I was not surprised.

770
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,120
I know I won't ever regret

771
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,240
having stood up on this issue, ever.

772
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,000
The podcast released new episodes weekly,

773
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,880
and whenever Meghan was challenged

774
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,520
about the blatant one-sidedness, Meghan would respond,

775
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,920
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened

776
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,720
to the whole podcast yet.

777
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

778
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,040
Much more of other perspectives is coming.

779
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,520
Make sure to tune in next week.

780
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,160
More bombshell revelations to come.

781
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,760
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,

782
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,740
and I truly do not think that anyone

783
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,560
with basic media comprehension skills

784
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,360
could come away from this thinking

785
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,100
that the main intent was anything other

786
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,480
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr

787
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,480
of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.

788
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,880
This is the obvious implication of the podcast

789
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,680
from the first words to the very last.

790
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,400
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

791
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,280
The final episode concludes with this.

792
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,480
There are more important things in this world

793
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,200
than being popular, and that doesn't mean

794
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,160
it's more important to me to be right.

795
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,000
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

796
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,400
Why would you end on that note?

797
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,080
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

798
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,140
if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe

799
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,680
that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

800
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,000
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

801
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,080
Like, there really is no other reasonable way

802
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,080
to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.

803
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
If you believe that J.K. Rowling

804
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,080
is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,

805
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,820
then just say that.

806
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,240
Make the argument you want to make.

807
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,920
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

808
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,080
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

809
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,260
Don't rely on innuendo and framing

810
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,260
and lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point

811
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,880
while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda

812
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,640
beyond I just believe in conversation.

813
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,180
I don't know, I just find this a slippery

814
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,120
and dishonest way to argue.

815
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,500
But if you happen to be a fan

816
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,700
of slippery and dishonest arguments,

817
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,700
you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

818
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,340
This video is sponsored by Canabox.

819
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,540
Canabox offers fresh human meat

820
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,780
delivered directly to your doorstep.

821
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,080
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit

822
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,540
the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

823
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,340
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

824
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,060
Whenever a new box arrives,

825
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,440
I get out my copy of Bless This Food,

826
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,840
the Anita Bryant family cookbook.

827
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,400
The best thing about human meat

828
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,080
delivered to your home by mail in the dead of night?

829
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,600
You don't know who you're eating,

830
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,640
so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

831
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,560
Maybe.

832
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,360
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

833
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,320
That means you're not allowed to cancel me.

834
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,600
Chapter four, Joe Rose transphobia.

835
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,440
That's it.

836
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm going full Slytherin.

837
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,900
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

838
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,540
Joe Rose compares trans activists to Death Eaters,

839
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,380
the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

840
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,660
My position is that this activist movement

841
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,300
in the form that it's currently taking

842
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,620
echoes the very thing that I was warning against

843
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,620
in Harry Potter.

844
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,100
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made

845
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,740
to live in secret, and now is our time.

846
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:01,300
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

847
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
misogynistic movement.

848
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
When an article then claimed she had equated

849
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,980
trans people to Death Eaters,

850
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,040
the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,

851
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,360
because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters,

852
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,040
not trans people in general.

853
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,

854
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,280
I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.

855
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,800
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,

856
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,280
lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

857
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,160
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,

858
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,740
because she expresses it as an endless series

859
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,780
of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

860
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,920
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle

861
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,300
consisting of a Mott, that is, a tower atop a mound or hill,

862
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,740
easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard

863
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,300
that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

864
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,780
So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes

865
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,740
a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.

866
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,500
And then, when confronted with counterarguments,

867
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,080
they walk it back to a much less controversial

868
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,600
and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.

869
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,520
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim

870
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,480
like sex is real.

871
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,200
What does she mean by that?

872
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,840
What are the implications?

873
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,420
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks

874
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,640
it's very sinister that in the Associated Press Style Guide,

875
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,740
it says that instead of referring to a trans woman

876
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,360
as a man who identifies as a woman,

877
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,700
journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

878
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,460
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

879
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,760
They've edged from identifies as a woman,

880
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,820
so a man identifies as a woman,

881
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,660
and I think we all understand what that means,

882
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,460
into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep

883
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,540
that I'm talking about.

884
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,340
We are using language to make accurate definition

885
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,380
of sex difference unspeakable.

886
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,940
Which is, of course, false,

887
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,740
because the words trans and cis exist precisely

888
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,220
to make it easy to talk about sex difference.

889
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,900
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

890
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,820
God, there's this whole section of the podcast

891
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,300
that sort of implies that transgender people

892
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,060
were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into

893
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,340
because we don't have time.

894
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,940
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks

895
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,700
that all people who menstruate must be referred to as women.

896
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,860
Or was it wombin?

897
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,380
I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.

898
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,860
So trans men and trans masculine people,

899
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,500
they're all women and must be referred to as women,

900
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,100
because J.K. Rowling demands it.

901
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,680
This is controversial, right?

902
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,740
Calling trans women men who identify as women,

903
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,540
calling trans men women.

904
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,620
This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.

905
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,140
Trans women are men, trans men are women.

906
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,700
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

907
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,040
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,

908
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,600
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

909
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm being persecuted just for saying

910
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,080
that women should be allowed to discuss

911
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,800
how being female has shaped our lives.

912
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
Women should be allowed to discuss

913
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,520
how being female has shaped our lives.

914
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,400
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial

915
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.

916
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,160
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes

917
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,920
make about trans people follows this pattern.

918
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,840
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstater,

919
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,840
will tweet inflammatory things like,

920
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,100
men cannot change into women.

921
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,760
But then when she's criticized,

922
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,680
she'll say that she's being attacked

923
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,760
for gender critical belief.

924
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,400
Gender critical belief,

925
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,040
which is the absolutely ordinary belief about sex,

926
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,000
that your mother and your grandmother are women,

927
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,920
that being female is a thing.

928
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,560
Your mother and grandmother are women.

929
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
Being female is a thing.

930
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,840
That's literally all I'm saying.

931
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,080
But if that's literally all she was saying,

932
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,840
then no one would be mad, would they?

933
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,680
Nine.

934
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,600
Gnar.

935
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,880
Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.

936
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,520
Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.

937
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,760
Your mom's a woman.

938
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,160
Ah!

939
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,880
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

940
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

941
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,680
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

942
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,560
Then when trans people, understandably, get mad,

943
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,720
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked

944
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,120
just for saying that being female is part of my experience.

945
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,160
It's dishonest.

946
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,240
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,

947
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,280
and then when trans people talk trash back,

948
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,920
they pretend that they're being victimized

949
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,080
for making totally innocuous statements.

950
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,760
We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

951
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,840
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met

952
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,440
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,

953
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,640
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on,

954
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,040
I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.

955
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,360
It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.

956
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,920
And somehow it always worked.

957
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,040
So a birthday boy argument is when you make

958
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,440
aggressive, inflammatory assertions,

959
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,200
followed by teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,

960
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,680
when the target reacts with anything

961
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,440
less than extreme politeness.

962
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,880
Another common tactic you'll see

963
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,440
any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed

964
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,240
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

965
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,480
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

966
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,640
For example, here's someone on Twitter

967
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,920
called large gamete producer.

968
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,000
It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist

969
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,880
that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate

970
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,080
is horribly oppressive and degrading,

971
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,960
but then they'll just straight up call themselves

972
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,560
large gamete producer.

973
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,480
Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

974
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,480
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

975
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh, I like it, it's very broodmother.

976
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,520
That Rowling's words regularly appear

977
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,600
in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence

978
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,840
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

979
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,160
She's like their queen, their leader,

980
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,360
their headmistress.

981
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,080
She's the best thing that ever happened to them,

982
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,320
because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading

983
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,160
a lot of people.

984
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,200
If you know, you know.

985
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,440
Large gamete producer says, JK isn't anti-trans.

986
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,000
Give me just one direct quote that she has said

987
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
which is anti-trans.

988
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,700
Oh, what's that?

989
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,240
You can't find one?

990
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,440
Well, color me shocked.

991
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,280
Imagine.

992
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,640
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

993
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,160
let's take a look at large gamete producer's profile.

994
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,720
Trans women are not women, they are men.

995
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Trans men are not men, they are women.

996
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,880
Nothing can change that.

997
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,260
Sex is binary.

998
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,360
Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,

999
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,720
trans men are women is a transphobic statement,

1000
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,400
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

1001
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,640
This is why the first question you should always ask

1002
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,720
such people is, do you believe that transphobia

1003
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,460
is a legitimate concept?

1004
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,160
What are some examples of statements

1005
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,200
that you would consider transphobic?

1006
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,840
Because many of them don't believe

1007
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,080
that transphobia is a valid concept

1008
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,760
because they don't think that trans people

1009
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,400
are a legitimate minority.

1010
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,880
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

1011
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

1012
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,000
There is no such thing.

1013
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,900
There are people that call themselves these things

1014
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,160
that may have other issues manifesting

1015
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,280
that then make them think they're this, but no.

1016
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,960
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

1017
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,700
There may be more words that we have to say

1018
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,640
in order to say that.

1019
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,960
We may call it transgender ideology,

1020
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,480
but when it comes to a person,

1021
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,980
they may be following transgender ideology,

1022
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,520
but they are not transgender.

1023
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,060
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

1024
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,240
being anything other than a man or a woman.

1025
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,600
So when they say, show me an example

1026
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,280
of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said,

1027
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,560
this is a trap.

1028
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,800
They're just messing with you.

1029
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,840
There's nothing that she could have said

1030
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,880
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

1031
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
Now, if you're someone who believes

1032
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,240
that transphobia is a valid concept

1033
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,240
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

1034
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,240
but you just genuinely are unaware

1035
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,560
of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,

1036
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,720
then I will refer you to my past video

1037
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,680
on J.K. Rowling's transphobia

1038
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
rather than recapping it all here.

1039
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

1040
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,560
since I made that video.

1041
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

1042
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,

1043
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,340
because she's not a complete idiot,

1044
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,140
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

1045
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,400
She said, save our children.

1046
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,840
I love homosexuals.

1047
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,780
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

1048
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

1049
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,260
but he will share a lot of statistics

1050
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,140
about anti-white crime.

1051
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,820
So this is not really a very good criterion

1052
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,580
for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

1053
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,460
What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again

1054
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,300
about transgender rapists,

1055
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,180
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

1056
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,320
She implies that trans-inclusive language

1057
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,660
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

1058
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,940
She writes at length about the vague, nefarious cabal

1059
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,100
of endocrinologists and ideologue

1060
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,260
that is supposedly persuading confused,

1061
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,480
vulnerable girls to transition.

1062
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,500
To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,

1063
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,820
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

1064
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,200
but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.

1065
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.

1066
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,020
It asks them to fear.

1067
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,300
It creates phobias of trans people.

1068
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,500
It creates trans phobias.

1069
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,380
If you will.

1070
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,700
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician

1071
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,940
Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights

1072
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,860
via a T-shirt she got from anti-trans hate monger

1073
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,100
Posey Parker.

1074
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,620
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

1075
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,780
There's no such thing as a trans person.

1076
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,740
There is no such thing.

1077
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

1078
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,100
about Rowling's transphobia,

1079
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,140
it's that this is not a case

1080
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,700
of someone posting a couple insensitive tweets

1081
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,380
that got blown out of proportion.

1082
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,220
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent

1083
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,300
of trans rights.

1084
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

1085
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,580
And because she's so famous,

1086
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,420
she's become the de facto global champion

1087
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,340
of backlash to trans rights.

1088
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,980
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

1089
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,820
Except worse, because she's way more famous

1090
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,980
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

1091
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,180
Rowling has also praised self-described

1092
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,020
theocratic fascist Matt Walsh

1093
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,180
for his transphobic propaganda film.

1094
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,140
She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,

1095
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,060
known as Tims among people

1096
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,060
for whom this has become an unhealthy obsession.

1097
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,260
She retweets images of the trans colors

1098
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,240
being erased from the progress flag.

1099
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,700
Also the colors representing queer people of color.

1100
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,060
So, you know, great.

1101
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,900
Love that.

1102
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,580
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

1103
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,600
for the principled and valiant purpose

1104
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,100
of defending lesbians.

1105
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,360
It's something of a fixation for her.

1106
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,460
I find this particularly gross

1107
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,940
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

1108
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,620
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

1109
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,740
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

1110
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,740
of cis people.

1111
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,420
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

1112
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,260
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person

1113
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,680
and also most likely, at 96%,

1114
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,060
to say that they're supportive

1115
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,260
or very supportive of trans people.

1116
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,020
So I think it's fair to say

1117
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,980
that most gay women are probably not super thrilled

1118
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,660
whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.

1119
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,740
My own partner is a cis lesbian

1120
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,140
and I asked her if she enjoys J.K. Rowling

1121
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,460
defending her from the transsexuals and she said,

1122
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,300
"'It makes me wanna gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.'"

1123
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,900
By the way, here is J.K. Rowling enjoying a bit of banter

1124
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,700
with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

1125
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,340
the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.

1126
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,380
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

1127
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,660
of the House of Lords

1128
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,980
who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.

1129
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,860
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

1130
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,060
claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading

1131
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,180
the status of women and girls.

1132
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,180
Truly one of the great lesbian allies.

1133
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,940
And in 2022, here is J.K. Rowling

1134
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,060
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

1135
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,780
"'Excellent question, Emma.

1136
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,180
"'Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

1137
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,220
"'excludes and oppresses the most marginalized

1138
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,840
"'of all groups, i.e. people with penises and beards

1139
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,420
"'who want to shag women.

1140
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,680
"'And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

1141
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,760
"'They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.'"

1142
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,240
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have

1143
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,040
for the Gryffindor common room,

1144
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,680
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

1145
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,920
Two straight women,

1146
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,080
one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,

1147
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,080
having a nice little chuckle together

1148
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,160
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

1149
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,720
So that's it, right?

1150
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,640
It's over.

1151
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,840
Case closed.

1152
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,840
I still like hammering things.

1153
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,560
I'm not gonna argue anymore

1154
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,400
about whether J.K. Rowling is transphobic,

1155
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,880
because anyone who believes in transphobia

1156
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,600
can see that obviously she is.

1157
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,080
The question now is whether transphobia

1158
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,360
is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,

1159
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,400
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

1160
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,320
misogyny, and homophobia.

1161
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,920
That's usually what we're talking about

1162
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,120
when we talk about J.K. Rowling, right?

1163
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

1164
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,480
That's what the witch trials of J.K. Rowling is about.

1165
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,920
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

1166
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,680
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

1167
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,600
worthy of polite consideration and respect

1168
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,760
in liberal humane society?

1169
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,960
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

1170
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,040
that we can justifiably react to

1171
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
with scorn and condemnation?

1172
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,120
And there's an even broader question here

1173
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,640
about whether we can justifiably react to anything

1174
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,520
with scorn and condemnation.

1175
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,920
Is canceling ever warranted?

1176
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,240
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

1177
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,840
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

1178
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas,

1179
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,760
where we can all sit around

1180
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,160
debating the legitimacy of gay marriage

1181
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,200
or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

1182
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Is the final solution a myth

1183
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,840
promulgated by the international Jew?

1184
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,400
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

1185
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,240
Wouldn't the taxpayer save a lot of money

1186
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

1187
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
Who knows?

1188
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,320
These are open questions.

1189
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,080
Let's sit down with people on both sides,

1190
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,160
on many sides, and have calm, civil conversations about it

1191
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

1192
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,280
Chapter five, debate.

1193
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
Sar, I know I did this look before

1194
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
and it's not related to the video topic at all,

1195
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,280
but it just makes me feel sliving.

1196
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,600
The boy who slived.

1197
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,280
So Megan Phelps-Roper's viewpoint

1198
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,480
seems to be that scorn and condemnation

1199
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,120
are never appropriate,

1200
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,000
that we should approach every conflict

1201
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
with empathy and compassion,

1202
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,520
even when dealing with the worst,

1203
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,480
most destructive people in the world.

1204
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,640
Hi, my name is Megan, and my heretical belief

1205
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,240
is that even the people who seem to be

1206
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,120
the worst, most destructive people in the world

1207
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,680
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

1208
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,640
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

1209
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,680
In her book, in her TED talk, in her public appearances,

1210
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,560
Megan expresses the idea that society

1211
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,040
has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way,

1212
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,560
that we've all become extremists,

1213
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,840
that in some sense,

1214
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,560
we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.

1215
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,800
I can't help but see in our public discourse

1216
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,280
so many of the same destructive impulses

1217
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,840
that ruled my former church.

1218
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,280
She identifies things like certainty,

1219
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,320
vilification of compromise,

1220
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,040
us versus them thinking,

1221
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,720
suppression of empathy,

1222
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,440
and celebration of death and misfortune

1223
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,880
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

1224
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,760
And this really bothers Megan,

1225
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,520
because she claims that a decade ago,

1226
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,240
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

1227
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,120
how f*** marriage is abominable to God,

1228
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,400
it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way

1229
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,160
that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

1230
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,120
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

1231
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,880
She's totally right that if you want

1232
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,440
to change people's minds,

1233
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

1234
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,880
is usually the best way to do that.

1235
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,800
But Megan reaches another conclusion

1236
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,240
that I don't agree with,

1237
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,660
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

1238
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,960
are most likely to persuade people,

1239
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,680
we should never cancel anyone,

1240
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,720
even the most horrible bigots.

1241
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,400
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point,

1242
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,520
but what Megan means is

1243
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,800
we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.

1244
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,480
We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest

1245
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,160
or raise our voices.

1246
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,960
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,

1247
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,080
because that's just not how you change minds.

1248
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,040
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

1249
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,880
Deradicalization was a really important part

1250
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,520
of her life experience.

1251
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,220
She's also clearly holding out hope

1252
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,520
that other members of her family will leave Westboro

1253
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,280
and have a life on the outside.

1254
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,560
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

1255
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,880
The last lines of her book address her family.

1256
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,760
I want to tell them that I love them.

1257
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
I'll just have to find another way.

1258
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,680
This is touching and human

1259
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,760
and also kind of a conflict of interest.

1260
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,320
The problem is Megan's views about this

1261
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,120
only make sense if you assume that Megan

1262
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,360
is the main character of reality.

1263
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,600
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

1264
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,880
is more important than protecting the people they target.

1265
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,440
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

1266
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,920
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

1267
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

1268
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,600
and she's still homophobic.

1269
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,720
But even without Anita's blessing,

1270
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,120
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

1271
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,080
since the 1970s, because gay activists

1272
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,720
didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

1273
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,320
They needed to defeat her, and that's what they did.

1274
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,680
We have to accept that realistically,

1275
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,240
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

1276
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,560
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

1277
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,680
but there will always be bigots.

1278
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,160
And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

1279
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,960
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

1280
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,800
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

1281
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,040
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

1282
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,880
Nah.

1283
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,120
You would only think that if you're

1284
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,160
a total moral relativist.

1285
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,200
I guess controversial opinion,

1286
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,920
but bigotry is shameful, and it should be shamed.

1287
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,880
I'll say it.

1288
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,220
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas

1289
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,600
in your head, you might feel afraid

1290
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,800
to express them publicly for fear

1291
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,120
of being shamed or judged.

1292
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,360
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

1293
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,960
that punishes people for wrong-think?

1294
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,440
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful,

1295
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,000
and you should be ashamed of it,

1296
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,600
and the people judging you are right to do so.

1297
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,320
And sure, there are some very patient people

1298
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,360
who devote their lives to deradicalizing bigots,

1299
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,680
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

1300
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,360
There's a guy named Darryl Davis

1301
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

1302
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,800
for over 30 years, and he claims he's convinced

1303
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,200
more than 200 of them to leave.

1304
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,520
And good for him.

1305
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,320
Deradicalization is a valid strategy,

1306
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,800
but it cannot be the only strategy,

1307
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,960
and it must not be the primary strategy.

1308
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,120
Because we're not going to defeat racism

1309
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

1310
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,120
Feminists would be wasting their time

1311
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

1312
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,560
In general, I think that the massive effort

1313
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,360
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

1314
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,120
is better spent persuading other people

1315
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,560
not to listen to them.

1316
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,520
And it's also worth cautioning that deradicalization

1317
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

1318
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Saitanovic

1319
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,820
became the face of the fascist Unite the Right rally

1320
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:44,060
in 2017 when a photo of him mid-scream,

1321
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,740
tiki, torch in hand, was published

1322
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,980
in news outlets all over the country.

1323
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,300
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

1324
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,600
he gave immediately after the rally,

1325
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,940
but he began to question his beliefs

1326
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,620
after befriending a Muslim woman who,

1327
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,940
according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,

1328
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,720
challenged his views without insulting him,

1329
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,080
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

1330
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,360
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

1331
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,380
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

1332
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,100
every trace of bigotry.

1333
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,400
In a 2019 interview with the London School

1334
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,240
of Economics student paper, Peter said,

1335
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,320
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

1336
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,520
You're born either a man or a woman.

1337
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,400
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

1338
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,240
When I did deradicalization work on YouTube,

1339
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,120
I used to get some criticism from people of color

1340
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,280
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

1341
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,800
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

1342
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,240
a frustration that I totally understand.

1343
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,120
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

1344
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,840
diverse leftist communities are maybe not

1345
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,440
the best holding space for someone who's

1346
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,560
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

1347
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,760
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

1348
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,800
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

1349
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,600
but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant

1350
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,180
skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.

1351
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,160
This is pretty common with people who used

1352
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
to be religious fundamentalists.

1353
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,240
They were so certain they were right,

1354
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,760
only to realize that everything they believed

1355
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,440
about the world is wrong.

1356
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,400
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

1357
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,520
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

1358
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,720
Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly

1359
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,660
that I was doing the right thing,

1360
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,440
and then to leave and come to believe

1361
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,660
that it was so destructive and harmful,

1362
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:35,840
I had this moment in time, and it lasted for many months,

1363
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,720
where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?

1364
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,080
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

1365
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,240
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

1366
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,240
can cause problems, especially where topics

1367
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,280
of social justice are concerned.

1368
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,600
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

1369
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,000
that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling

1370
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,800
to have calm, philosophical debates

1371
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,720
about whether they should have rights?

1372
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,960
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

1373
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,120
Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,

1374
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,720
in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

1375
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,080
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

1376
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,600
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

1377
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,760
until we can figure out what's going on.

1378
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,440
Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

1379
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,600
complained that trans activism and activism in general

1380
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,840
is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.

1381
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,720
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability

1382
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,720
and even frank mental illness in the activist community.

1383
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,920
I mean, really, in all activist communities,

1384
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,920
the level of viciousness and hysteria is,

1385
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,360
you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.

1386
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,120
Diversity, when?

1387
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,200
Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

1388
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

1389
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,840
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

1390
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,440
Aren't there certain situations

1391
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,600
where strong emotions are warranted?

1392
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,440
It reminds me of this awful episode

1393
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,960
of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,

1394
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,880
where Lil Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

1395
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,320
with his usual whining sophistry,

1396
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,580
and Joe gently raises objections

1397
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,700
for Ben to talk circles around.

1398
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,140
The human sex drive was made to procreate

1399
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,420
within a stable relationship in order to progenerate

1400
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,220
and have future generations of people.

1401
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,140
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

1402
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,660
whether you're talking about from masturbation

1403
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,820
to homosexual activity, is therefore a diminishment

1404
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,940
of the use of that drive.

1405
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,060
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

1406
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,580
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

1407
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,300
Imagine talking about different beliefs

1408
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,340
while still having a productive conversation.

1409
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,540
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

1410
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,060
The discussion here was excellent.

1411
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,780
Two guys with opposing opinions,

1412
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,420
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

1413
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,700
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

1414
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,300
This is how it should be done.

1415
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,460
Kudos to both of them.

1416
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,700
Joe is a great interviewer.

1417
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,160
He can totally disagree with someone

1418
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,540
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

1419
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,780
This is how it should be.

1420
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,260
Just two people sharing ideas,

1421
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,180
learning different point of views from each other.

1422
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,260
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

1423
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,620
Joe Rogan beautifully asks the tough questions,

1424
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,180
and Ben answers honestly.

1425
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,860
He is strong in his faith.

1426
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,460
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

1427
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,220
and they have a civil conversation.

1428
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,060
Great learning.

1429
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,820
And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men

1430
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,100
to have a dispassionate, theoretical conversation

1431
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,580
about the ethics of homosexuality,

1432
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,940
because it's not their lives and their relationships

1433
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,460
that are up for debate.

1434
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,260
These people don't understand the emotional burden

1435
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,100
placed on marginalized people

1436
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,580
who are asked to defend their rights.

1437
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,140
If you're straight, do you want to publicly debate

1438
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,340
whether your marriage is valid?

1439
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,660
Andrew Dworkin claimed that penetrative

1440
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,380
heterosexual intercourse is inherently an act of violence.

1441
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,620
I've noticed that most straight men

1442
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:06,300
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that,

1443
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,900
so imagine how they'd react

1444
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,380
if there was a powerful political movement

1445
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,300
to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.

1446
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,940
Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,

1447
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,060
bullying, and discrimination,

1448
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,940
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

1449
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,780
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

1450
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,780
It is my right to raise my child

1451
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,780
with the moral precept that I find

1452
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,700
to be beneficial for my child.

1453
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,860
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

1454
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,980
And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.

1455
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,900
That is insane.

1456
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,860
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

1457
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,260
because he can't handle the debate.

1458
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,340
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

1459
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,580
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

1460
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,300
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

1461
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,140
I now have two choices.

1462
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,300
One is to leave the country utterly.

1463
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,260
Two is to pick up a gun.

1464
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,960
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

1465
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,340
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative whose career requires

1466
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
that he convince his right-wing audience

1467
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,940
that he's one of the good ones.

1468
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,060
This means that he's willing to sit across

1469
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,900
from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,

1470
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,500
and listen to Ben say

1471
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,180
he would never attend his anniversary party

1472
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,340
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

1473
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,980
There's a difference between me just being friends

1474
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,220
with Dave and me actively participating in an event

1475
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,140
that I feel is religiously sinful.

1476
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,740
The two of them then congratulate themselves

1477
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,620
about how they can still be great friends.

1478
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,180
Why is it that we're able to do this

1479
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,540
and most people can't do this?

1480
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,380
That's what I'm curious about.

1481
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,700
Because we go home at night and we can have our own lives.

1482
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,180
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

1483
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,020
with conservative Glenn Beck,

1484
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,860
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

1485
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,900
and then congratulates himself on having the conversation.

1486
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,460
I am a deeply religious man and my religion says

1487
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:01,460
man and a woman, that is the basic building block of family.

1488
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,000
And that's what I believe.

1489
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But I also am, I also know God created you

1490
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,400
just like he created me, flaws and all.

1491
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,800
I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,

1492
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,400
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

1493
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,680
because it runs in my family.

1494
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,800
So does craziness, but it runs in my family.

1495
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,920
Well, Dave smiles and nods,

1496
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,720
probably because he's thinking about

1497
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,200
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

1498
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,960
Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis

1499
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,280
and then we're good because they get it, they get it,

1500
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,040
that's my governor, yeah.

1501
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,920
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

1502
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,240
and they see, finally, a reasonable gay person

1503
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,160
who doesn't scream bigot at everyone who disagrees

1504
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,040
and can actually have a civil conversation.

1505
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,600
But that's not what I see.

1506
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,880
I look at Dave Rubin and I see

1507
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,160
a sublimely bootlicking doormat

1508
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,880
who won't even defend his own family

1509
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,680
from the most fundamental disrespect.

1510
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,520
I also can't help but notice

1511
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,280
that none of these civil conversations

1512
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,640
seem to change anyone's mind.

1513
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,000
Persuasion is more complicated

1514
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,520
and less rational than people think.

1515
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,240
Meghan often says that she was deradicalized on Twitter,

1516
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,360
but if you read her book carefully,

1517
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,160
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

1518
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,880
The major precipitating event for Meghan's crisis of faith

1519
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,840
was her mother's mistreatment

1520
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,520
at the hands of an increasingly

1521
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,880
misogynistic church leadership

1522
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,520
that made Meghan feel like she was the victim

1523
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,840
of the church for once.

1524
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,960
She says of the church discipline,

1525
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,000
for the first time in my life,

1526
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,840
the accused were people I lived with

1527
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,440
and knew most intimately,

1528
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,800
and I knew that the judgments leveled by the elders

1529
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,720
were wrong.

1530
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,320
I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.

1531
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,040
So she finally experienced firsthand

1532
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,640
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

1533
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,360
She stopped voting for the leopards

1534
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,240
eating people's faces party

1535
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,640
only when the leopards ate her face.

1536
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,920
It also seems relevant to notice

1537
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,840
that the people who had calm, civil conversations

1538
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,440
with Meghan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

1539
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,640
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

1540
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,560
They were mostly straight men,

1541
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,840
like director Kevin Smith,

1542
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,240
who started hashtag save Meghan

1543
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,680
because, quote, she's hot.

1544
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,120
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

1545
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,180
and that certainly seems to be the case with Meghan,

1546
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,960
because one of the people who helped deradicalize her

1547
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,720
is now her husband.

1548
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,920
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

1549
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,160
if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion

1550
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,660
in deradicalization experiences.

1551
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,600
I think this experience is usually more akin

1552
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,560
to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.

1553
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,080
There's also a world of difference

1554
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,720
between the mostly private conversations

1555
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,840
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs

1556
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,640
and the spectacle of public debate.

1557
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,080
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

1558
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,720
because he livestreamed a civil conversation

1559
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,000
with Dave Rubin.

1560
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,600
So who is this conversation even for?

1561
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,240
Well, obviously it's for the audience.

1562
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,080
I think these civil conversations

1563
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,340
basically function to reassure a homophobic audience

1564
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:32,460
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

1565
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,020
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

1566
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,420
Look at Ben Shapiro.

1567
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,220
He is friends with a gay.

1568
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,220
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

1569
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,780
of the Overton window,

1570
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,460
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

1571
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,820
So often people who want to promote bigotry

1572
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:52,060
will use debate as a foot in the door.

1573
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,900
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

1574
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,860
are within the realm of reasonable

1575
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,980
and socially accepted opinion.

1576
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,740
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan

1577
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:06,460
in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

1578
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:10,000
without the British public having a proper debate

1579
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,380
about these issues.

1580
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,700
Now why do we need to have a proper debate

1581
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,500
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

1582
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,900
when drag performance has been a staple

1583
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,420
of British entertainment

1584
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,900
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

1585
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,000
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

1586
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1587
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,540
Three little maids from school.

1588
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:34,220
Fishy fishy fishy fish.

1589
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,380
As I am man,

1590
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,660
my state is desperate for my master's love.

1591
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:45,940
As I am woman, now alas the day.

1592
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,120
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

1593
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,660
on their own terms

1594
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,820
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

1595
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,860
It's how they convince the public

1596
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,380
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

1597
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,820
is actually a valid concern

1598
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:05,900
rather than the tedious, small-minded whining about nothing

1599
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,140
that it really is.

1600
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,940
Having the debate on a bigot's terms

1601
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,540
is not a good way to win people over

1602
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,300
unless you're really skilled

1603
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,460
in the art of humiliating people,

1604
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,820
which most of the time

1605
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,680
is what public debate is actually about.

1606
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,340
This is something that J.K. Rowling

1607
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,220
doesn't seem to understand.

1608
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,380
In The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

1609
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,560
Jo Ro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

1610
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,580
She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos

1611
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:38,180
saying that activists are making a strategic error

1612
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,060
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

1613
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,060
making him look dangerous and sexy.

1614
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,020
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

1615
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,940
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

1616
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,420
So is deplatforming a strategic error

1617
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,660
that gives power to your opponent,

1618
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,260
or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

1619
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,700
I find Rowling's conviction

1620
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,980
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

1621
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,240
really out of touch.

1622
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,980
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons

1623
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,140
for the things he does.

1624
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,500
He has strategies for humiliating people.

1625
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,420
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

1626
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,500
being fabulous and doing my hair,

1627
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,860
to prepare a speech for you.

1628
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,260
Well, a few remarks, really.

1629
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,180
Feminism is cancer.

1630
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,540
Thank you very much.

1631
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,580
To again quote Ian Danskin,

1632
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,740
you can't really reason with someone

1633
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,140
who thinks that feminism is cancer

1634
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,300
because you don't reason with cancer.

1635
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,860
You eradicate it.

1636
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,740
Rowling objects to the slogan no debate

1637
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,740
in the strongest possible terms.

1638
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,820
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

1639
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,860
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

1640
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,620
We hear it all the time.

1641
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:49,420
That alarms me, really alarms me.

1642
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,780
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

1643
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,660
than no debate.

1644
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,800
It's kind of amazing to me

1645
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,780
that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter

1646
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,940
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

1647
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,100
I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough

1648
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,460
to be capable of such a perspective.

1649
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,860
Before I move on, I do want to clarify

1650
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,740
that I do think there are trans issues

1651
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,540
that are legitimately debatable

1652
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,340
by people who are not bigots.

1653
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,980
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

1654
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,440
is one of those issues.

1655
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,860
But it's a complicated issue.

1656
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,760
Like first of all, which sport are we talking about?

1657
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,940
Are we talking about figure skating?

1658
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,940
Middle school field hockey?

1659
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,920
I see no reason why trans girls

1660
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,620
should be excluded from that.

1661
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,180
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

1662
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,380
well then it seems plausible

1663
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,060
that trans women who have been through male puberty

1664
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,460
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

1665
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,180
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

1666
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,220
People are transitioning younger now

1667
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,580
and that's another thing you have to consider.

1668
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,460
So I'm not against debating this issue,

1669
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,540
I just want people to approach it

1670
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,500
with nuance and good faith.

1671
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,700
And currently, a lot of the people

1672
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,740
who are vocally against trans women and women's sports

1673
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,140
sound like this.

1674
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,740
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

1675
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,540
How ridiculous.

1676
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,660
That will take place on day one.

1677
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,540
And I don't wanna debate those people.

1678
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,260
I wanna serve them a banana cream pie.

1679
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,700
Chapter six, illiberal methods.

1680
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,600
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints

1681
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,260
about the trans rights movement

1682
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,580
is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.

1683
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,780
So when I first became interested

1684
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:41,060
and then deeply troubled

1685
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:44,260
by what I saw as a cultural movement

1686
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,660
that was illiberal in its methods.

1687
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,180
So what are these illiberal methods?

1688
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:53,860
If you are saying this person is canceled,

1689
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,100
that is the language of a dictator.

1690
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:56,980
It's true.

1691
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,340
Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.

1692
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,420
First they canceled the socialists

1693
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,220
and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.

1694
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,660
But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.

1695
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,780
You know, I can't help but wonder

1696
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,500
what counts as acceptable activist methods

1697
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,740
to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery

1698
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,620
was taking things too far.

1699
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,740
I'm not fighting what I see as a powerful,

1700
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,380
insidious, misogynistic movement.

1701
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,540
I do not see this particular movement

1702
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,580
as either benign or powerless.

1703
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,080
Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement

1704
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,260
is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way

1705
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,440
that makes it different from all past liberation movements.

1706
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,500
But how?

1707
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
What are these illiberal methods

1708
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,480
that distinguish trans rights activism

1709
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,300
from similar past movements?

1710
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,400
Canceling?

1711
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,460
Anita Bryant was way more canceled

1712
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,440
than J.K. Rowling ever will be.

1713
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
Boycotts?

1714
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,080
Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement

1715
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,240
in modern history.

1716
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,360
Disrupting feminist meetings?

1717
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,200
Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.

1718
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,220
Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?

1719
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:23,120
In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique

1720
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,540
and founder of the National Organization for Women

1721
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,640
and Second Wave Feminism in general,

1722
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,900
coined the phrase Lavender Menace

1723
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,660
to describe the threat she believed

1724
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,260
that lesbians posed to the women's movement.

1725
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

1726
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,580
would make it easy to dismiss the movement

1727
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,580
as a bunch of mannish man-haters.

1728
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,500
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

1729
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,220
who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970

1730
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,900
to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,

1731
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,700
a disruptive public protest

1732
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,540
designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.

1733
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,620
Think glitter bombing.

1734
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,740
Think pies.

1735
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,540
Half aggression, half whimsy.

1736
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,260
Like that time the lesbian Avengers

1737
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,100
zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,

1738
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,500
demanding that she resign.

1739
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,540
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

1740
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,060
Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.

1741
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,980
So just as the meeting was beginning,

1742
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,420
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

1743
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,420
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,

1744
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,220
and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.

1745
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,060
Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,

1746
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,020
this conference won't proceed

1747
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,740
until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.

1748
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,900
One of the NOW organizers yelled back,

1749
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,860
I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

1750
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,540
You're acting like men.

1751
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,300
Betty Friedan would later speculate

1752
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,660
that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP

1753
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,140
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

1754
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:46,060
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting

1755
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,880
using illiberal tactics,

1756
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,020
not because they were against feminism,

1757
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,020
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists

1758
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,060
to include them.

1759
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,660
It's the same thing that's happening today

1760
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,240
when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,

1761
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,980
as J.K. Rowling puts it,

1762
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,760
interestingly neglecting to mention

1763
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,740
which feminist meetings these are.

1764
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,060
I was starting to see activists behaving

1765
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,840
in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

1766
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,660
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging

1767
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:14,340
and kicking on windows, very threatening.

1768
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,520
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

1769
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,500
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive

1770
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,280
than similar past movements.

1771
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,420
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man

1772
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,780
called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh who says,

1773
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:29,020
all those gay rights and AIDS protests,

1774
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,340
I don't remember a single one

1775
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,300
where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

1776
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,620
Not a single one.

1777
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,780
Not a single one.

1778
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,460
Not a single one.

1779
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:45,460
Not a single one.

1780
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,140
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS

1781
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,500
to the trans movement.

1782
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,140
And also, quote,

1783
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,580
I will fucking nail you to a wall

1784
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:58,660
what you have done to these innocent children.

1785
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,780
Your mutilation of these little humand

1786
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,780
because they were gay will be nothing

1787
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:08,340
compared to what I will do to you legally.

1788
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,060
You think you are ghouls.

1789
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,840
Wait till I deal with you, bastard, and I mean to.

1790
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,860
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

1791
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,900
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people

1792
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,200
to a wall count as illiberal methods?

1793
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,260
I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so

1794
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,800
because she's never condemned it.

1795
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,420
In fact, when Dennis' Twitter suspension ended,

1796
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,600
she was right there to welcome him back,

1797
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,380
and she continues to retweet him.

1798
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,100
I've always been happy to acknowledge

1799
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,100
that angry trans people on Twitter

1800
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,060
sometimes take things too far.

1801
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,320
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,

1802
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,020
I don't support that, and I've called it out in the past.

1803
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,100
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

1804
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,380
drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,

1805
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:54,860
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

1806
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,660
I called him out, tweeting,

1807
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,140
doing edgy ironic misogyny while defending trans people

1808
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,740
magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say

1809
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,600
about there being misogyny in trans activism.

1810
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,660
I tweeted that because I recognize

1811
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,820
that if people who are claiming to speak for you

1812
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,140
are doing so in a misogynistic way,

1813
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,860
and if you let that slide,

1814
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,060
you're going to wake up one day

1815
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,500
to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.

1816
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,940
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,

1817
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,700
explaining that actually,

1818
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,100
I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

1819
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,420
for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling

1820
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,820
and then he accused me of cancel culturing him

1821
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,820
while at the same time,

1822
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,620
literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

1823
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,540
The more viewer in the replies being like,

1824
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,020
that's not what's happening right here.

1825
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,260
Like this is necessary, okay?

1826
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:45,820
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on that.

1827
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,300
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

1828
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,220
Move you off this site and into,

1829
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,980
I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

1830
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,500
So that pretty much confirms to me

1831
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,900
that Vosh doesn't actually care

1832
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,580
about advocating for trans people

1833
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,940
and just uses trans rights as a pretext

1834
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,380
to act like a fucking dingus.

1835
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,380
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,

1836
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,180
because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

1837
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,620
The point I'm trying to make is,

1838
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:11,980
I have no qualms about calling out people on my side

1839
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,380
whenever they go too far or cross a line

1840
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,580
or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me

1841
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,820
about how I don't understand tactical misogyny, idiot.

1842
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,220
But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.

1843
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,420
I have never once seen her call out

1844
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,540
any of the bigotry and abusiveness

1845
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:30,260
that is absolutely rampant in the gender critical movement.

1846
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,500
There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends

1847
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,380
by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty

1848
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,180
of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists

1849
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,440
versus the abusive trans mob.

1850
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,020
A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling

1851
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,980
accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples

1852
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,060
of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.

1853
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,300
Things like, kill turfs 2014.

1854
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,260
How about slowly and horrendously murder turfs

1855
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:00,180
in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

1856
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,820
Now, I don't think anyone should joke

1857
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,920
about putting people in saw traps,

1858
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,560
but also, how serious is this threat

1859
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,560
that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

1860
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,800
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

1861
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:16,120
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,

1862
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,120
has a Tumblr account and is threatening turfs?

1863
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

1864
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,600
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats

1865
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,960
and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.

1866
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

1867
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,480
I can fill the screen up with examples

1868
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,440
just from people who J.K. Rowling

1869
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,200
has explicitly supported or interacted with.

1870
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,960
I will drive you out into the desert

1871
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,800
and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says,

1872
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,480
from a fan of J.K. Rowling.

1873
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,940
First, I'll set you on fire

1874
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,080
and piss on your half-alive corpse.

1875
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,220
Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

1876
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,760
Another threat from the same user

1877
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,500
is so graphically violent and sexual,

1878
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,480
I don't know if I can even read it aloud

1879
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,040
without violating the YouTube terms of service.

1880
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,560
But threats like this from the gender-critical side

1881
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,200
are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

1882
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,240
Both Rowling and Megan seem happy

1883
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,320
to cherry-pick threatening tweets

1884
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,600
and soundbites of shouting protesters.

1885
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,080
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

1886
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,400
You look like you've got your teeth

1887
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,320
knocked out of your fucking fascist!

1888
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,040
As evidence that the trans movement

1889
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,360
is dangerous and insidious to the core.

1890
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,560
But this exact technique has been used

1891
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,120
against literally every liberation movement in world history.

1892
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,600
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,

1893
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,720
the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

1894
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,200
which first got J.K. Rowling

1895
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,800
interested in feminism in the 1970s.

1896
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,040
Here's how The Guardian,

1897
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,560
Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,

1898
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,920
covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

1899
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,600
Chanting slogans against rape

1900
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,640
seems reasonable to promote awareness,

1901
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,480
but what about the hissing and swearing

1902
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,480
at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?

1903
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,600
We were all sympathetic to the principles

1904
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,480
of the women's liberation movement,

1905
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,840
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women,

1906
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,320
when it became clear that my friend's brother

1907
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,000
was running the risk of personal mutilation

1908
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,360
if he remained with us.

1909
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,480
The protesters were allegedly singing,

1910
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:16,360
here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

1911
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,420
So this is how the British press

1912
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,880
covered the women's movement.

1913
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,760
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming, castrate men!

1914
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,900
Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?

1915
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,500
Should we judge every movement

1916
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,660
by its most militant extremists?

1917
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:34,460
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanas,

1918
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:38,160
who shot Andy Warhol, who advocated for male extermination

1919
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,140
in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,

1920
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,580
is representative of feminism as a whole?

1921
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,980
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

1922
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,220
But it's not fair, is it?

1923
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,100
So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair

1924
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,660
to judge the trans movement

1925
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,220
by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

1926
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:57,420
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

1927
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,860
And I made excuses for you then.

1928
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,900
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

1929
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,140
Meghan interviews New York Times columnist

1930
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:07,580
Michelle Goldberg, who has written sympathetically

1931
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,220
about transphobic feminism.

1932
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,500
There's a moment in this interview

1933
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:13,940
where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation

1934
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,620
that I find fascinating.

1935
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,140
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,

1936
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,140
you know, I'm not gonna debate my basic humanity.

1937
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,420
And part of the difficulty

1938
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,220
is that there are indeed certain issues

1939
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:27,260
which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

1940
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:31,060
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

1941
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:34,060
And I think that part of what is so difficult

1942
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,620
about this issue is that there are certain people

1943
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,660
who think that this kind of consensus

1944
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:42,380
can be imposed maybe as opposed to evolve organically.

1945
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:47,380
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up

1946
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,500
in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

1947
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:55,100
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection

1948
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,420
as other groups whose rights we've decided

1949
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,020
are not up for public conversation.

1950
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:01,860
I think the problem is that

1951
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,500
we don't actually have a consensus.

1952
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,420
So Michelle correctly observes

1953
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,700
that the reason trans people are often reluctant

1954
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,700
to debate our rights is that we want

1955
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,220
the same assumed protections as other groups

1956
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,260
whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.

1957
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:18,180
But then Michelle suggests that trans people

1958
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,140
have to debate our rights

1959
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,820
because there isn't a mainstream consensus

1960
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,220
that we deserve rights.

1961
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,300
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg

1962
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,260
thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.

1963
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,260
Like, does she think that women's suffrage

1964
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:34,380
just evolved organically?

1965
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:38,020
Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations

1966
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:41,060
about whether women are intellectually capable of voting

1967
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:44,220
until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?

1968
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:47,180
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,

1969
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:50,180
sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

1970
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,380
Like, people forget this,

1971
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,420
maybe because they were called suffragettes,

1972
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,900
which is kind of a cutesy name,

1973
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,380
but the suffragettes, they murdered people.

1974
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,260
They were suffragette terrorists.

1975
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:01,820
They broke windows, they bombed churches,

1976
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,820
they set fire to a theater.

1977
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:07,100
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill

1978
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,220
with a horse whip.

1979
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,460
Queen shit, honestly.

1980
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:12,940
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet

1981
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,620
at the Prime Minister's head.

1982
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,860
And my point is not to advocate terrorism

1983
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,540
or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.

1984
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,180
I think these kinds of tactics have tended

1985
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,020
to turn people against the movement.

1986
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,460
I don't think it's effective.

1987
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,660
But let's not pretend that past movements

1988
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,560
have never made demands before everyone was ready.

1989
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,060
Because there never has been,

1990
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:34,000
and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.

1991
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,220
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published

1992
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,540
the Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,

1993
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:43,560
and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

1994
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,420
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,

1995
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,220
and there probably never will be.

1996
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,620
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights

1997
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,380
if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.

1998
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,860
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you

1999
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,220
from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.

2000
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,980
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just

2001
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:03,580
politely persuade everyone to give us rights,

2002
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,220
but the reality is, that's not how this works,

2003
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,380
and it never has been.

2004
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,580
Like, how do these debate me centrists

2005
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:12,300
think that slavery ended in the United States?

2006
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,980
Well, between 1861 and 1865,

2007
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,900
there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.

2008
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,420
See what I'm holding in my hand?

2009
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,500
This is a high-caliber idea

2010
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,660
that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.

2011
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:29,100
Do you people think that American schools were integrated

2012
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,140
because all the white people in the South were persuaded

2013
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,900
that segregation is bad?

2014
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,900
No, dum-dums.

2015
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,320
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne

2016
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,260
to enforce that shit at gunpoint.

2017
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:42,020
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements

2018
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,220
with black civil rights.

2019
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,340
I am aware that being a white queer person

2020
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,020
is not in any way equivalent

2021
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,140
to living in the aftermath of slavery.

2022
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,700
I'm just saying that there's this tendency

2023
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,440
to sanitize history and to imagine

2024
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,980
that progress was smooth and bloodless,

2025
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,960
that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.

2026
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,420
And then people get the impression that current movements

2027
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,140
are somehow more militant than successful past movements

2028
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,380
when they just aren't.

2029
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,940
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

2030
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:15,540
misogynistic movement, a cultural movement

2031
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,940
that was illiberal in its methods.

2032
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:22,940
And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous

2033
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,540
about this movement and it must be challenged.

2034
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,420
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

2035
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:32,080
Chapter seven, why is J.K. Rowling like this?

2036
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:35,700
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,

2037
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,700
whom I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.

2038
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:41,720
I myself favor violence, deeply.

2039
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,200
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,

2040
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,680
which I don't agree with.

2041
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,520
But she was an interesting writer,

2042
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,360
one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head,

2043
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,080
who you can't stop thinking about.

2044
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,320
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right-Wing Women,

2045
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,680
published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly

2046
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,960
and Anita Bryant.

2047
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,300
Right-Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women

2048
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,560
are drawn to conservative politics,

2049
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,920
seemingly against their own interests.

2050
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,880
Anyone who's interested in understanding

2051
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,560
the gender-critical movement,

2052
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,480
a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself

2053
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,040
as feminism, should read this book.

2054
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,440
In Dworkin's analysis,

2055
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,780
the political right makes certain metaphysical

2056
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,740
and material promises to women that both exploit

2057
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,980
and quiet some of women's deepest fears.

2058
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,220
No one can bear to live a meaningless life.

2059
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:35,320
Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.

2060
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,080
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

2061
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,560
The right offers women a simple, fixed,

2062
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:45,200
predetermined social, biological, and sexual order.

2063
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,000
Form conquers chaos.

2064
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,840
Form banishes confusion.

2065
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,240
The gender-critical movement offers women

2066
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,540
a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

2067
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:57,960
A woman is an adult human female.

2068
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,320
Right-wing anti-trans activist Posie Parker

2069
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,600
has made this phrase into the motto

2070
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,480
of the gender-critical movement.

2071
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,760
Adult human female.

2072
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,200
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts,

2073
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,240
it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

2074
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,440
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,

2075
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:21,080
it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

2076
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:24,340
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,

2077
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,600
there can be no change.

2078
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,640
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability

2079
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,160
and chaos that gender-criticals fear.

2080
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,000
The same fear that once drove homophobic women

2081
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,480
like Anita Bryant.

2082
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,560
It's just biologically that God made mothers

2083
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,760
so that we could reproduce.

2084
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:43,800
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

2085
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,160
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability

2086
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,320
of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

2087
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,520
Dworkin says,

2088
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,440
Within the frame of male domination,

2089
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,320
there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,

2090
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,800
both male and female.

2091
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,520
Women are interchangeable as sex objects.

2092
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,280
Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

2093
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,280
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

2094
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,680
Having children is the one social contribution

2095
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,060
credited to women.

2096
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:12,680
It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

2097
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,440
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.

2098
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,920
Homosexuality for women means having nothing,

2099
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,600
it means extinction.

2100
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,180
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality

2101
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,880
and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

2102
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,440
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

2103
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,440
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

2104
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,520
The producer of the large gametes.

2105
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,560
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men

2106
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,840
is the loss of fertility.

2107
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,440
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,

2108
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,680
attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,

2109
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,360
makes women expendable.

2110
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,840
The one thing women can do and be valued for

2111
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,640
will no longer be valued.

2112
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,460
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying

2113
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:01,840
because it suggests a world without women altogether,

2114
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,960
a world in which women are extinct.

2115
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,800
This exact fear appears frequently

2116
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,400
in gender-critical rhetoric.

2117
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,920
Trans activists are erasing women.

2118
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,520
They're erasing biological sex.

2119
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,400
They're going to call us pregnant people.

2120
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,160
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.

2121
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,560
Trans women are going to replace biological women.

2122
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,680
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men

2123
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,520
are aggressively replacing women.

2124
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,400
You will not replace us!

2125
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,920
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession

2126
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,440
and the results can be dazzling.

2127
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,440
In September 2022, Maya Forstater,

2128
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,920
who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist

2129
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,880
whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,

2130
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,120
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage

2131
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,720
because the Hertfordshire County Libraries

2132
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,040
announced they were changing their children's

2133
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:55,640
storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear,

2134
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,040
if you don't know where this is going,

2135
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,720
strap in from the Bookstart Bear

2136
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:04,720
to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.

2137
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,280
Are you enraged?

2138
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,000
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

2139
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,480
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother

2140
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,160
who referred to Talia, wait, wasn't it Tala?

2141
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:21,840
Referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns.

2142
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,880
Describing the mascot as ideological,

2143
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,160
creepy, and gaslighting.

2144
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,920
I cannot express how upset I feel.

2145
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:34,800
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia,

2146
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,440
isn't trans, they are an alien.

2147
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,200
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

2148
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,800
Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?

2149
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,840
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

2150
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,520
There's an advantage in having a character

2151
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,720
that isn't identifiably male or female,

2152
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,000
as it can be equally relatable to either sex

2153
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,200
and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

2154
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,480
But Maya was not convinced.

2155
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,960
It seems highly unlikely that an alien

2156
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,520
that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan

2157
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,480
is not sexually reproducing.

2158
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:08,000
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,

2159
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,400
not a slime mold.

2160
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:15,280
I need to know how the alien fucks right now.

2161
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,200
I said I need to know how the alien fucks

2162
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,640
before I can show it to my child.

2163
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:28,640
When Twitter, understandably, laughed it up

2164
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:32,480
at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.

2165
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,600
And she posted hard.

2166
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,320
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen

2167
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,640
anyone post so hard.

2168
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,880
In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about

2169
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,880
the miseries of new motherhood.

2170
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,680
You are in charge of a baby.

2171
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,280
You have never done this before.

2172
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,440
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months

2173
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,640
and won't for years.

2174
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,640
Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing

2175
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,200
right and wrong, and you've become invisible.

2176
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,640
You had politics.

2177
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,960
You had a career.

2178
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,520
You had interests.

2179
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,960
You had a sex life.

2180
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,520
Now, you have the daily needs

2181
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,360
of a completely dependent person,

2182
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,000
and your world has shrunk.

2183
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,800
The fact that these men and the young women

2184
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,760
that cheer them on think this is so laughable

2185
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,440
reflects society's disdain for mothers.

2186
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,880
This is what it means to say

2187
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,240
a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

2188
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:19,120
This is why the hub of the resistance is on Mumsnet.

2189
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,280
So, I am fascinated by this thread.

2190
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,480
I think it's one of the most revealing texts

2191
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,000
in gender-critical history.

2192
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,400
Because you know what?

2193
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:31,920
Maya Forstater actually does have valid concerns.

2194
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,280
But the concerns she has that are valid

2195
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,480
have nothing to do with trans people.

2196
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,680
And they definitely have nothing to do

2197
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,480
with an adorable cartoon alien.

2198
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:44,880
Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.

2199
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,480
Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?

2200
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,960
I know she has one.

2201
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:53,320
Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?

2202
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:57,040
No one should have to feel this alone, raising children.

2203
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,200
That is a valid concern.

2204
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,840
Oh my God, we actually found one.

2205
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,520
It's like finding El Dorado.

2206
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,240
A valid concern.

2207
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,240
A valid concern.

2208
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,520
Isn't what's going on here

2209
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,680
that Maya is taking legitimate feelings

2210
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:12,440
of being overburdened and underappreciated

2211
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,520
and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?

2212
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,720
This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits,

2213
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,280
by providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.

2214
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,040
It's not your husband's neglect.

2215
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,920
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

2216
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,120
It's not the indignities of aging.

2217
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,680
It's Tala, the non-binary alien,

2218
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,840
with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.

2219
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,520
Mumsnet is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.

2220
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,120
It's too much, these people are too much.

2221
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:44,700
Okay, we have to be serious now.

2222
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:48,940
The political right also promises women safety and security.

2223
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,740
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

2224
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,220
The right acknowledges the reality of danger,

2225
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,700
the validity of fear.

2226
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,780
The right then manipulates the fear.

2227
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,180
Women fear and resent male violence,

2228
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,220
which they're most likely to experience

2229
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,340
from the men closest to them,

2230
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,980
boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

2231
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,740
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

2232
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:13,180
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society

2233
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:16,140
means that women's legitimate fears and resentments

2234
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:19,700
often cannot be directed at the men with power.

2235
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,500
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage

2236
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,100
and contempt they feel for the men who actually abuse them,

2237
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,420
those close to them, and project it onto others,

2238
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,540
those far away, foreign, or different.

2239
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,460
And this displacement of rage

2240
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:38,100
is just transparently what's going on with J.K. Rowling.

2241
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,220
In her essay about sex and gender issues,

2242
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:44,660
Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

2243
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,220
to be the son her father wanted.

2244
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,220
I really felt the rejection of my father,

2245
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,380
and that is one of the things

2246
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:53,220
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

2247
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,500
And she describes the lingering trauma

2248
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,700
from her first violent marriage.

2249
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:00,020
The marriage at this point has turned very violent

2250
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,380
and very controlling.

2251
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:05,180
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out

2252
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:07,940
against the transgender movement.

2253
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,540
If you try to understand this rationally,

2254
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:12,700
it looks like a total non sequitur.

2255
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,660
But if you look at it emotionally,

2256
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,420
there's a kind of logic to it.

2257
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:18,540
The existence of the dangerous outsider

2258
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,860
always functions for women simultaneously

2259
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:24,700
as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.

2260
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,700
Women cling to irrational hatreds

2261
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,220
focused particularly on the unfamiliar

2262
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,180
so that they will not murder their fathers,

2263
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:33,620
husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,

2264
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,500
the men with whom they are intimate,

2265
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,380
those who do hurt them.

2266
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:40,380
In the 1970s, many conservative women

2267
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:43,060
displaced this rage onto lesbians,

2268
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,220
the threatening outsider of the day.

2269
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:49,340
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,

2270
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,220
where she spoke to a lot of women

2271
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,580
about their fear of lesbians.

2272
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:56,380
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians

2273
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,220
as if lesbians were rapists,

2274
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,300
certified committers of sexual assault

2275
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,580
against women and girls.

2276
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:04,940
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,

2277
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:07,980
experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

2278
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:09,940
hovering closer and closer.

2279
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,460
She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching,

2280
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,220
threatening by her very presence a sexual order

2281
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,460
that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.

2282
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:21,340
It's almost surreal to read this

2283
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:24,260
because of how precisely it describes

2284
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,020
how gender-criticals talk about trans women.

2285
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,860
Pronouns are like Rohypnol.

2286
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,340
They dull your defenses.

2287
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,180
They change your inhibitions.

2288
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,100
They're meant to.

2289
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:36,940
Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism

2290
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:41,180
began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,

2291
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:45,700
with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979

2292
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,180
that transsexualism should be morally mandated

2293
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,620
out of existence.

2294
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:51,980
But the gender-critical movement

2295
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,380
was always destined to become a right-wing movement

2296
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,700
because it has the structure of a right-wing movement,

2297
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:01,900
taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men

2298
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,500
and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

2299
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:09,100
The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity

2300
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,020
for conservatives to pass up.

2301
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:12,060
As Dworkin says,

2302
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,380
Because women so displace their rage,

2303
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:17,700
they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

2304
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:21,260
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

2305
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:23,420
The right provides these symbols of danger

2306
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:26,380
by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

2307
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,900
as sources of danger.

2308
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,180
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone

2309
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,540
of conservative party platforms, both in the UK,

2310
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,820
where Lee Anderson,

2311
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:38,940
deputy chair of the Conservative Party,

2312
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,380
predicts that the next election will be won on

2313
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,740
and in the US,

2314
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:47,980
where the ACLU is currently tracking

2315
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:51,620
more than 450 anti-LGBT bills,

2316
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:55,180
including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,

2317
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:59,020
51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans,

2318
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:00,940
29 trans bathroom bans,

2319
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:04,540
and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.

2320
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:07,580
Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric

2321
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,620
to eliminationist extremes

2322
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:12,100
that have most trans people in this country

2323
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,060
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

2324
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:18,140
Transgenderism must be eradicated

2325
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,380
from public life entirely.

2326
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,500
The left is attacking our children,

2327
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,900
pushing sex talk, transgender extremism,

2328
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,380
and noxious politics in our schools.

2329
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,740
We should reject this demonic assault

2330
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,580
on the innocence of our children

2331
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:35,060
and stand fast against leftist efforts

2332
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:37,460
to mutilate their bodies and minds.

2333
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,980
Stop confusing our babies

2334
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,820
with your groomer gender ideologue.

2335
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,420
I will revoke every Biden policy

2336
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,780
promoting the chemical castration

2337
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:52,540
and sexual mutilization of our youth.

2338
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:57,300
And ask Congress to send me a bill

2339
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:01,180
prohibiting child sexual mutilation

2340
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,900
in all 50 states.

2341
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:07,340
On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies

2342
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:10,220
on so-called gender-affirming care.

2343
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,140
Ridiculous.

2344
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:13,100
I will sign a new executive order

2345
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:15,100
instructing every federal agency

2346
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,100
to cease all programs

2347
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:19,340
that promote the concept of sex

2348
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,100
and gender transition at any age.

2349
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:25,340
A few gender-criticals still want to insist

2350
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,900
they have nothing to do

2351
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,180
with right-wing anti-trans bigots,

2352
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,340
like Helen Lewis.

2353
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,020
I mean, TERF is basically which.

2354
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,540
Who attempts in her interview

2355
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,540
in The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling

2356
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:38,700
to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right

2357
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,420
and that of feminists.

2358
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,580
I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand

2359
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,060
is that there are two different arguments going on.

2360
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:48,340
One is the traditional conservative right argument,

2361
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:50,060
which is anti-LGBT.

2362
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:52,500
The other one is a criticism from the left

2363
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,260
in which it says,

2364
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,900
sometimes male people and female people

2365
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,540
have different interests,

2366
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,700
no matter how the male people identify.

2367
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:03,220
But as a trans person, I don't care

2368
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,100
whether you justify your transphobia

2369
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,580
in the name of protecting women or protecting children.

2370
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,900
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond

2371
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,500
calling for transsexualism

2372
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,260
to be morally mandated out of existence,

2373
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,660
or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles

2374
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,260
calling for transgenderism

2375
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,380
to be eradicated from public life,

2376
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:23,940
is the same repulsive bigotry to me.

2377
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,700
And in any case, the gender critical movement

2378
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:29,820
has recently reached an implicit consensus

2379
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:32,820
that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.

2380
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:35,580
The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker,

2381
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:38,020
aka Kelly J. Keene-Menschel,

2382
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:40,140
rejects feminism entirely.

2383
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,060
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

2384
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:42,900
No.

2385
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,740
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

2386
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:45,420
I probably did for a short time.

2387
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:46,660
But so you wouldn't be said

2388
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,740
like a Julie Bindle type feminist?

2389
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:49,900
No, well, some feminists,

2390
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,380
I mean, Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers

2391
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:55,700
in the past, and I think that's a theme

2392
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,940
flowing through feminism.

2393
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,460
I'm not a feminist!

2394
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,740
I'm not a feminist!

2395
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:02,260
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

2396
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,980
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

2397
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:05,980
Parker's campaign is currently funded

2398
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,620
by the right-wing CPAC.

2399
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:10,820
CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events

2400
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:15,140
and cover all of our insurance throughout our whole trip,

2401
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,500
which is really kind of them.

2402
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,940
But what we would need to do

2403
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:21,340
is we would need to show that we were working for them,

2404
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,860
working with them.

2405
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:24,940
She has no qualms about collaborating

2406
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:26,940
with far-right white nationalists.

2407
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,340
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

2408
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,820
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

2409
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:35,660
She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.

2410
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:38,740
She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.

2411
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:42,220
Why are we enabling children

2412
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:47,220
to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful

2413
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:49,340
or access to abortion?

2414
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:54,540
I think that we really need to rethink all of this.

2415
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,220
I think parents need to take back control of their children.

2416
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,180
She's called trans people fools and perverts.

2417
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:03,220
Transgenderism is nuts.

2418
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,460
It's for fools and perverts.

2419
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,940
She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.

2420
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:10,420
It's not a real thing.

2421
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:12,780
There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.

2422
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,260
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

2423
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:16,420
There's no such thing as a trans person.

2424
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,420
There is no such thing.

2425
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:20,300
There are people that call themselves these things

2426
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:23,580
that may have other issues manifesting

2427
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,660
that then make them think they're this, but no.

2428
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:28,460
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

2429
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,180
There may be more words that we have to say

2430
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,100
in order to say that.

2431
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,460
We may call it transgender ideology,

2432
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:35,980
but when it comes to a person,

2433
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,460
they may be following transgender ideology,

2434
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,020
but they are not transgender.

2435
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:42,540
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

2436
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,740
being anything other than a man or a woman.

2437
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:47,260
She's called trans women pedophiles.

2438
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,700
We know that if a man has a paraphilia

2439
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,380
of dressing as a woman,

2440
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:56,020
the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.

2441
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:59,900
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

2442
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,540
They don't ever stop at one.

2443
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,500
She's said that each and every woman

2444
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,740
who stands in her way will be annihilated.

2445
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,380
Each and every one of you women who stand in my way,

2446
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,860
each and every one of you,

2447
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:14,660
let me just tell you, you will be annihilated.

2448
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,780
She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms

2449
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:22,380
to attack anyone they perceive as not a real woman.

2450
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:26,340
And men, for once, I'm talking to you.

2451
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:32,620
I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry,

2452
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,540
I think that's what you say.

2453
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:36,460
I'm so done with the American lingo.

2454
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:38,900
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

2455
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:41,740
Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.

2456
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:44,260
Maybe you're that sort of man.

2457
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:47,220
Maybe you have a sister or a mother or a wife.

2458
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:49,300
Maybe you have a sister, maybe you just have some friends.

2459
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,940
Maybe you just think women are human

2460
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:55,380
and you don't need any absolute connection with them

2461
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:57,940
to feel compelled to protect us.

2462
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,660
I think you should start using women's toilets, men.

2463
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:06,180
And she's said that women who call themselves men

2464
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,900
should be sterilized,

2465
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,340
which seems to be a little bit in tension

2466
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,500
with J.K. Rowling's concern

2467
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,380
about the fertility of confused girls.

2468
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:18,100
You know, you might look at these differences of opinion

2469
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:19,780
between Rowling and Parker,

2470
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:23,660
little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist,

2471
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,620
left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,

2472
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:30,300
concern about trans men's fertility

2473
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:34,420
versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men,

2474
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:37,380
against annihilating women who stand in your way

2475
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:42,140
versus pro-annihilating each and every woman

2476
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,820
who stands in your way.

2477
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,180
You might look at these differences

2478
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:48,100
and expect that these two women would be at odds,

2479
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,100
but they aren't.

2480
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:53,020
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause

2481
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,220
that for both of them trumps all else.

2482
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,980
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster

2483
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:01,140
reading I heart J.K. Rowling

2484
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:03,940
to be displayed at a railway station in Edinburgh.

2485
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:07,700
And Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times

2486
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,980
and has modeled her t-shirts.

2487
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,820
So the gender critical movement

2488
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:16,140
started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s

2489
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:20,300
has finally passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns,

2490
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,820
as gender critical lesbian, Julie Bindle,

2491
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:24,540
memorably described them.

2492
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,860
It's a movement that has no beliefs

2493
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,140
apart from a shared determination

2494
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:31,540
to reduce the number of trans people.

2495
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,180
In the numbers we're currently seeing,

2496
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:36,020
particularly of young people coming forward,

2497
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,660
I find cause for doubt.

2498
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,020
In the meantime,

2499
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:41,580
while we're trying to get through to the decision makers,

2500
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:43,900
we have to try to limit the harm.

2501
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,500
And that means reducing or keeping down

2502
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,900
the number of people who transition.

2503
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:50,020
And that's for two reasons.

2504
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,940
One of them is that every one of those people

2505
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:54,180
is a person who's been damaged.

2506
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:56,900
But the second one is every one of those people

2507
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:01,900
is basically, you know, a huge problem to a sane world.

2508
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,820
Like if you've got people,

2509
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:04,780
whether they're transitioned,

2510
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:05,900
whether they're happily transitioned,

2511
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,140
whether they're unhappily transitioned,

2512
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,780
whether they're de-transitioned,

2513
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:10,420
if you've got people who've dissociated

2514
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:12,780
from their sex in some way,

2515
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,740
every one of those people

2516
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:16,140
is someone who needs special accommodation

2517
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:19,980
in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of sex.

2518
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,700
So to wrap this up,

2519
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:25,340
is the backlash against J.K. Rowling a witch hunt?

2520
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,020
Unequivocally, no.

2521
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,340
It's very thoroughly deserved.

2522
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,740
But I will say this,

2523
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,500
a movement can't get along without a devil.

2524
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,900
And across the whole political spectrum,

2525
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:41,220
there's a misogynistic tendency to choose a female devil,

2526
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:44,220
whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton,

2527
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:49,220
Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or J.K. Rowling.

2528
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:50,820
And there's always gonna be people

2529
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:54,300
who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.

2530
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:57,980
So I would advise trans people and our allies

2531
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:00,540
to keep in mind that J.K. Rowling

2532
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:03,500
is not the final boss of transphobia.

2533
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:05,100
She's not our devil.

2534
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:08,940
The devil is the Republican Party, the conservative party.

2535
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,940
The devil is patriarchy.

2536
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:13,460
It's the right-wing men who will be the ones

2537
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,220
to put gender-critical theory into brutal practice.

2538
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:21,300
Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and J.K. Rowling are,

2539
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,460
to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.

2540
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,220
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

2541
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:29,820
They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face

2542
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,700
on the patriarchal violence against trans people

2543
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:35,900
that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.

2544
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:40,340
I call on men to consider themselves decent human beings

2545
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:42,780
to call out the deviants among them

2546
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:46,780
and eradicate these monsters from society.

2547
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:50,820
And Megan Phelps Roper and Centra Slayker are wrong

2548
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:54,100
that civil conversation can resolve this.

2549
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,340
Call out the deviants among them

2550
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:00,420
and eradicate these monsters from society.

2551
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:03,540
People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis

2552
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,540
and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.

2553
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,580
They have to be defeated.

2554
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,300
As for what to do about J.K. Rowling,

2555
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:14,300
honestly, let's all just block her.

2556
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:16,820
Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile,

2557
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:18,140
and just block her.

2558
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:19,340
Problem solved.

2559
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,500
Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.

2560
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,100
But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.

2561
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:27,060
She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.

2562
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,740
The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave.

2563
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:32,820
For the same reasons that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.

2564
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:35,100
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

2565
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:38,140
One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam

2566
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:40,700
is that the victims who invested the most

2567
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:43,020
are often the most passionate defenders

2568
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:46,380
because shame is a powerful force in the human psyche

2569
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,420
and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.

2570
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,020
Reformed bigots have to face

2571
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,220
not only the shame of being dupes,

2572
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:55,860
but also the guilt of having devoted years of life

2573
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,660
to harming vulnerable people.

2574
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:00,820
This is something Megan, to her credit, phased head on.

2575
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:04,020
If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life

2576
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:07,340
industriously sowing doom, discord, and rage

2577
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:11,700
to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.

2578
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:13,980
I had wasted my life only to fill others

2579
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,780
with pain and misery.

2580
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:19,860
Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.

2581
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:22,540
It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linehan,

2582
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,620
whose all-consuming hatred of trans people

2583
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:27,180
has ruined his life, cost him his marriage,

2584
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,060
and left him alone to tweet about

2585
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:31,940
destroying gender ideology minutes before midnight

2586
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:35,100
on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled

2587
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,320
to insist with ever more certainty

2588
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,140
that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,

2589
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:42,300
but are all demonic perverts,

2590
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,620
and enemies so hyperbolically evil

2591
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:47,420
that they justify his self-immolating crusade.

2592
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,700
They took everything from me, you know.

2593
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:56,060
They took my family, you know?

2594
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:57,580
And I just said, no, hang on a sec.

2595
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,740
Stop calling these women TERFs.

2596
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:02,660
Stop sending them abuse.

2597
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,020
Let them speak.

2598
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:07,340
And for that, they just destroyed me.

2599
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,860
Do you honestly feel destroyed?

2600
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:12,020
No, because the one thing about this,

2601
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:14,380
the one thing about this that keeps me going

2602
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:16,820
is that I know I'm right, you know?

2603
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,700
I know I'm right.

2604
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:20,980
As long as he stays here in the bottom of the whirlpool,

2605
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:23,740
he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships

2606
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:27,620
and wasted years of life because he just couldn't let it go.

2607
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:30,380
And if J.K. Rowling doesn't log off soon,

2608
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:32,620
this will likely be her fate as well.

2609
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,460
I guess what I'm really trying to say is,

2610
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:38,460
Harry Potter's dead to me.

2611
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,460
I'm switching to Twilight.
