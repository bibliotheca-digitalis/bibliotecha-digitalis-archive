0	5000	Sar, I'm gonna talk about Joe Roe once again.
5360	8360	But first, story time.
9400	11680	Chapter one, Anita.
12880	15800	The most famous bigot in American LGBT history
15800	18240	is a woman called Anita Bryant.
18240	20120	This is her story.
22080	25540	1977 was not a good time to be gay.
25540	27920	Is it ever really a good time to be gay?
27920	32920	In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights
33740	35240	into national consciousness.
35240	38060	The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,
38060	41320	and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association
41320	44100	declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.
44100	46940	But only after gay activists disrupted their conference
46940	50380	and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.
50380	54940	We have abnormal urges, and we will not be silenced.
54940	57960	Because that's the only way to get anything done
57960	60420	in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.
60420	61660	They give you no choice.
61660	65740	On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,
65740	68640	known for such popular cities as Miami,
68640	70600	approved a law that added the phrase
70600	73020	affectional or sexual preference
73020	75000	to its nondiscrimination ordinance,
75000	77940	effectively banning housing and employment discrimination
77940	80000	on the basis of sexual orientation.
80000	84000	And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,
84020	86900	that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.
86900	90220	Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!
90220	92140	Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman
92140	94900	who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,
94900	97700	and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.
97700	101220	♪ Come to the Florida sunshine tree ♪
101220	104020	My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida
104020	105180	any time of day.
105180	106740	Orange juice from Florida!
106740	108900	It isn't just for breakfast anymore!
108900	112340	♪ Orange juice with natural vitamin C ♪
112360	115840	♪ From the Florida sunshine tree ♪
115840	118640	She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,
118640	122040	A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.
122040	123480	Breakfast without orange juice
123480	125600	is like a day without sunshine.
125600	126440	Cute.
126440	128120	When Anita heard her pastor speak
128120	130120	about this nondiscrimination ordinance,
130120	133680	she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.
133680	134520	How touching.
134520	135960	According to the word of God,
135960	139960	it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.
139980	143020	As a mother, she would not stand for this.
143020	146100	So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner, saying,
146100	148300	As a concerned mother of four children,
148300	151380	I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.
151380	153420	I have never condoned nor taught my children
153420	155320	discrimination against anyone.
155320	158380	But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,
158380	161820	you will, in fact, be infringing upon my rights
161820	164760	and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother
164760	166780	to teach my children God's moral code
166780	168660	as stated in the holy scriptures.
168660	170960	Anita, kill your shitty child.
170960	172440	When the amendment passed,
172440	174840	Anita created a campaign for its repeal,
174840	177760	the Save Our Children Coalition,
177760	179800	which sponsored provocative TV ads
179800	182040	implying that gay people are degenerates
182040	184920	who ruin communities and seduce children.
184920	186600	The campaign has been vicious.
186600	187880	With television commercials,
187880	189760	the Save Our Children group is appealing
189760	191560	to parental anxieties,
191560	194000	saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality
194000	195800	before impressionable children.
195800	197220	The Orange Bowl Parade,
197220	200620	Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.
200620	203900	But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,
203900	205740	it's a parade of homosexuals,
205740	208700	men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.
208700	212140	Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash
212140	214220	to gay rights in the United States,
214220	217140	escalating the conflict into a national controversy.
217140	219740	On one side were the gay rights activists
219740	221180	who argued that non-discrimination
221180	222860	was a matter of human rights.
222860	225540	On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued
226280	227120	that the non-discrimination ordinance
227120	230680	would give special privileges to homosexuals.
230680	232040	We all believe in human rights,
232040	234800	but we don't believe human rights
234800	236480	that would corrupt our children
236480	239600	or for individuals to have special privileges
239600	241840	that would go against the constitutional rights
241840	243120	of normal America.
243120	245240	As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,
245240	247080	they have equal rights the same as anyone else.
247080	249880	In other words, gay people already have equal rights,
249880	252120	just as long as they stay in the closet
252120	253840	and don't do anything gay.
253860	255980	That's very helpful.
255980	258500	Thank you so much, Anita,
258500	263500	for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.
263940	265700	As long as they do their job
265700	267140	and do not want to come out of the closet
267140	269820	and force their homosexuality on me
269820	272220	in the areas of business or in the schools,
272220	274100	they can live their life,
274100	276300	and we're not going out after their jobs
276300	279060	or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.
279060	282620	Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals
282620	286440	to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.
286440	288520	Just biologically, that God made mothers
288520	289720	so that we could reproduce.
289720	293080	Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,
293080	296720	but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.
296720	299240	It's the exact same argument that's being used today
299240	300520	by right-wing politicians
300520	303040	who claim that queer people are groomers.
303040	305520	Stop confusing our babies
305520	309160	with your groomer gender ideologue.
309160	312600	This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.
312600	316420	Sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books,
316420	317980	and she believes in traditional marriage
317980	319060	between a man and a woman,
319060	321020	and in that book, it talked about two moms.
321020	324500	Stay away from the children creep, or you will regret it.
324500	325820	People should definitely arm themselves.
325820	326660	I agree with that.
326660	328620	The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.
328620	331900	The Democrats are the party of teachers,
331900	333180	elementary school teachers,
333180	337260	trying to transition their elementary school-age children
337260	339300	and convince them they're a different gender.
339300	342380	They're just evil people, and they want to groom kids.
342960	343800	They're recruiting.
343800	345040	If you don't know what furries are,
345040	348960	it's where school children dress up as animals,
348960	352520	cats or dogs, during the school day.
352520	353920	They meow and they bark.
353920	356160	What a great country we live in.
356160	359040	I love it so much.
359040	360360	Gay people around the country
360360	363280	rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.
363280	366120	There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,
366120	369080	with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu
369080	371080	and replacing them with an apple juice
371100	374020	and vodka cocktail called Anita Bryant.
374020	376060	Let's make one now.
376060	377180	Forgot my cocktail measure,
377180	379660	so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.
379660	381460	Just a dash of apple juice.
381460	382860	Give it a stir.
385260	386420	Needs a garnish.
388420	389260	Stunning.
389260	390780	I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,
390780	392780	but if I was in the 70s,
392780	394940	I would've thrown back so many of these goddamn things
394940	396620	out of pure spite.
396620	398300	There's a story that Troy Perry,
398300	399860	the founder of the gay-affirming
399880	401800	Metropolitan Community Church,
401800	403840	was on a transcontinental flight,
403840	405680	and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice
405680	406920	on his tray, he said,
406920	409760	take that away, I'm a homosexual.
409760	413240	At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,
413240	415880	anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently
415880	418080	on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.
418080	420320	Anita Bryant sucks oranges.
420320	423800	A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.
423800	424640	True.
424640	426480	And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired
426480	428400	more anti-gay legislation,
428400	431460	including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,
431460	433600	both of which passed in the Florida Senate,
433600	436640	as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,
436640	439880	which would've forced public schools to fire gay teachers.
439880	441980	So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.
441980	443940	She was an influential bigot.
443940	446040	But she may also have helped to unify
446040	448080	and galvanize gay activists
448080	450200	by providing them with a common enemy.
450200	452400	According to historian Lillian Federman,
452400	454880	Anita Bryant created fervent activists
454880	456820	out of those who'd previously been content
456820	459260	simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.
459260	461620	Federman cites Eric Hoffer's observation
461620	464780	that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,
464780	467060	but it won't get along at all without a devil.
467060	469020	For gay people all over the country,
469020	471460	Anita Bryant became that devil.
471460	474660	I think that she is rallying the community together
474660	476180	like I have never seen before.
476180	477980	There's no way I could've done it on my own.
477980	480620	So even though she succeeded in her initial goal
480620	482900	to repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance,
482900	485380	there is no question that in the long term,
485380	487220	Anita Bryant was the loser.
487220	488740	She took a lot of Ls.
488740	489580	Rip.
489580	490780	That must be super hard for her.
490780	492780	For the short remainder of her career,
492780	495140	gay activists protested her events,
495140	496860	they shut down the tour for her book
496860	499980	about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,
499980	502280	and they succeeded in turning public opinion
502280	504220	against Anita Bryant to the point
504220	506380	that she became virtually unemployable
506380	507940	in mainstream entertainment.
507940	509380	And a help that she came across
509380	511180	as kind of a judgmental prude
511180	512900	that even hip straight people
512900	515100	didn't want to be associated with.
515100	516700	Our top story tonight,
516700	519180	Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress
519180	521060	and orange juice promoter,
521060	523500	performed coitus in public yesterday
523500	526980	and started a campaign to promote heterosexuality.
526980	529900	We don't serve orange juice anymore.
529900	531980	Like she famously told Playboy magazine.
531980	534380	Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?
534380	535980	It's because they eat the forbidden fruit
535980	537220	of the tree of life.
537220	539100	God referred to men as trees
539100	541700	and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,
541700	542980	which is male sperm.
542980	544300	Oh my God.
544300	546740	Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.
546740	548460	This is how you lose the culture war.
548460	552860	♪ So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita ♪
552860	555660	♪ That's the energy we're surrounded by ♪
555660	558220	And of course, there was the famous incident
558220	561020	where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie
561020	563420	in Anita's face during a TV appearance.
563420	565700	And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia
565700	570220	and were met with protest and all kinds of problems.
570220	572060	And every-
572100	572940	Oh!
574340	575660	Security agents, security agents.
575660	576660	No, no, let him stay.
576660	578180	No. Let him stay.
578180	580060	Well, at least it's a fruit pie.
580060	582060	Miami-Dade County finally reinstated
582060	584740	the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998
584740	588260	and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.
588260	592660	In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face
592660	596220	when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,
596220	597900	announcing her marriage to a woman
597900	600940	and publicly struggling with whether to even invite
600940	602620	her grandmother to the ceremony.
602620	606220	It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that
606220	608180	like an integral part of your identity
608180	611540	is just an evil delusion.
612420	613620	That it is, Sarah.
613620	615420	That it is.
615420	617300	So that's the story of Anita Bryant
617300	619820	as students of LGBT history know it.
619820	622260	But isn't it a bit one-sided?
622260	625660	Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?
625660	629700	The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.
629700	632420	Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.
632420	633740	A plague on both their houses.
633740	637020	Isn't it cruel even to slur Anita
637020	639060	as a bigot and a homophobe?
639060	642340	In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant
642340	645380	was the real victim?
647780	648700	Oh no.
648700	649540	Oh no!
653300	654380	I can't do this anymore.
654380	655220	I'm eating my pie.
655220	656580	I'm eating my goddamn pie.
656580	659980	Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.
659980	660820	God help us all.
661940	664180	The mainstream media would have us believe
664180	666940	that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,
666940	669060	some kind of hateful bigot.
669060	671340	But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic
671340	673860	used to silence valid concerns?
673860	676700	Mothers in this country are worried about their children
676700	679460	going to school to be taught by perverts.
679460	682380	How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals
682380	684580	weren't the real bigots?
684580	686860	Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant
686860	689300	was the first victim of cancel culture,
689300	692940	of, dare I say it, wokeism?
692940	695140	Well, no, that's the dumbest thing
695140	696700	I've ever heard in my entire life.
696700	698340	But suppose that you're an idiot,
698340	701020	and suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.
701020	702940	Well, what would be your argument?
702940	704500	I mean, if someone put a gun to my head
704500	706460	and forced me to make that argument,
706460	708900	I'd probably say something like this.
708900	711700	Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.
711700	714500	In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty
714500	716060	in rural Oklahoma.
716060	718660	Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,
718660	720620	the same year she made her singing debut
720620	722380	at the Baptist Church.
722380	723620	Parts of my childhood,
723620	725700	I blocked out because it hurts too much.
725700	728060	I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,
728060	729460	and my parents were remarried,
729460	731380	and I was baptized and came to know Christ
731380	732940	as my personal savior.
732940	736100	Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.
736100	737620	It was real painful,
737620	739460	and it just about killed my mother.
739460	741500	She was a very submissive wife.
741500	744260	She was too submissive, and it angered me.
745020	746540	She let my dad step all over her.
746540	748940	Because of him, I think I went through life
748940	750940	for a long time hating all men.
750940	754340	Anita described her most intense adolescent memory
754340	756700	as a feeling of intense ambition.
756700	758220	A relentless drive to succeed
758220	760180	at doing well the thing I loved.
760180	765180	♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪
765220	769580	♪ His truth is marching on ♪
769580	771900	But Anita's ambition conflicted
771940	773340	with her submissive role
773340	775700	as a traditional Christian woman.
775700	778540	In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,
778540	780180	Miami's top disc jockey,
780180	783300	with only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.
783300	785300	This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.
785300	786140	Yeah.
789020	792180	Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.
792180	794220	Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,
794220	796500	Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty
796500	799220	nearly unmatched in modern love stories.
799220	801940	And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,
801940	805100	Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.
805100	807020	But while submitting to her husband
807020	808980	and raising four children,
808980	811020	Anita was still able to build the career
811020	812220	she'd always wanted.
812220	815660	By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,
815660	817820	earning half a million dollars a year,
817820	819100	enough to move her family
819100	822900	into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.
822900	826340	So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.
826340	828860	Did she really deserve to lose it all?
829500	831300	Just because she took a stand
831300	833140	for something she believed in?
833140	834900	Anita Bryant's role as a leader
834900	836940	in the campaign against homosexuals
836940	839500	may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice.
839500	841140	Are you being blackballed?
841140	843660	Well, it looks that way.
843660	844940	It's worse than that.
844940	845820	We're being threatened,
845820	848020	and there's all kinds of harassment,
848020	849660	even with my job with Florida Citrus.
849660	853260	I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother
853260	856340	to defend her children and all children
856340	859100	against their being recruited by homosexuals.
859100	861740	Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.
861740	864380	She'd been dropped as spokesperson by the orange growers.
864380	865740	She had been dropped as a commentator
865740	867460	on the Orange Bowl parade.
867460	869460	She lost a television show contract.
869460	871220	Her bookings dropped drastically.
871220	874220	It destroys the dream that I have had since I was a child
874220	876540	to entertain and present wholesome subjects
876540	878420	to my fellow Americans
878420	882220	because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.
882220	884940	No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant
884940	887260	for taking a public stand on something she believed in.
887260	891580	I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house
891580	893740	in a fetal position and wanting to die.
893740	895820	Gay activists in the 1970s
895820	897700	didn't exactly limit their tactics
897700	900860	to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.
900860	902660	Stop Anita now!
902660	904460	Stop Anita now!
904460	905300	Stop Anita now!
905300	907460	Homosexuals started fighting back.
907460	908980	The gays formed new groups
908980	911420	and picketed the performers' public appearances,
911420	913100	forcing her to cancel a few.
913100	916700	Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.
916700	919620	They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.
919620	921500	They blamed her for hate crimes.
921500	923220	They burned her in effigy.
923220	925740	They disrupted events she was involved in.
925740	928380	They printed toilet paper with her face on it.
928380	930260	Some sent Anita death threats.
930260	932180	Or they mailed her rotting oranges,
932180	935020	dead cockroaches, human excrement.
935020	937620	See, this is how you canceled people before phones.
937620	938980	Instead of shitposting,
938980	941660	you would simply mail actual human shit
941660	943420	through the United States Postal Service.
943420	946980	Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night.
946980	949300	Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.
949300	951580	How would you men feel if you opened a letter
951580	953380	and there was a photo of your wife's head
953380	955980	superimposed on some other female nude body
955980	959500	in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?
959500	960540	I can imagine quite a lot.
960540	962060	I do think it would be fair to say
962060	965660	that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.
965660	968060	Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,
968060	970100	particularly lesbian feminists,
970100	972700	abhorred the sexist terms that were being used
972700	974420	to characterize Anita Bryant.
974420	976620	Bitch and whore, gay men called her.
976620	978640	The harassment escalated to the point
978640	980900	where Anita had to cancel her book tour
980900	984660	due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.
984660	986780	And of course, there was the pie.
986780	988420	Oh!
988420	990980	So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.
990980	991820	It's kind of a deep cut.
991820	993820	Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.
993820	996940	Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,
996940	999300	but what about Anita's right to free speech?
999300	1001660	I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.
1001660	1005140	Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book
1005140	1007380	Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee
1007380	1009820	that the orange shoes boycott reminded him
1009820	1012820	of a little thing called McCarthyism.
1012820	1015440	Have you ever considered that being pro-gay
1015440	1017940	is quite similar to being anti-gay
1017940	1020060	in that both are opinions?
1020060	1023400	As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God
1023400	1026960	were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.
1026960	1029360	The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,
1029360	1031400	religious and civic leaders in opposition
1031400	1033800	to a well-organized, highly financed,
1033800	1037160	and politically militant group of homosexual activists.
1037160	1041000	We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,
1041000	1043320	and deniers of basic human rights.
1043320	1046440	And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned
1046440	1048200	for our children and our community.
1048200	1050960	So Anita's version of the story is that she
1050960	1054440	and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers
1054440	1058160	were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia
1058160	1060760	of gay extremists all because they had
1060760	1065240	a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual
1065240	1066880	cavorting with little boys.
1066880	1068320	Cavorting with little boys.
1068320	1071320	Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?
1071320	1073120	Until the Dade County Ordinance,
1073120	1075080	Anita was a registered Democrat
1075080	1077200	and considered herself a liberal.
1077200	1079440	And she never said that she hated gay people
1079440	1080840	or wanted them dead.
1080840	1084800	In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.
1084800	1087960	I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.
1087960	1090120	I love them enough to tell them the truth
1090120	1092680	because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals
1092680	1096680	that if they're willing to turn from sin
1096680	1098360	the same as any individual,
1098360	1100760	that they can be ex-homosexuals
1100760	1102320	the same as there can be an ex-murderer,
1102320	1103880	an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.
1103880	1108280	She loves homosexuals because they can change.
1108280	1110120	Just like murderers.
1110120	1113280	Would a bigot have said that?
1113280	1114880	Just about McFuckin' had it.
1114880	1116680	Anita was so kind-hearted,
1116680	1120200	she even said that she related to the homosexual.
1120200	1122000	I can relate to the homosexual
1122000	1124880	because I've had emotional scars in my own life.
1124880	1126880	I really felt the rejection of my father
1126880	1128040	and that is one of the things
1128040	1131080	that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.
1131080	1134180	Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,
1134180	1136100	no matter what they think of my motives.
1136100	1137480	I've always said I love the sinner
1137480	1138600	but I hate the sin.
1138600	1141240	Wow, what an empath.
1141240	1143120	You know, I actually think it's really noble
1143120	1146340	how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage
1146340	1147760	onto the marginalized group
1147760	1150520	whose rights she's trying to take away.
1150520	1152880	Okay, so we've given a fair hearing
1152880	1154760	to both sides, to many sides.
1154760	1156880	We've considered all the evidence.
1156880	1160160	Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head
1160160	1163840	and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve
1163840	1165320	that pie to the face?
1165320	1168160	Well, yes, obviously.
1168160	1169760	Look, the point I'm trying to make here
1169760	1172600	is that it's possible to take genuine virtues
1172600	1175680	like nuance, empathy, and impartiality
1175680	1178800	and to twist them into fucked up apologia
1178800	1180920	for horrible oppressive behavior.
1180920	1182640	If you play this game long enough,
1182640	1184380	you can essentially explain away
1184380	1186400	the entire concept of bigotry
1186400	1189760	and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.
1189760	1192240	There's only tragically misunderstood people
1192240	1195440	with difficult childhoods and valid concerns
1195440	1198800	cruelly demonized by militant activists
1198800	1200880	defaming and silencing them
1200880	1204960	with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.
1204960	1207800	Now, because you, viewers,
1207800	1210280	are smart, media-literate people,
1210280	1213400	you understand framing, so you already know
1213400	1216900	that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.
1216900	1220800	In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling, ugh.
1220800	1224200	J.K. Rowling is a popular author
1224200	1227720	who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,
1227720	1230880	but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers
1230880	1232720	masturbating into stolen panties
1232720	1235040	because she's lost her goddamn mind.
1235040	1237040	Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.
1237040	1239240	Christ, what a nightmare.
1240080	1244360	Chapter three, the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
1244360	1247600	All right, kids, it's transcend time.
1247600	1250600	Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast
1251400	1254280	about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,
1254280	1257440	an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church,
1257440	1260320	the notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,
1260320	1263660	most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers
1263660	1266920	with signs that say, God hates f**ks.
1266920	1269880	God and me both, I'm tired of you people.
1269880	1272760	J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church
1272760	1276080	is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups
1276080	1277000	in the world.
1277000	1281000	In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.
1281000	1283760	I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.
1283760	1286480	I went to a counter protest in 2010.
1286480	1288440	I remember how when I was in high school,
1288440	1291240	the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing
1291240	1293920	that conservatives and liberals could agree on
1293920	1297280	because they hated the troops and the gays,
1297280	1300600	essentially the two genders of 2006.
1300600	1301440	But let's not pretend
1301440	1303800	that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.
1303800	1305760	Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,
1305760	1309080	she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies
1309080	1311040	about how the gays are going to hell,
1311040	1314440	which to this day, I am a big fan of.
1314440	1318040	♪ But what did you say, you think God loves your brain? ♪
1318040	1321560	♪ He hates all you do because you love fornicating. ♪

1340160	1343680	Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012
1343680	1346480	after a crisis of faith precipitated
1346480	1349080	by a power struggle within the church.
1349080	1352000	She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,
1352000	1354400	which is honestly a pretty interesting account
1354400	1357160	of deconversion and the circumstances
1357160	1359640	that lead someone to leaving a hate group.
1359640	1362080	Megan contacted me for her podcast
1362120	1364640	because I had criticized JK Rowling
1364640	1366680	in a video a couple years ago.
1366680	1367720	Now you may be wondering,
1367720	1370360	why would I think that a person who's been carrying
1370360	1372880	a God hates sign most of her life
1372880	1374400	would be the correct person
1374400	1376520	to lead an international conversation
1376520	1379440	about the intricacies of LGBT issues?
1379440	1381240	Because I'm an idiot.
1381240	1382080	Happy?
1382080	1384520	Basically, I agreed to the podcast
1384520	1386920	because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.
1386920	1390040	A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church
1390080	1393320	wants to mediate a conversation between me
1393320	1395360	and the author of Harry Potter.
1395360	1397160	Would you say no to that?
1397160	1400320	Maybe, if you're smart.
1400320	1402880	Last month, the podcast was announced
1402880	1407600	in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,
1407600	1411280	obviously a tendentious framing that posits JoRoe
1411280	1414520	as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.
1414520	1417480	The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling
1417520	1421000	complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,
1421000	1423640	as well as a photo of an angry trans mob
1423640	1426320	holding a rotten hell Rowling sign
1426320	1429200	juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians
1429200	1432480	burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.
1432480	1434840	This did not bode well.
1434840	1437440	So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter
1437440	1440280	because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy
1440280	1444360	to some kind of unearned JK Rowling redemption tour.
1444360	1448000	This caused Megan's mom Shirley to quote tweet me
1448000	1450580	calling me a bigot against God.
1450580	1454500	I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.
1454500	1455960	There's only one of him.
1455960	1458200	And he could really use your help, Shirley.
1458200	1460640	I said in these tweets that I felt used,
1460640	1462960	which that is how I felt,
1462960	1466440	but ultimately I need to take full responsibility
1466440	1468000	for my involvement in this.
1468000	1470640	The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this
1470640	1472600	is you honestly have no idea
1472600	1474840	what the final product is gonna be like.
1474840	1478760	So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.
1478760	1482180	And I can't really say that Megan misled me.
1482180	1484480	There were red flags from the beginning,
1484480	1488040	and I ignored them because I was projecting my own hopes
1488040	1489440	onto the situation.
1489440	1491760	You know, it's a compelling story.
1491760	1495600	I liked the idea that this famous former bigot
1495600	1499200	could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.
1499200	1501640	We all love a good redemption arc,
1501640	1505640	and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.
1505640	1507640	That's something I've moved away from,
1507640	1508920	but there's still part of me
1508920	1511120	that wants to see the best in people
1511120	1513800	and to believe that people can change
1513800	1517960	if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.
1518960	1521600	Maybe my wishful thinking was
1521600	1524680	that because Megan left Westbro,
1524680	1527080	that must mean that she must understand
1527080	1531600	the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?
1532360	1534560	And despite no evidence for this,
1534560	1538440	my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally
1538440	1542280	and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe
1542280	1546000	about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?
1546920	1547840	Wrong.
1547840	1549680	I'm Megan Phelps-Roper,
1549680	1552920	and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

1559480	1563560	is more than seven hours of apologetics for J.K.R.
1563560	1566840	The podcast presents Rowling as a complex,
1566840	1569080	humane, heroic figure
1569080	1572080	with an inspiring feminist backstory.
1572080	1574040	Joe Rowling's rise to success
1574040	1576400	is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.
1576400	1579680	Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob
1579680	1581600	of transgender activists.
1581600	1584360	♪ Birds go home, birds go home ♪
1584360	1587360	All because she, as a woman,
1587360	1592360	had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.
1593000	1597600	I had been becoming increasingly concerned
1597600	1600440	about the way in which women were being shut down.
1600440	1604160	Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.
1604160	1606960	Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing
1606960	1611960	of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists
1612640	1614440	whom Rowling describes as
1614480	1618400	a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.
1618400	1622160	For the first five hours of this podcast,
1622160	1626360	Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob
1626360	1631360	of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.
1631560	1634400	You are murdering trans children!
1634400	1635240	Yeah!
1635240	1636640	Let's get up on time!
1636640	1637680	A huge amount of,
1637680	1639960	I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
1639960	1642120	And you did it at my birthday dinner.
1642160	1643400	There's this one clip
1643400	1648080	of some kind of Antifa super soldier's abrasive screaming
1648080	1650760	that they play, like, once per episode.
1650760	1653280	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!
1653280	1655120	You look like you got your teeth knocked out,
1655120	1656680	you fucking fascist!
1656680	1658920	Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares
1658920	1660640	and you will die alone!
1660640	1664400	And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks
1664400	1667200	chanting some kind of medieval lament.
1667200	1670080	You will die alone and you will burn in hell!
1670200	1673960	You will die alone and you will burn in hell!
1675480	1678480	Just in case you didn't get from the title
1678480	1680560	that this is a witch hunt.
1680560	1684400	You will die alone and you will burn in hell!
1686880	1688200	Do you guys get it?
1688200	1689840	Do you get it yet?
1689840	1692960	You got your teeth knocked out, you fucking fascist!
1692960	1694320	Let's get up on time!
1694320	1696720	And then these mobs of irrational,
1696720	1699760	misogynistic, trans rights fanatics
1700440	1703400	are contrasted with this poignant story
1703400	1707000	of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband
1707000	1710760	to publish our generation's most beloved novels.
1710760	1713600	I was still very committed to those parts
1713600	1715840	that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,
1715840	1717480	because there was a truth to them
1718360	1719840	and there was a power to them.
1719840	1723320	The only voices of genuine trans dissent
1723320	1726520	appear in episode six out of seven,
1726520	1728560	more than five hours in.
1728560	1730240	And there's only two of us.
1730240	1733400	One is me, shame,
1733400	1735760	and the other is a teenager named Noah
1735760	1739040	who kinda just seems like he wants to be liked
1739040	1742720	and understood and wishes that his favorite author
1742720	1746720	would please stop saying bigoted things about him.
1746720	1748120	I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,
1748120	1750160	or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,
1750160	1754320	especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.
1754320	1756880	I can't even state how important it was to me.
1756880	1759680	J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography
1759680	1761800	from my third grade classroom
1761800	1763640	and I kept it for a long time
1763640	1764800	because I just loved reading it
1764800	1766280	because I just admired her so much.
1766280	1769400	It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.
1769400	1771120	On my last day editing this video,
1771120	1772680	I got in touch with Noah.
1772680	1775000	I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast
1775000	1777960	he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.
1777960	1780160	I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue
1780160	1782760	are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.
1782760	1785240	Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,
1785240	1788040	but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,
1788040	1790400	the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,
1790400	1792400	well-being, and ability to survive.
1792400	1794680	How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling
1794680	1797120	should come second to fighting for maintained access
1797120	1799640	to healthcare, support, and general resources
1799640	1802320	for children and adolescents seeking gender care.
1802320	1803240	I agree.
1803240	1805200	The most frustrating thing about this podcast
1805200	1808040	is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.
1808040	1811400	They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling
1811400	1813080	is the victim of a witch hunt
1813080	1815800	in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.
1815800	1818960	These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
1820720	1823320	I mean, Turf is basically witch.
1823320	1826280	But if you point this out, they just deny it.
1826280	1828520	Show me the actual words, Jack.
1828520	1830480	Show me where I said I'm the victim
1830480	1832680	of a witch hunt by trans people.
1832680	1836000	You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1836000	1839040	Yes, a podcast on which I never once say
1839040	1841960	I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.
1841960	1842800	What are you talking about?
1843520	1844360	I'm not scamming the government,
1844360	1845200	if that's what you're saying.
1845200	1846560	Your license plate says scamming.
1846560	1849280	Uh, no.
1849280	1851160	What do you mean, no?
1851160	1852480	Yes.
1852480	1855320	Joanne, show me where I ever said
1855320	1858440	that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.
1858440	1860760	Why would you even think that?
1860760	1863200	You're crazy.
1863200	1866880	By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt

1869960	1871920	And Meghan is not much better.
1871920	1874600	Like, there's this whole section in episode two
1874600	1876560	where Meghan interviews Christians
1876560	1879560	who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,
1879560	1882640	and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.
1882640	1885960	So looking back, would you say that the Christian parents
1885960	1888280	were maybe part of a moral panic?
1888280	1889200	Yeah, absolutely.
1889200	1891080	It's a scary world out there.
1891080	1894560	Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests
1894560	1896240	against Joe Roe are equivalent
1896240	1898600	to the Christian ones in the 90s,
1898600	1901000	but she does heavily imply it.
1901000	1904240	There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,
1904240	1908320	which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,
1908320	1912280	to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,
1912280	1916280	boycotted, and in some cases, burned.
1916280	1918760	When confronted about the obvious implications
1918760	1921880	of the podcast's title, Meghan said,
1921880	1923520	The title is ambiguous.
1923520	1925400	Toward the end of her conversations,
1925400	1927920	I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling
1927920	1931120	about discernment, about how a person can ever know
1931120	1933240	if they're standing up for what's right
1933240	1934920	or joining a moral panic.
1934920	1938640	I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.
1938640	1941880	Meghan, I was not surprised.
1941880	1943120	I know I won't ever regret
1943120	1945240	having stood up on this issue, ever.
1945240	1948000	The podcast released new episodes weekly,
1948000	1949880	and whenever Meghan was challenged
1949880	1953520	about the blatant one-sidedness, Meghan would respond,
1953520	1955920	Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened
1955920	1957720	to the whole podcast yet.
1958400	1960200	Maybe you should preserve judgment.
1960200	1963040	Much more of other perspectives is coming.
1963040	1965520	Make sure to tune in next week.
1965520	1969160	More bombshell revelations to come.
1969160	1972760	Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,
1972760	1975740	and I truly do not think that anyone
1975740	1978560	with basic media comprehension skills
1978560	1980360	could come away from this thinking
1980360	1983100	that the main intent was anything other
1983100	1986480	than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr
1986480	1991480	of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.
1993160	1995880	This is the obvious implication of the podcast
1995880	1998680	from the first words to the very last.
1998680	2002400	And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.
2002400	2005280	The final episode concludes with this.
2005280	2007480	There are more important things in this world
2007480	2010200	than being popular, and that doesn't mean
2010200	2012160	it's more important to me to be right.
2013040	2016000	It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.
2016000	2018400	Why would you end on that note?
2018400	2022080	Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is
2022080	2025140	if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe
2025140	2027680	that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?
2027680	2030000	I don't regret it because I did the right thing.
2030000	2032080	Like, there really is no other reasonable way
2032080	2036080	to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.
2036080	2038080	If you believe that J.K. Rowling
2038080	2041080	is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,
2041080	2042820	then just say that.
2042820	2045240	Make the argument you want to make.
2045240	2048920	Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,
2048920	2053080	this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.
2053080	2056260	Don't rely on innuendo and framing
2056260	2061260	and lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point
2061540	2064880	while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda
2064880	2068640	beyond I just believe in conversation.
2068640	2071180	I don't know, I just find this a slippery
2071180	2073120	and dishonest way to argue.
2073120	2075500	But if you happen to be a fan
2075500	2077700	of slippery and dishonest arguments,
2077700	2082700	you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

2122320	2126600	Chapter four, Joe Rose transphobia.
2126600	2127440	That's it.
2130320	2131720	I'm going full Slytherin.
2131740	2134900	In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,
2134900	2138540	Joe Rose compares trans activists to Death Eaters,
2138540	2141380	the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.
2141380	2145660	My position is that this activist movement
2145660	2148300	in the form that it's currently taking
2148300	2150620	echoes the very thing that I was warning against
2150620	2151620	in Harry Potter.
2151620	2154100	The Death Eaters claimed we have been made
2154100	2156740	to live in secret, and now is our time.
2156740	2161300	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,
2161320	2162960	misogynistic movement.
2162960	2165200	When an article then claimed she had equated
2165200	2166980	trans people to Death Eaters,
2166980	2171040	the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,
2171040	2174360	because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters,
2174360	2177040	not trans people in general.
2177040	2178960	Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,
2178960	2181280	I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.
2181280	2183800	So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,
2183800	2186280	lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.
2186280	2189160	J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,
2189180	2191740	because she expresses it as an endless series
2191740	2194780	of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.
2194780	2197920	A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle
2197920	2202300	consisting of a Mott, that is, a tower atop a mound or hill,
2202300	2205740	easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard
2205740	2209300	that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.
2209300	2211780	So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes
2211780	2215740	a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.
2215740	2218500	And then, when confronted with counterarguments,
2218520	2221080	they walk it back to a much less controversial
2221080	2224600	and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.
2224600	2228520	For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim
2228520	2230480	like sex is real.
2230480	2232200	What does she mean by that?
2232200	2233840	What are the implications?
2233840	2236420	Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks
2236420	2240640	it's very sinister that in the Associated Press Style Guide,
2240640	2243740	it says that instead of referring to a trans woman
2243740	2246360	as a man who identifies as a woman,
2246380	2249700	journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.
2249700	2253460	That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.
2253460	2256760	They've edged from identifies as a woman,
2256760	2258820	so a man identifies as a woman,
2258820	2260660	and I think we all understand what that means,
2260660	2264460	into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep
2264460	2266540	that I'm talking about.
2266540	2271340	We are using language to make accurate definition
2271340	2274380	of sex difference unspeakable.
2274400	2275940	Which is, of course, false,
2275940	2279740	because the words trans and cis exist precisely
2279740	2282220	to make it easy to talk about sex difference.
2282220	2283900	Thanks a lot, Tumblr.
2283900	2285820	God, there's this whole section of the podcast
2285820	2288300	that sort of implies that transgender people
2288300	2292060	were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into
2292060	2293340	because we don't have time.
2293340	2294940	Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks
2294940	2298700	that all people who menstruate must be referred to as women.
2298700	2299860	Or was it wombin?
2299860	2301380	I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.
2301380	2303860	So trans men and trans masculine people,
2303860	2307500	they're all women and must be referred to as women,
2307500	2310100	because J.K. Rowling demands it.
2310100	2311680	This is controversial, right?
2311680	2314740	Calling trans women men who identify as women,
2314740	2316540	calling trans men women.
2316540	2319620	This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.
2319620	2322140	Trans women are men, trans men are women.
2322140	2325700	That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.
2325700	2329040	Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,
2329040	2331600	Rowling walks the argument back and says,
2331600	2333840	I'm being persecuted just for saying
2333840	2336080	that women should be allowed to discuss
2336080	2338800	how being female has shaped our lives.
2338800	2341200	Women should be allowed to discuss
2341200	2343520	how being female has shaped our lives.
2343520	2346400	This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial
2346400	2349920	interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.
2349920	2353160	And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes
2353160	2355920	make about trans people follows this pattern.
2355920	2358840	J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstater,
2359600	2360840	will tweet inflammatory things like,
2360840	2363100	men cannot change into women.
2363100	2364760	But then when she's criticized,
2364760	2366680	she'll say that she's being attacked
2366680	2368760	for gender critical belief.
2368760	2370400	Gender critical belief,
2370400	2374040	which is the absolutely ordinary belief about sex,
2374040	2377000	that your mother and your grandmother are women,
2377000	2378920	that being female is a thing.
2378920	2381560	Your mother and grandmother are women.
2381560	2383560	Being female is a thing.
2383560	2385840	That's literally all I'm saying.
2385840	2388080	But if that's literally all she was saying,
2388120	2390840	then no one would be mad, would they?
2390840	2391680	Nine.
2391680	2392600	Gnar.
2392600	2395880	Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.
2395880	2398520	Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.
2398520	2399760	Your mom's a woman.
2399760	2401160	Ah!
2401160	2403880	This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.
2403880	2406760	They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,
2406760	2408680	exhibitionists, and voyeurs.
2408680	2411560	Then when trans people, understandably, get mad,
2411560	2413720	they'll say, look, I'm being attacked
2413720	2417120	just for saying that being female is part of my experience.
2417120	2418160	It's dishonest.
2418160	2420240	They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,
2420240	2422280	and then when trans people talk trash back,
2422280	2423920	they pretend that they're being victimized
2423920	2426080	for making totally innocuous statements.
2426080	2429760	We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.
2429760	2433840	I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met
2433840	2436440	until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,
2436440	2439640	whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on,
2439640	2443040	I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.
2443040	2446360	It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.
2446360	2447920	And somehow it always worked.
2447920	2450040	So a birthday boy argument is when you make
2450040	2452440	aggressive, inflammatory assertions,
2452440	2456200	followed by teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,
2456200	2457680	when the target reacts with anything
2457680	2459440	less than extreme politeness.
2459440	2460880	Another common tactic you'll see
2460880	2463440	any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed
2463440	2465240	is you'll see someone jump in to say,
2465240	2468480	show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.
2468480	2470640	For example, here's someone on Twitter
2470640	2472920	called large gamete producer.
2472920	2476000	It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist
2476640	2479880	that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate
2479880	2482080	is horribly oppressive and degrading,
2482080	2483960	but then they'll just straight up call themselves
2483960	2486560	large gamete producer.
2486560	2489480	Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.
2489480	2493480	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
2493480	2495680	Oh, I like it, it's very broodmother.
2495680	2497520	That Rowling's words regularly appear
2497520	2500600	in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence
2500600	2502840	that she has in the anti-trans movement.
2502840	2505160	She's like their queen, their leader,
2505440	2506360	their headmistress.
2506360	2508080	She's the best thing that ever happened to them,
2508080	2510320	because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading
2510320	2511160	a lot of people.
2511160	2512200	If you know, you know.
2512200	2516440	Large gamete producer says, JK isn't anti-trans.
2516440	2520000	Give me just one direct quote that she has said
2520000	2521400	which is anti-trans.
2521400	2522700	Oh, what's that?
2522700	2524240	You can't find one?
2524240	2526440	Well, color me shocked.
2526440	2527280	Imagine.
2527280	2529640	Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,
2529640	2533160	let's take a look at large gamete producer's profile.
2533160	2535720	Trans women are not women, they are men.
2535720	2538480	Trans men are not men, they are women.
2538480	2539880	Nothing can change that.
2539880	2542260	Sex is binary.
2542260	2545360	Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,
2545360	2548720	trans men are women is a transphobic statement,
2548720	2551400	then what would they consider a transphobic statement?
2551400	2553640	This is why the first question you should always ask
2553640	2556720	such people is, do you believe that transphobia
2556720	2558460	is a legitimate concept?
2558460	2560160	What are some examples of statements
2560160	2562200	that you would consider transphobic?
2562200	2563840	Because many of them don't believe
2563840	2566080	that transphobia is a valid concept
2566080	2567760	because they don't think that trans people
2567760	2569400	are a legitimate minority.
2569400	2570880	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
2570880	2573040	There's no such thing as a trans person.
2573040	2574000	There is no such thing.
2574000	2576900	There are people that call themselves these things
2576900	2580160	that may have other issues manifesting
2580160	2582280	that then make them think they're this, but no.
2582280	2584960	We have to stop using any words like transgender.
2584960	2586700	There may be more words that we have to say
2586700	2587640	in order to say that.
2587640	2589960	We may call it transgender ideology,
2589960	2591480	but when it comes to a person,
2591480	2593980	they may be following transgender ideology,
2593980	2595520	but they are not transgender.
2595520	2598060	There is no such thing as a man or a woman
2598060	2600240	being anything other than a man or a woman.
2600240	2602600	So when they say, show me an example
2602600	2605280	of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said,
2605280	2606560	this is a trap.
2606560	2607800	They're just messing with you.
2607800	2609840	There's nothing that she could have said
2609840	2611880	that they would acknowledge as transphobic.
2611880	2613160	Now, if you're someone who believes
2613160	2615240	that transphobia is a valid concept
2615240	2618240	and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,
2618280	2620240	but you just genuinely are unaware
2620240	2622560	of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,
2622560	2624720	then I will refer you to my past video
2624720	2626680	on J.K. Rowling's transphobia
2626680	2628560	rather than recapping it all here.
2628560	2631240	Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse
2631240	2632560	since I made that video.
2632560	2634400	I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.
2634400	2637520	True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,
2637520	2639340	because she's not a complete idiot,
2639340	2642140	but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.
2642140	2644400	She said, save our children.
2644400	2645840	I love homosexuals.
2645840	2647780	For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke
2648320	2650020	doesn't say, I hate black people,
2650020	2652260	but he will share a lot of statistics
2652260	2654140	about anti-white crime.
2654140	2656820	So this is not really a very good criterion
2656820	2659580	for deciding who's a bigot, is it?
2659580	2662460	What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again
2662460	2664300	about transgender rapists,
2664300	2667180	about the danger trans women pose to cis women.
2667180	2669320	She implies that trans-inclusive language
2669320	2672660	is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.
2672660	2675940	She writes at length about the vague, nefarious cabal
2675940	2678100	of endocrinologists and ideologue
2678100	2681260	that is supposedly persuading confused,
2681260	2683480	vulnerable girls to transition.
2683480	2686500	To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,
2686500	2688820	I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,
2688820	2692200	but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.
2692200	2695160	Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.
2695160	2697020	It asks them to fear.
2697020	2701300	It creates phobias of trans people.
2701300	2705500	It creates trans phobias.
2705500	2706380	If you will.
2706380	2708700	Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician
2708700	2712940	Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights
2712940	2715860	via a T-shirt she got from anti-trans hate monger
2715860	2717100	Posey Parker.
2717100	2718620	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
2718620	2720780	There's no such thing as a trans person.
2720780	2721740	There is no such thing.
2721740	2724380	If there's one thing that I want people to understand
2724380	2726100	about Rowling's transphobia,
2726100	2728140	it's that this is not a case
2728140	2730700	of someone posting a couple insensitive tweets
2730700	2732380	that got blown out of proportion.
2732380	2735220	Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent
2735220	2736300	of trans rights.
2736300	2739320	This has been her main issue for several years now.
2739320	2741580	And because she's so famous,
2741580	2744420	she's become the de facto global champion
2744420	2746340	of backlash to trans rights.
2746340	2748980	Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.
2748980	2751820	Except worse, because she's way more famous
2751820	2754980	and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.
2754980	2757180	Rowling has also praised self-described
2757180	2759020	theocratic fascist Matt Walsh
2759020	2761180	for his transphobic propaganda film.
2761180	2765140	She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,
2765860	2767060	known as Tims among people
2767060	2769060	for whom this has become an unhealthy obsession.
2769060	2771260	She retweets images of the trans colors
2771260	2773240	being erased from the progress flag.
2773240	2775700	Also the colors representing queer people of color.
2775700	2777060	So, you know, great.
2777060	2777900	Love that.
2777900	2780580	Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic
2780580	2782600	for the principled and valiant purpose
2782600	2784100	of defending lesbians.
2784100	2786360	It's something of a fixation for her.
2786360	2788460	I find this particularly gross
2788460	2790940	because it plays into the lesbophobic trope
2790940	2793620	that gay women are especially anti-trans,
2793620	2796740	when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic
2796740	2797740	of cis people.
2797740	2800420	According to a survey of young adults in the UK,
2800420	2803260	lesbians were most likely to know a trans person
2803260	2806680	and also most likely, at 96%,
2806680	2808060	to say that they're supportive
2808060	2810260	or very supportive of trans people.
2810260	2812020	So I think it's fair to say
2812020	2815980	that most gay women are probably not super thrilled
2815980	2819660	whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.
2819660	2821740	My own partner is a cis lesbian
2821780	2824140	and I asked her if she enjoys J.K. Rowling
2824140	2827460	defending her from the transsexuals and she said,
2827460	2830300	"'It makes me wanna gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.'"
2830300	2833900	By the way, here is J.K. Rowling enjoying a bit of banter
2833900	2836700	with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,
2836700	2839340	the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.
2839340	2841380	Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member
2841380	2842660	of the House of Lords
2842660	2845980	who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.
2845980	2848860	In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,
2848860	2852060	claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading
2852060	2854180	the status of women and girls.
2854180	2857180	Truly one of the great lesbian allies.
2857180	2859940	And in 2022, here is J.K. Rowling
2859940	2862060	joking around with Lady Nicholson.
2862060	2863780	"'Excellent question, Emma.
2863780	2867180	"'Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women
2867180	2870220	"'excludes and oppresses the most marginalized
2870220	2873840	"'of all groups, i.e. people with penises and beards
2873840	2875420	"'who want to shag women.
2875420	2878680	"'And before you say, but aren't they straight men?
2878680	2881760	"'They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.'"
2881760	2885240	Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have
2885240	2887040	for the Gryffindor common room,
2887040	2889680	and just look at this interaction for what it is.
2889680	2890920	Two straight women,
2890920	2894080	one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,
2894080	2896080	having a nice little chuckle together
2896080	2899160	about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.
2899160	2900720	So that's it, right?
2900720	2901640	It's over.
2903640	2904840	Case closed.
2905680	2908840	I still like hammering things.
2910320	2911560	I'm not gonna argue anymore
2911560	2914400	about whether J.K. Rowling is transphobic,
2914400	2916880	because anyone who believes in transphobia
2916880	2919600	can see that obviously she is.
2919600	2922080	The question now is whether transphobia
2922080	2925360	is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,
2925360	2928400	the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,
2928400	2930320	misogyny, and homophobia.
2930320	2931920	That's usually what we're talking about
2931920	2934120	when we talk about J.K. Rowling, right?
2934160	2936960	Whether it's fair to cancel her.
2936960	2940480	That's what the witch trials of J.K. Rowling is about.
2940480	2943920	The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.
2943920	2946680	Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint
2946680	2949600	worthy of polite consideration and respect
2949600	2951760	in liberal humane society?
2951760	2953960	Or is it just an ugly prejudice
2953960	2956040	that we can justifiably react to
2956040	2958040	with scorn and condemnation?
2958040	2960120	And there's an even broader question here
2960120	2963640	about whether we can justifiably react to anything
2963680	2965520	with scorn and condemnation.
2965520	2967920	Is canceling ever warranted?
2967920	2972240	Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?
2972240	2975840	Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices
2975840	2979320	a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas,
2979320	2980760	where we can all sit around
2980760	2983160	debating the legitimacy of gay marriage
2983160	2986200	or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?
2986200	2988200	Is the final solution a myth
2988200	2990840	promulgated by the international Jew?
2990840	2994400	Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?
2994400	2997240	Wouldn't the taxpayer save a lot of money
2997240	2999720	if there weren't so many disabled people?
2999720	3000760	Who knows?
3000760	3002320	These are open questions.
3002320	3005080	Let's sit down with people on both sides,
3005080	3009160	on many sides, and have calm, civil conversations about it
3009160	3011600	for the rest of our goddamn lives.
3011600	3014280	Chapter five, debate.
3016160	3018160	Sar, I know I did this look before
3018160	3021440	and it's not related to the video topic at all,
3021440	3023280	but it just makes me feel sliving.
3023280	3025600	The boy who slived.
3025600	3027280	So Megan Phelps-Roper's viewpoint
3027280	3029480	seems to be that scorn and condemnation
3029480	3031120	are never appropriate,
3031120	3033000	that we should approach every conflict
3033000	3034600	with empathy and compassion,
3034600	3036520	even when dealing with the worst,
3036520	3039480	most destructive people in the world.
3039480	3042640	Hi, my name is Megan, and my heretical belief
3042640	3045240	is that even the people who seem to be
3045240	3048120	the worst, most destructive people in the world
3048120	3051680	are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy
3051680	3053640	if we want to find a way to change their minds.
3053640	3057680	In her book, in her TED talk, in her public appearances,
3057680	3060560	Megan expresses the idea that society
3060560	3065040	has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way,
3065040	3067560	that we've all become extremists,
3067560	3068840	that in some sense,
3068840	3072560	we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.
3072560	3074800	I can't help but see in our public discourse
3074800	3077280	so many of the same destructive impulses
3077280	3078840	that ruled my former church.
3078840	3081280	She identifies things like certainty,
3081280	3083320	vilification of compromise,
3083320	3085040	us versus them thinking,
3085040	3086720	suppression of empathy,
3086720	3089440	and celebration of death and misfortune
3089440	3092880	as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.
3092880	3094760	And this really bothers Megan,
3094760	3097520	because she claims that a decade ago,
3097520	3099240	when she went on Twitter to tweet about
3099240	3102120	how f*** marriage is abominable to God,
3102120	3106400	it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way
3106440	3110160	that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.
3110160	3114120	And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.
3114120	3115880	She's totally right that if you want
3115880	3117440	to change people's minds,
3117440	3120240	then approaching them with compassion and empathy
3120240	3122880	is usually the best way to do that.
3122880	3124800	But Megan reaches another conclusion
3124800	3126240	that I don't agree with,
3126240	3129660	which is that because compassion and civil conversation
3129660	3131960	are most likely to persuade people,
3131960	3134680	we should never cancel anyone,
3134680	3136720	even the most horrible bigots.
3136720	3140400	And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point,
3140400	3141520	but what Megan means is
3141520	3143800	we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.
3143800	3146480	We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest
3146480	3148160	or raise our voices.
3148160	3150960	We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,
3150960	3154080	because that's just not how you change minds.
3154080	3156040	And I get why Megan thinks this, right?
3156040	3158880	Deradicalization was a really important part
3158880	3160520	of her life experience.
3160520	3162220	She's also clearly holding out hope
3162220	3164520	that other members of her family will leave Westboro
3165360	3166280	and have a life on the outside.
3166280	3168560	She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.
3168560	3170880	The last lines of her book address her family.
3170880	3172760	I want to tell them that I love them.
3172760	3174760	I'll just have to find another way.
3174760	3176680	This is touching and human
3176680	3179760	and also kind of a conflict of interest.
3179760	3182320	The problem is Megan's views about this
3182320	3185120	only make sense if you assume that Megan
3185120	3187360	is the main character of reality.
3187360	3190600	If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots
3190600	3193880	is more important than protecting the people they target.
3194240	3196440	Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds
3196440	3199920	is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.
3199920	3203320	As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old
3203320	3205600	and she's still homophobic.
3205600	3207720	But even without Anita's blessing,
3207720	3211120	gay rights have still somehow managed to progress
3211120	3214080	since the 1970s, because gay activists
3214080	3216720	didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.
3216720	3220320	They needed to defeat her, and that's what they did.
3220320	3222680	We have to accept that realistically,
3222680	3226240	persuading all the bigots is just not an option.
3226240	3229560	Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,
3229560	3231680	but there will always be bigots.
3231680	3235160	And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them
3235160	3237960	is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.
3237960	3240800	Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,
3240800	3245040	we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?
3245040	3245880	Nah.
3245880	3247120	You would only think that if you're
3247120	3249160	a total moral relativist.
3249160	3251200	I guess controversial opinion,
3251200	3254920	but bigotry is shameful, and it should be shamed.
3254920	3255880	I'll say it.
3255880	3258220	You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas
3258220	3260600	in your head, you might feel afraid
3260600	3262800	to express them publicly for fear
3262800	3265120	of being shamed or judged.
3265120	3268360	Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia
3268360	3270960	that punishes people for wrong-think?
3270960	3274440	No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful,
3274440	3276000	and you should be ashamed of it,
3276000	3278600	and the people judging you are right to do so.
3278600	3281320	And sure, there are some very patient people
3281320	3284360	who devote their lives to deradicalizing bigots,
3284360	3287680	which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.
3287680	3289360	There's a guy named Darryl Davis
3289360	3291840	who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan
3291840	3294800	for over 30 years, and he claims he's convinced
3294800	3297200	more than 200 of them to leave.
3297200	3298520	And good for him.
3298520	3301320	Deradicalization is a valid strategy,
3301320	3303800	but it cannot be the only strategy,
3303800	3306960	and it must not be the primary strategy.
3306960	3309120	Because we're not going to defeat racism
3309120	3312840	by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.
3312840	3315120	Feminists would be wasting their time
3315120	3318160	trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.
3318160	3320560	In general, I think that the massive effort
3320560	3323360	that it takes to maybe persuade bigots
3323360	3326120	is better spent persuading other people
3326120	3327560	not to listen to them.
3327560	3330520	And it's also worth cautioning that deradicalization
3330520	3333760	is often a messy and incomplete process.
3333760	3336860	20-year-old white nationalist Peter Saitanovic
3337760	3339820	became the face of the fascist Unite the Right rally
3339820	3344060	in 2017 when a photo of him mid-scream,
3344060	3346740	tiki, torch in hand, was published
3346740	3348980	in news outlets all over the country.
3348980	3351300	Peter was unrepentant in interviews
3351300	3353600	he gave immediately after the rally,
3353600	3355940	but he began to question his beliefs
3355940	3358620	after befriending a Muslim woman who,
3358620	3360940	according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,
3360940	3363720	challenged his views without insulting him,
3363720	3367080	allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.
3367080	3369360	Peter is no longer a white nationalist,
3369360	3371380	but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out
3371380	3373100	every trace of bigotry.
3373100	3375400	In a 2019 interview with the London School
3375400	3378240	of Economics student paper, Peter said,
3378240	3380320	I don't like the whole transgender thing.
3380320	3382520	You're born either a man or a woman.
3382520	3386400	So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.
3386400	3389240	When I did deradicalization work on YouTube,
3389240	3392120	I used to get some criticism from people of color
3392120	3394280	who were not thrilled that I was bringing
3394280	3397800	a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,
3397800	3400240	a frustration that I totally understand.
3400240	3403120	To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,
3403120	3405840	diverse leftist communities are maybe not
3405840	3408440	the best holding space for someone who's
3408440	3410560	a bit of a Nazi but working on it.
3410560	3412760	In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,
3412760	3415800	I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,
3415800	3418600	but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant
3418760	3423180	skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.
3423180	3425160	This is pretty common with people who used
3425160	3427160	to be religious fundamentalists.
3427160	3429240	They were so certain they were right,
3429240	3431760	only to realize that everything they believed
3431760	3433440	about the world is wrong.
3433440	3437400	So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions
3437400	3440520	because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.
3440520	3443720	Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly
3443720	3445660	that I was doing the right thing,
3445660	3447440	and then to leave and come to believe
3447440	3449660	that it was so destructive and harmful,
3450840	3455840	I had this moment in time, and it lasted for many months,
3456280	3459720	where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?
3459720	3463080	This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,
3463080	3467240	but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else
3467240	3470240	can cause problems, especially where topics
3470240	3472280	of social justice are concerned.
3472280	3475600	Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism
3475600	3480000	that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling
3480000	3482800	to have calm, philosophical debates
3482800	3484720	about whether they should have rights?
3484720	3487960	Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?
3487960	3490120	Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,
3490120	3492720	in his podcast about Megan's podcast,
3492720	3495080	can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?
3495080	3498600	I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts
3498600	3500760	until we can figure out what's going on.
3500760	3504440	Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,
3504440	3508600	complained that trans activism and activism in general
3508600	3512840	is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.
3512840	3517720	I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability
3517720	3522720	and even frank mental illness in the activist community.
3522720	3525920	I mean, really, in all activist communities,
3525920	3530920	the level of viciousness and hysteria is,
3531160	3533360	you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.
3533360	3535120	Diversity, when?
3535120	3538200	Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.
3538200	3542080	Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions
3542080	3545840	when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?
3545840	3547440	Aren't there certain situations
3547440	3549600	where strong emotions are warranted?
3549600	3551440	It reminds me of this awful episode
3551440	3553960	of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,
3553960	3556880	where Lil Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral
3556880	3559320	with his usual whining sophistry,
3559320	3561580	and Joe gently raises objections
3561620	3563700	for Ben to talk circles around.
3563700	3567140	The human sex drive was made to procreate
3567140	3570420	within a stable relationship in order to progenerate
3570420	3572220	and have future generations of people.
3572220	3574140	Misuse of that sex drive in any way,
3574140	3576660	whether you're talking about from masturbation
3576660	3579820	to homosexual activity, is therefore a diminishment
3579820	3580940	of the use of that drive.
3580940	3584060	That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.
3584060	3587580	All of the top comments on this video are like this.
3587580	3589300	Imagine talking about different beliefs
3589300	3591340	while still having a productive conversation.
3592100	3593540	Things progress when you don't demonize people.
3593540	3595060	The discussion here was excellent.
3595060	3596780	Two guys with opposing opinions,
3596780	3599420	speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,
3599420	3602700	shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.
3602700	3604300	This is how it should be done.
3604300	3605460	Kudos to both of them.
3605460	3606700	Joe is a great interviewer.
3606700	3608160	He can totally disagree with someone
3608160	3610540	and still have a calm, collective conversation.
3610540	3611780	This is how it should be.
3611780	3613260	Just two people sharing ideas,
3613260	3615180	learning different point of views from each other.
3615180	3617260	This is why Joe is the number one podcast.
3617260	3619620	Joe Rogan beautifully asks the tough questions,
3619620	3621180	and Ben answers honestly.
3622020	3622860	He is strong in his faith.
3622860	3625460	I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views
3625460	3627220	and they have a civil conversation.
3627220	3628060	Great learning.
3628060	3630820	And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men
3630820	3634100	to have a dispassionate, theoretical conversation
3634100	3636580	about the ethics of homosexuality,
3636580	3639940	because it's not their lives and their relationships
3639940	3641460	that are up for debate.
3641460	3644260	These people don't understand the emotional burden
3644260	3646100	placed on marginalized people
3646100	3648580	who are asked to defend their rights.
3648700	3652140	If you're straight, do you want to publicly debate
3652140	3654340	whether your marriage is valid?
3654340	3656660	Andrew Dworkin claimed that penetrative
3656660	3660380	heterosexual intercourse is inherently an act of violence.
3660380	3662620	I've noticed that most straight men
3662620	3666300	don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that,
3666300	3667900	so imagine how they'd react
3667900	3670380	if there was a powerful political movement
3670380	3674300	to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.
3674300	3677940	Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,
3678020	3680060	bullying, and discrimination,
3680060	3682940	and maybe then you'll begin to understand
3682940	3685780	the hysteria of a lot of queer people.
3685780	3687780	It is my right to raise my child
3687780	3689780	with the moral precept that I find
3689780	3691700	to be beneficial for my child.
3691700	3693860	Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.
3693860	3695980	And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.
3695980	3696900	That is insane.
3696900	3699860	Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence
3699860	3702260	because he can't handle the debate.
3702260	3705340	Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.
3705340	3708580	Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation
3708580	3711300	about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?
3711300	3712140	I now have two choices.
3712140	3714300	One is to leave the country utterly.
3714300	3715260	Two is to pick up a gun.
3715260	3716960	Those are the only choices that you have left me.
3716960	3721340	Dave Rubin is a gay conservative whose career requires
3721340	3723340	that he convince his right-wing audience
3723340	3725940	that he's one of the good ones.
3725940	3728060	This means that he's willing to sit across
3728060	3731900	from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,
3731900	3733500	and listen to Ben say
3733500	3736180	he would never attend his anniversary party
3736180	3739340	because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.
3739340	3741980	There's a difference between me just being friends
3741980	3746220	with Dave and me actively participating in an event
3746220	3748140	that I feel is religiously sinful.
3748140	3750740	The two of them then congratulate themselves
3750740	3753620	about how they can still be great friends.
3753620	3756180	Why is it that we're able to do this
3756180	3757540	and most people can't do this?
3757540	3758380	That's what I'm curious about.
3758380	3760700	Because we go home at night and we can have our own lives.
3760700	3763180	And here's Dave having a civil conversation
3763220	3765020	with conservative Glenn Beck,
3765020	3767860	who compares homosexuality to alcoholism
3767860	3771900	and then congratulates himself on having the conversation.
3771900	3776460	I am a deeply religious man and my religion says
3776460	3781460	man and a woman, that is the basic building block of family.
3781540	3784000	And that's what I believe.
3784000	3789000	But I also am, I also know God created you
3789920	3793400	just like he created me, flaws and all.
3794760	3797800	I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,
3797800	3801400	that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism
3801400	3803680	because it runs in my family.
3803680	3806800	So does craziness, but it runs in my family.
3806800	3808920	Well, Dave smiles and nods,
3808920	3810720	probably because he's thinking about
3810720	3814200	how much he enjoys the taste of boots.
3814200	3817960	Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis
3817960	3821280	and then we're good because they get it, they get it,
3821280	3823040	that's my governor, yeah.
3823040	3825920	I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin
3825920	3830240	and they see, finally, a reasonable gay person
3830240	3834160	who doesn't scream bigot at everyone who disagrees
3834160	3837040	and can actually have a civil conversation.
3837040	3838600	But that's not what I see.
3838600	3840880	I look at Dave Rubin and I see
3840880	3844160	a sublimely bootlicking doormat
3844160	3846880	who won't even defend his own family
3846880	3849680	from the most fundamental disrespect.
3849680	3851520	I also can't help but notice
3851520	3854280	that none of these civil conversations
3854280	3856640	seem to change anyone's mind.
3856640	3859000	Persuasion is more complicated
3859000	3861520	and less rational than people think.
3861520	3865240	Meghan often says that she was deradicalized on Twitter,
3865240	3867360	but if you read her book carefully,
3867360	3870160	you'll notice that that's not exactly true.
3870160	3873880	The major precipitating event for Meghan's crisis of faith
3873880	3875840	was her mother's mistreatment
3875880	3877520	at the hands of an increasingly
3877520	3879880	misogynistic church leadership
3879880	3882520	that made Meghan feel like she was the victim
3882520	3883840	of the church for once.
3883840	3885960	She says of the church discipline,
3885960	3888000	for the first time in my life,
3888000	3889840	the accused were people I lived with
3889840	3891440	and knew most intimately,
3891440	3893800	and I knew that the judgments leveled by the elders
3893800	3894720	were wrong.
3894720	3898320	I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.
3898320	3901040	So she finally experienced firsthand
3901040	3903640	what it's like to be the victim of her family.
3903640	3905360	She stopped voting for the leopards
3905360	3907240	eating people's faces party
3907240	3909640	only when the leopards ate her face.
3909640	3911920	It also seems relevant to notice
3911920	3914840	that the people who had calm, civil conversations
3914840	3918440	with Meghan on Twitter were generally not gay people,
3918440	3921640	the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.
3921640	3923560	They were mostly straight men,
3923560	3925840	like director Kevin Smith,
3925840	3928240	who started hashtag save Meghan
3928240	3931680	because, quote, she's hot.
3931680	3935120	There's often an erotic component to persuasion,
3935120	3938180	and that certainly seems to be the case with Meghan,
3938180	3941960	because one of the people who helped deradicalize her
3941960	3943720	is now her husband.
3943720	3945920	And I feel like that's a relevant detail
3945920	3949160	if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion
3949160	3951660	in deradicalization experiences.
3951660	3954600	I think this experience is usually more akin
3954600	3958560	to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.
3958560	3960080	There's also a world of difference
3960120	3962720	between the mostly private conversations
3962720	3965840	that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs
3965840	3968640	and the spectacle of public debate.
3968640	3972080	Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic
3972080	3974720	because he livestreamed a civil conversation
3974720	3976000	with Dave Rubin.
3976000	3978600	So who is this conversation even for?
3978600	3981240	Well, obviously it's for the audience.
3981240	3984080	I think these civil conversations
3984080	3988340	basically function to reassure a homophobic audience
3988340	3992460	that just because they disagree with the lifestyle
3992460	3995020	doesn't mean that they hate gay people.
3995020	3996420	Look at Ben Shapiro.
3996420	3998220	He is friends with a gay.
3998220	4001220	Public debate is one way that we define the limits
4001220	4002780	of the Overton window,
4002780	4006460	the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.
4006460	4008820	So often people who want to promote bigotry
4008820	4012060	will use debate as a foot in the door.
4012060	4014900	It's a way of establishing that their prejudices
4014900	4016860	are within the realm of reasonable
4016860	4018980	and socially accepted opinion.
4018980	4022740	Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan
4022740	4026460	in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who
4026460	4030000	without the British public having a proper debate
4030000	4031380	about these issues.
4031380	4034700	Now why do we need to have a proper debate
4034700	4038500	about whether drag queens should be allowed on television
4038500	4040900	when drag performance has been a staple
4040900	4042420	of British entertainment
4042420	4044900	since at least the time of Shakespeare?
4044900	4047000	Life is a joke, that's just begun.
4047000	4049660	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
4049660	4051540	Three little maids from school.
4051540	4054220	Fishy fishy fishy fish.
4054220	4055380	As I am man,
4057880	4061660	my state is desperate for my master's love.
4061660	4065940	As I am woman, now alas the day.
4065940	4069120	Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate
4069120	4070660	on their own terms
4070660	4073820	because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.
4073820	4075860	It's how they convince the public
4075860	4079380	that their moral panic about drag queens on TV
4079380	4081820	is actually a valid concern
4081820	4085900	rather than the tedious, small-minded whining about nothing
4085900	4087140	that it really is.
4087140	4089940	Having the debate on a bigot's terms
4089940	4092540	is not a good way to win people over
4092540	4094300	unless you're really skilled
4094300	4096460	in the art of humiliating people,
4096460	4097820	which most of the time
4097820	4100680	is what public debate is actually about.
4100680	4102340	This is something that J.K. Rowling
4102340	4104220	doesn't seem to understand.
4104220	4106380	In The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,
4106380	4110560	Jo Ro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.
4110560	4114580	She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos
4114580	4118180	saying that activists are making a strategic error
4118180	4122060	and giving Milo power by protesting his events,
4122060	4125060	making him look dangerous and sexy.
4125060	4128020	But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,
4128020	4130940	Rowling characterizes this as silencing.
4130940	4133420	So is deplatforming a strategic error
4133420	4135660	that gives power to your opponent,
4135660	4138260	or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?
4138260	4139700	I find Rowling's conviction
4139700	4141980	that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos
4141980	4143240	really out of touch.
4143240	4145980	Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons
4145980	4147140	for the things he does.
4147140	4150500	He has strategies for humiliating people.
4150500	4152420	I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,
4152420	4154500	being fabulous and doing my hair,
4154500	4155860	to prepare a speech for you.
4155860	4157260	Well, a few remarks, really.
4158260	4161180	Feminism is cancer.
4161180	4162540	Thank you very much.
4162540	4164580	To again quote Ian Danskin,
4164580	4166740	you can't really reason with someone
4166740	4169140	who thinks that feminism is cancer
4169140	4171300	because you don't reason with cancer.
4171300	4172860	You eradicate it.
4172860	4175740	Rowling objects to the slogan no debate
4175740	4177740	in the strongest possible terms.
4177740	4180820	And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,
4180820	4183860	the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.
4183860	4185620	We hear it all the time.
4185620	4189420	That alarms me, really alarms me.
4189420	4192780	I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism
4192780	4193660	than no debate.
4193660	4194800	It's kind of amazing to me
4194800	4197780	that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter
4197780	4200940	are the purest example of authoritarianism.
4200940	4204100	I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough
4204100	4206460	to be capable of such a perspective.
4206460	4208860	Before I move on, I do want to clarify
4208860	4211740	that I do think there are trans issues
4211740	4213540	that are legitimately debatable
4213540	4215340	by people who are not bigots.
4216020	4218980	In my opinion, trans women and women's sports
4218980	4220440	is one of those issues.
4220440	4222860	But it's a complicated issue.
4222860	4226760	Like first of all, which sport are we talking about?
4226760	4228940	Are we talking about figure skating?
4228940	4230940	Middle school field hockey?
4230940	4232920	I see no reason why trans girls
4232920	4234620	should be excluded from that.
4234620	4237180	But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,
4237180	4239380	well then it seems plausible
4239380	4242060	that trans women who have been through male puberty
4242060	4245460	may still retain some kind of group advantage.
4245460	4249180	But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.
4249180	4251220	People are transitioning younger now
4251220	4253580	and that's another thing you have to consider.
4253580	4256460	So I'm not against debating this issue,
4256460	4258540	I just want people to approach it
4258540	4260500	with nuance and good faith.
4260500	4262700	And currently, a lot of the people
4262700	4266740	who are vocally against trans women and women's sports
4266740	4268140	sound like this.
4268140	4272740	And we will keep men out of women's sports.
4274460	4275540	How ridiculous.
4278820	4280660	That will take place on day one.
4280660	4282540	And I don't wanna debate those people.
4282540	4285260	I wanna serve them a banana cream pie.
4285260	4288700	Chapter six, illiberal methods.
4289740	4291600	One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints
4291600	4293260	about the trans rights movement
4293260	4296580	is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.
4296620	4298780	So when I first became interested
4298780	4301060	and then deeply troubled
4301060	4304260	by what I saw as a cultural movement
4304260	4306660	that was illiberal in its methods.
4306660	4309180	So what are these illiberal methods?
4309180	4313860	If you are saying this person is canceled,
4313860	4316100	that is the language of a dictator.
4316100	4316980	It's true.
4316980	4320340	Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.
4320340	4322420	First they canceled the socialists
4322420	4326220	and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.
4326860	4329660	But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.
4345540	4346780	You know, I can't help but wonder
4346780	4349500	what counts as acceptable activist methods
4349500	4352740	to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery
4352740	4354620	was taking things too far.
4354620	4357740	I'm not fighting what I see as a powerful,
4357740	4360380	insidious, misogynistic movement.
4360380	4363540	I do not see this particular movement
4363540	4365580	as either benign or powerless.
4365580	4368080	Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement
4368080	4372260	is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way
4372260	4375440	that makes it different from all past liberation movements.
4375440	4376500	But how?
4376500	4378500	What are these illiberal methods
4378500	4380480	that distinguish trans rights activism
4380480	4382300	from similar past movements?
4382300	4383400	Canceling?
4383400	4385460	Anita Bryant was way more canceled
4385460	4387440	than J.K. Rowling ever will be.
4387440	4388440	Boycotts?
4388440	4391080	Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement
4391080	4392240	in modern history.
4392240	4394360	Disrupting feminist meetings?
4394360	4397200	Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.
4397200	4399220	Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?
4399220	4403120	In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique
4403120	4405540	and founder of the National Organization for Women
4405540	4407640	and Second Wave Feminism in general,
4407640	4409900	coined the phrase Lavender Menace
4409900	4411660	to describe the threat she believed
4411660	4414260	that lesbians posed to the women's movement.
4414260	4417680	Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians
4417680	4419580	would make it easy to dismiss the movement
4419580	4421580	as a bunch of mannish man-haters.
4421580	4424500	This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians
4424500	4428220	who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970
4428220	4430900	to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,
4430900	4432700	a disruptive public protest
4432700	4435540	designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.
4435540	4436620	Think glitter bombing.
4436620	4437740	Think pies.
4437740	4439540	Half aggression, half whimsy.
4439540	4441260	Like that time the lesbian Avengers
4441260	4444100	zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,
4444100	4445500	demanding that she resign.
4445500	4447540	This podcast has pushed me over the edge.
4447540	4451060	Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.
4451060	4452980	So just as the meeting was beginning,
4452980	4456420	a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts
4456420	4459420	switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,
4459420	4462220	and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.
4462220	4465060	Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,
4465060	4467020	this conference won't proceed
4467020	4469740	until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.
4469740	4471900	One of the NOW organizers yelled back,
4471900	4474860	I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.
4474860	4476540	You're acting like men.
4476540	4478300	Betty Friedan would later speculate
4478300	4480660	that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP
4480660	4483140	designed to make the women's movement look bad.
4483140	4486060	So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting
4486060	4487880	using illiberal tactics,
4487880	4490020	not because they were against feminism,
4490020	4493020	but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists
4493020	4494060	to include them.
4494060	4495660	It's the same thing that's happening today
4495660	4498240	when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,
4498240	4499980	as J.K. Rowling puts it,
4499980	4501760	interestingly neglecting to mention
4501760	4503740	which feminist meetings these are.
4503740	4506060	I was starting to see activists behaving
4506060	4508840	in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.
4508840	4511660	There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging
4511660	4514340	and kicking on windows, very threatening.
4514340	4517520	There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea
4517520	4520500	that trans activists are somehow more aggressive
4520500	4522280	than similar past movements.
4522280	4524420	Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man
4524420	4526780	called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh who says,
4526780	4529020	all those gay rights and AIDS protests,
4529020	4531340	I don't remember a single one
4531340	4534300	where we intimidated or silenced a woman.
4534300	4536620	Not a single one.
4536620	4538780	Not a single one.
4538780	4540460	Not a single one.
4540460	4545460	Not a single one.
4546340	4549140	Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS
4549140	4550500	to the trans movement.
4550500	4553140	And also, quote,
4553140	4555580	I will fucking nail you to a wall
4555580	4558660	what you have done to these innocent children.
4558660	4561780	Your mutilation of these little humand
4561780	4563780	because they were gay will be nothing
4563780	4568340	compared to what I will do to you legally.
4568340	4570060	You think you are ghouls.
4570060	4573840	Wait till I deal with you, bastard, and I mean to.
4573840	4576860	Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.
4576860	4579900	I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people
4579900	4583200	to a wall count as illiberal methods?
4583200	4585260	I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so
4585260	4586800	because she's never condemned it.
4586800	4589420	In fact, when Dennis' Twitter suspension ended,
4589420	4591600	she was right there to welcome him back,
4591600	4593380	and she continues to retweet him.
4593380	4595100	I've always been happy to acknowledge
4595100	4597100	that angry trans people on Twitter
4597100	4599060	sometimes take things too far.
4599060	4602320	Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,
4602320	4605020	I don't support that, and I've called it out in the past.
4605020	4607100	Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,
4607820	4611380	drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,
4611380	4614860	women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.
4614860	4616660	I called him out, tweeting,
4616660	4620140	doing edgy ironic misogyny while defending trans people
4620140	4622740	magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say
4622740	4625600	about there being misogyny in trans activism.
4625600	4627660	I tweeted that because I recognize
4627660	4629820	that if people who are claiming to speak for you
4629820	4632140	are doing so in a misogynistic way,
4632140	4633860	and if you let that slide,
4633860	4635060	you're going to wake up one day
4635060	4637500	to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.
4637500	4639940	Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,
4639940	4641700	explaining that actually,
4641700	4645100	I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments
4645100	4648420	for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling
4648420	4650820	and then he accused me of cancel culturing him
4650820	4651820	while at the same time,
4651820	4654620	literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.
4654620	4657540	The more viewer in the replies being like,
4657540	4659020	that's not what's happening right here.
4659020	4661260	Like this is necessary, okay?
4661260	4665820	Publicly shame her into changing her mind on that.
4665820	4668300	Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.
4668300	4672220	Move you off this site and into,
4672220	4673980	I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.
4673980	4675500	So that pretty much confirms to me
4675500	4676900	that Vosh doesn't actually care
4676900	4678580	about advocating for trans people
4678580	4680940	and just uses trans rights as a pretext
4680940	4682380	to act like a fucking dingus.
4682380	4684380	I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,
4684380	4687180	because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.
4687180	4688620	The point I'm trying to make is,
4688620	4691980	I have no qualms about calling out people on my side
4691980	4694380	whenever they go too far or cross a line
4694380	4696580	or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me
4696580	4699820	about how I don't understand tactical misogyny, idiot.
4699820	4702220	But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.
4702220	4704420	I have never once seen her call out
4704420	4706540	any of the bigotry and abusiveness
4706540	4710260	that is absolutely rampant in the gender critical movement.
4710260	4713500	There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends
4713500	4716380	by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty
4716380	4720180	of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists
4720180	4722440	versus the abusive trans mob.
4722440	4725020	A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling
4725020	4727980	accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples
4727980	4731060	of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.
4731060	4734300	Things like, kill turfs 2014.
4734300	4737260	How about slowly and horrendously murder turfs
4737260	4740180	in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?
4740180	4741820	Now, I don't think anyone should joke
4741820	4743920	about putting people in saw traps,
4743920	4746560	but also, how serious is this threat
4746560	4749560	that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?
4749560	4751800	Let's use our critical thinking skills here.
4751800	4756120	Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,
4756120	4759120	has a Tumblr account and is threatening turfs?
4759120	4761680	Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?
4761680	4764600	The podcast cites zero examples of death threats
4764600	4766960	and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.
4766960	4770120	And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.
4770120	4772480	I can fill the screen up with examples
4772480	4774440	just from people who J.K. Rowling
4774440	4777200	has explicitly supported or interacted with.
4777200	4778960	I will drive you out into the desert
4778960	4781800	and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says,
4781800	4783480	from a fan of J.K. Rowling.
4783480	4784940	First, I'll set you on fire
4784940	4787080	and piss on your half-alive corpse.
4787080	4791220	Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.
4791220	4792760	Another threat from the same user
4792760	4795500	is so graphically violent and sexual,
4795500	4797480	I don't know if I can even read it aloud
4797480	4800040	without violating the YouTube terms of service.
4800040	4802560	But threats like this from the gender-critical side
4802560	4806200	are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
4806200	4808240	Both Rowling and Megan seem happy
4808240	4810320	to cherry-pick threatening tweets
4810320	4812600	and soundbites of shouting protesters.
4812600	4815080	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!
4815080	4816400	You look like you've got your teeth
4816400	4818320	knocked out of your fucking fascist!
4818320	4820040	As evidence that the trans movement
4820040	4822360	is dangerous and insidious to the core.
4822360	4824560	But this exact technique has been used
4824560	4828120	against literally every liberation movement in world history.
4828120	4831600	For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,
4831600	4834720	the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,
4834720	4836200	which first got J.K. Rowling
4836200	4838800	interested in feminism in the 1970s.
4838800	4840040	Here's how The Guardian,
4840040	4842560	Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,
4842560	4845920	covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.
4845920	4847600	Chanting slogans against rape
4847600	4849640	seems reasonable to promote awareness,
4849640	4851480	but what about the hissing and swearing
4851480	4855480	at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?
4855480	4857600	We were all sympathetic to the principles
4857600	4859480	of the women's liberation movement,
4859480	4862840	but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women,
4862840	4865320	when it became clear that my friend's brother
4865320	4868000	was running the risk of personal mutilation
4868000	4869360	if he remained with us.
4869360	4871480	The protesters were allegedly singing,
4871480	4876360	here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.
4876360	4878420	So this is how the British press
4878420	4879880	covered the women's movement.
4879880	4883760	Angry, torch-bearing women screaming, castrate men!
4883760	4886900	Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?
4886900	4888500	Should we judge every movement
4888500	4890660	by its most militant extremists?
4890660	4894460	Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanas,
4894460	4898160	who shot Andy Warhol, who advocated for male extermination
4898160	4901140	in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,
4901140	4903580	is representative of feminism as a whole?
4903580	4906980	Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.
4906980	4909220	But it's not fair, is it?
4909220	4911100	So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair
4911100	4912660	to judge the trans movement
4912660	4915220	by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?
4915220	4917420	I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
4917420	4919860	And I made excuses for you then.
4919860	4922900	In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,
4922900	4925140	Meghan interviews New York Times columnist
4925140	4927580	Michelle Goldberg, who has written sympathetically
4927580	4929220	about transphobic feminism.
4929220	4930500	There's a moment in this interview
4930500	4933940	where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation
4933940	4935620	that I find fascinating.
4935620	4938140	Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,
4938140	4941140	you know, I'm not gonna debate my basic humanity.
4941140	4942420	And part of the difficulty
4942420	4944220	is that there are indeed certain issues
4944220	4947260	which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively
4947260	4951060	with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.
4951060	4954060	And I think that part of what is so difficult
4954060	4955620	about this issue is that there are certain people
4955620	4957660	who think that this kind of consensus
4957660	4962380	can be imposed maybe as opposed to evolve organically.
4962380	4967380	And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up
4967900	4970500	in the hopes, I think, that if they can,
4970500	4975100	they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection
4975100	4977420	as other groups whose rights we've decided
4977420	4981020	are not up for public conversation.
4981020	4981860	I think the problem is that
4981860	4983500	we don't actually have a consensus.
4983500	4985420	So Michelle correctly observes
4985420	4987700	that the reason trans people are often reluctant
4987700	4989700	to debate our rights is that we want
4989700	4992220	the same assumed protections as other groups
4992220	4995260	whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.
4995260	4998180	But then Michelle suggests that trans people
4998180	5000140	have to debate our rights
5000140	5002820	because there isn't a mainstream consensus
5002820	5004220	that we deserve rights.
5004220	5007300	I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg
5007300	5010260	thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.
5010260	5012260	Like, does she think that women's suffrage
5012260	5014380	just evolved organically?
5014380	5018020	Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations
5018020	5021060	about whether women are intellectually capable of voting
5021060	5024220	until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?
5024220	5027180	No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,
5027180	5030180	sometimes violently, especially in the UK.
5030180	5031380	Like, people forget this,
5031380	5033420	maybe because they were called suffragettes,
5033420	5034900	which is kind of a cutesy name,
5034900	5037380	but the suffragettes, they murdered people.
5037380	5039260	They were suffragette terrorists.
5039260	5041820	They broke windows, they bombed churches,
5041820	5043820	they set fire to a theater.
5043820	5047100	In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill
5047100	5048220	with a horse whip.
5048220	5049460	Queen shit, honestly.
5049460	5052940	The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet
5052940	5054620	at the Prime Minister's head.
5054620	5056860	And my point is not to advocate terrorism
5057540	5059540	or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.
5059540	5061180	I think these kinds of tactics have tended
5061180	5063020	to turn people against the movement.
5063020	5064460	I don't think it's effective.
5064460	5066660	But let's not pretend that past movements
5066660	5069560	have never made demands before everyone was ready.
5069560	5071060	Because there never has been,
5071060	5074000	and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.
5074000	5076220	I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published
5076220	5079540	the Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,
5079540	5083560	and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.
5083560	5086420	So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,
5086460	5088220	and there probably never will be.
5088220	5091620	In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights
5091620	5094380	if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.
5094380	5096860	The whole reason to have rights is to protect you
5096860	5099220	from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.
5099220	5100980	I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just
5100980	5103580	politely persuade everyone to give us rights,
5103580	5106220	but the reality is, that's not how this works,
5106220	5107380	and it never has been.
5107380	5109580	Like, how do these debate me centrists
5109580	5112300	think that slavery ended in the United States?
5112300	5115980	Well, between 1861 and 1865,
5115980	5119900	there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.
5119900	5121420	See what I'm holding in my hand?
5121420	5123500	This is a high-caliber idea
5123500	5126660	that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.
5126660	5129100	Do you people think that American schools were integrated
5129100	5132140	because all the white people in the South were persuaded
5132140	5133900	that segregation is bad?
5133900	5134900	No, dum-dums.
5134900	5137320	Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne
5137320	5139260	to enforce that shit at gunpoint.
5139260	5142020	And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements
5142020	5143220	with black civil rights.
5143220	5145340	I am aware that being a white queer person
5145340	5147020	is not in any way equivalent
5147020	5149140	to living in the aftermath of slavery.
5149140	5150700	I'm just saying that there's this tendency
5150700	5153440	to sanitize history and to imagine
5153440	5155980	that progress was smooth and bloodless,
5155980	5159960	that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.
5159960	5162420	And then people get the impression that current movements
5162420	5166140	are somehow more militant than successful past movements
5166140	5167380	when they just aren't.
5167380	5171940	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,
5171940	5175540	misogynistic movement, a cultural movement
5175540	5177940	that was illiberal in its methods.
5177940	5182940	And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous
5183360	5186540	about this movement and it must be challenged.
5186540	5188420	Why is J.K. Rowling like this?
5188420	5192080	Chapter seven, why is J.K. Rowling like this?
5192080	5195700	J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,
5195700	5198700	whom I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.
5198700	5201720	I myself favor violence, deeply.
5202620	5206200	Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,
5206200	5207680	which I don't agree with.
5207680	5209520	But she was an interesting writer,
5209520	5213360	one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head,
5213360	5215080	who you can't stop thinking about.
5215080	5219320	In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right-Wing Women,
5219320	5222680	published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly
5222680	5223960	and Anita Bryant.
5223960	5227300	Right-Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women
5227300	5229560	are drawn to conservative politics,
5229560	5231920	seemingly against their own interests.
5231920	5233880	Anyone who's interested in understanding
5233880	5235560	the gender-critical movement,
5235560	5238480	a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself
5238480	5241040	as feminism, should read this book.
5241040	5242440	In Dworkin's analysis,
5242440	5244780	the political right makes certain metaphysical
5244780	5247740	and material promises to women that both exploit
5247740	5249980	and quiet some of women's deepest fears.
5249980	5252220	No one can bear to live a meaningless life.
5252220	5255320	Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.
5255320	5259080	And conservative politics promises women meaning.
5259080	5261560	The right offers women a simple, fixed,
5261560	5265200	predetermined social, biological, and sexual order.
5265200	5267000	Form conquers chaos.
5267000	5268840	Form banishes confusion.
5268840	5271240	The gender-critical movement offers women
5271240	5274540	a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.
5274540	5277960	A woman is an adult human female.
5277960	5281320	Right-wing anti-trans activist Posie Parker
5281320	5283600	has made this phrase into the motto
5283600	5285480	of the gender-critical movement.
5285480	5288760	Adult human female.
5288760	5291200	It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts,
5291200	5294240	it's on banners, signs, and tweets.
5294240	5297440	Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,
5297440	5301080	it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.
5301080	5304340	There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,
5304340	5306600	there can be no change.
5306600	5310640	This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability
5310640	5313160	and chaos that gender-criticals fear.
5313160	5316000	The same fear that once drove homophobic women
5316000	5317480	like Anita Bryant.
5317480	5319560	It's just biologically that God made mothers
5319560	5320760	so that we could reproduce.
5320760	5323800	Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.
5323800	5327160	Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability
5327160	5330320	of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.
5330320	5331520	Dworkin says,
5331520	5333440	Within the frame of male domination,
5333440	5336320	there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,
5336320	5337800	both male and female.
5337800	5340520	Women are interchangeable as sex objects.
5340520	5343280	Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.
5343280	5346280	The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.
5346280	5348680	Having children is the one social contribution
5348680	5350060	credited to women.
5350060	5352680	It is the bedrock of women's social worth.
5352680	5355440	Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.
5355440	5357920	Homosexuality for women means having nothing,
5357920	5359600	it means extinction.
5359600	5363180	Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality
5363180	5365880	and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.
5365880	5369440	J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.
5369440	5373440	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
5373440	5376520	The producer of the large gametes.
5376520	5380560	Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men
5380560	5382840	is the loss of fertility.
5382840	5386440	Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,
5386440	5389680	attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,
5389680	5391360	makes women expendable.
5391360	5393840	The one thing women can do and be valued for
5393840	5395640	will no longer be valued.
5395640	5398460	Male homosexuality is especially terrifying
5398460	5401840	because it suggests a world without women altogether,
5401840	5403960	a world in which women are extinct.
5403960	5406800	This exact fear appears frequently
5406800	5408400	in gender-critical rhetoric.
5408400	5410920	Trans activists are erasing women.
5410920	5413520	They're erasing biological sex.
5413520	5416400	They're going to call us pregnant people.
5416400	5420160	Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.
5420160	5423560	Trans women are going to replace biological women.
5423560	5426680	As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men
5426680	5428520	are aggressively replacing women.
5428520	5430400	You will not replace us!
5430400	5433920	Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession
5433920	5436440	and the results can be dazzling.
5436440	5439440	In September 2022, Maya Forstater,
5439440	5441920	who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist
5441920	5444880	whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,
5444880	5447120	went on a full-blown Twitter rampage
5447120	5449720	because the Hertfordshire County Libraries
5449720	5452040	announced they were changing their children's
5452040	5455640	storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear,
5455640	5457040	if you don't know where this is going,
5457040	5459720	strap in from the Bookstart Bear
5459720	5464720	to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.
5466200	5468280	Are you enraged?
5468280	5472000	If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.
5472000	5474480	Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother
5474480	5477160	who referred to Talia, wait, wasn't it Tala?
5477160	5481840	Referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns.
5481840	5484880	Describing the mascot as ideological,
5484920	5487160	creepy, and gaslighting.
5487160	5490920	I cannot express how upset I feel.
5490920	5494800	The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia,
5494800	5497440	isn't trans, they are an alien.
5497440	5501200	Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.
5501200	5504800	Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?
5504800	5506840	Some people tried to reason with Maya.
5506840	5508520	There's an advantage in having a character
5508520	5510720	that isn't identifiably male or female,
5510720	5513000	as it can be equally relatable to either sex
5513000	5515200	and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.
5515200	5517480	But Maya was not convinced.
5517480	5519960	It seems highly unlikely that an alien
5519960	5523520	that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan
5523520	5525480	is not sexually reproducing.
5525480	5528000	It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,
5528000	5530400	not a slime mold.
5530400	5535280	I need to know how the alien fucks right now.
5535280	5540200	I said I need to know how the alien fucks
5540200	5543640	before I can show it to my child.
5543640	5548640	When Twitter, understandably, laughed it up
5549080	5552480	at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.
5552480	5553600	And she posted hard.
5553600	5555320	Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen
5555320	5556640	anyone post so hard.
5556640	5558880	In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about
5558880	5560880	the miseries of new motherhood.
5560880	5562680	You are in charge of a baby.
5562680	5564280	You have never done this before.
5564280	5566440	You haven't had a good night's sleep for months
5566440	5567640	and won't for years.
5567640	5569640	Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing
5569640	5572200	right and wrong, and you've become invisible.
5572200	5573640	You had politics.
5573640	5574960	You had a career.
5574960	5576520	You had interests.
5576520	5577960	You had a sex life.
5577960	5579520	Now, you have the daily needs
5579520	5581360	of a completely dependent person,
5581360	5583000	and your world has shrunk.
5583000	5585800	The fact that these men and the young women
5585800	5588760	that cheer them on think this is so laughable
5588760	5591440	reflects society's disdain for mothers.
5591440	5592880	This is what it means to say
5592880	5595240	a woman is not a feeling or a costume.
5595240	5599120	This is why the hub of the resistance is on Mumsnet.
5599120	5602280	So, I am fascinated by this thread.
5602280	5604480	I think it's one of the most revealing texts
5604480	5606000	in gender-critical history.
5606000	5607400	Because you know what?
5607400	5611920	Maya Forstater actually does have valid concerns.
5611920	5614280	But the concerns she has that are valid
5614280	5616480	have nothing to do with trans people.
5616480	5618680	And they definitely have nothing to do
5618680	5621480	with an adorable cartoon alien.
5621480	5624880	Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.
5624880	5628480	Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?
5628480	5629960	I know she has one.
5629960	5633320	Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?
5633320	5637040	No one should have to feel this alone, raising children.
5637040	5639200	That is a valid concern.
5639200	5640840	Oh my God, we actually found one.
5640840	5642520	It's like finding El Dorado.
5642520	5644240	A valid concern.
5644240	5646240	A valid concern.
5646240	5647520	Isn't what's going on here
5647520	5649680	that Maya is taking legitimate feelings
5649680	5652440	of being overburdened and underappreciated
5652440	5655520	and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?
5655520	5658720	This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits,
5658720	5662280	by providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.
5662280	5664040	It's not your husband's neglect.
5664040	5666920	It's not the increasing atomization of society.
5666920	5669120	It's not the indignities of aging.
5669120	5672680	It's Tala, the non-binary alien,
5672680	5676840	with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.
5676840	5681520	Mumsnet is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.
5681520	5683120	It's too much, these people are too much.
5683120	5684700	Okay, we have to be serious now.
5684700	5688940	The political right also promises women safety and security.
5688940	5691740	For women, the world is a very dangerous place.
5691740	5694220	The right acknowledges the reality of danger,
5694220	5695700	the validity of fear.
5695700	5697780	The right then manipulates the fear.
5697780	5700180	Women fear and resent male violence,
5700180	5702220	which they're most likely to experience
5702220	5704340	from the men closest to them,
5704340	5706980	boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.
5706980	5709740	They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.
5709740	5713180	But the need to survive in a male-dominated society
5713180	5716140	means that women's legitimate fears and resentments
5716140	5719700	often cannot be directed at the men with power.
5719700	5722500	Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage
5722500	5726100	and contempt they feel for the men who actually abuse them,
5726100	5729420	those close to them, and project it onto others,
5729420	5732540	those far away, foreign, or different.
5732540	5734460	And this displacement of rage
5734460	5738100	is just transparently what's going on with J.K. Rowling.
5738100	5741220	In her essay about sex and gender issues,
5741220	5744660	Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning
5744660	5747220	to be the son her father wanted.
5747220	5749220	I really felt the rejection of my father,
5749220	5750380	and that is one of the things
5750380	5753220	that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.
5753220	5755500	And she describes the lingering trauma
5755500	5757700	from her first violent marriage.
5757700	5760020	The marriage at this point has turned very violent
5760020	5761380	and very controlling.
5761380	5765180	And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out
5765180	5767940	against the transgender movement.
5767940	5770540	If you try to understand this rationally,
5770540	5772700	it looks like a total non sequitur.
5772700	5774660	But if you look at it emotionally,
5774660	5776420	there's a kind of logic to it.
5776420	5778540	The existence of the dangerous outsider
5778540	5780860	always functions for women simultaneously
5780860	5784700	as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.
5784700	5786700	Women cling to irrational hatreds
5786700	5789220	focused particularly on the unfamiliar
5789220	5791180	so that they will not murder their fathers,
5791180	5793620	husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,
5793620	5795500	the men with whom they are intimate,
5795500	5797380	those who do hurt them.
5797380	5800380	In the 1970s, many conservative women
5801220	5803060	displaced this rage onto lesbians,
5803060	5805220	the threatening outsider of the day.
5805220	5809340	Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,
5809340	5811220	where she spoke to a lot of women
5811220	5813580	about their fear of lesbians.
5813580	5816380	Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians
5816380	5818220	as if lesbians were rapists,
5818220	5820300	certified committers of sexual assault
5820300	5821580	against women and girls.
5821580	5824940	To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,
5824940	5827980	experienced almost as a demonic sexual force
5827980	5829940	hovering closer and closer.
5829940	5833460	She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching,
5833460	5836220	threatening by her very presence a sexual order
5836220	5839460	that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.
5839460	5841340	It's almost surreal to read this
5841340	5844260	because of how precisely it describes
5844260	5847020	how gender-criticals talk about trans women.
5847020	5848860	Pronouns are like Rohypnol.
5848860	5850340	They dull your defenses.
5850340	5852180	They change your inhibitions.
5852180	5853100	They're meant to.
5853100	5856940	Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism
5856940	5861180	began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,
5861180	5865700	with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979
5865700	5869180	that transsexualism should be morally mandated
5869180	5870620	out of existence.
5870620	5871980	But the gender-critical movement
5871980	5875380	was always destined to become a right-wing movement
5875380	5878700	because it has the structure of a right-wing movement,
5878700	5881900	taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men
5881900	5885500	and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.
5885500	5889100	The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity
5889100	5891020	for conservatives to pass up.
5891020	5892060	As Dworkin says,
5892060	5894380	Because women so displace their rage,
5894380	5897700	they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.
5897700	5901260	Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.
5901260	5903420	The right provides these symbols of danger
5903420	5906380	by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders
5906380	5907900	as sources of danger.
5907900	5912180	In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone
5912180	5915540	of conservative party platforms, both in the UK,
5915540	5916820	where Lee Anderson,
5916820	5918940	deputy chair of the Conservative Party,
5918940	5921380	predicts that the next election will be won on
5924380	5925740	and in the US,
5925740	5927980	where the ACLU is currently tracking
5927980	5931620	more than 450 anti-LGBT bills,
5931620	5935180	including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,
5935180	5939020	51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans,
5939020	5940940	29 trans bathroom bans,
5940940	5944540	and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.
5944540	5947580	Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric
5947580	5949620	to eliminationist extremes
5949620	5952100	that have most trans people in this country
5952100	5955060	living in a constant state of fear for our future.
5955060	5958140	Transgenderism must be eradicated
5958140	5960380	from public life entirely.
5960380	5962500	The left is attacking our children,
5962500	5965900	pushing sex talk, transgender extremism,
5965900	5968380	and noxious politics in our schools.
5968380	5970740	We should reject this demonic assault
5970740	5972580	on the innocence of our children
5972580	5975060	and stand fast against leftist efforts
5975060	5977460	to mutilate their bodies and minds.
5977460	5979980	Stop confusing our babies
5979980	5983820	with your groomer gender ideologue.
5983820	5986420	I will revoke every Biden policy
5986420	5988780	promoting the chemical castration
5988780	5992540	and sexual mutilization of our youth.
5992540	5997300	And ask Congress to send me a bill
5997300	6001180	prohibiting child sexual mutilation
6001180	6002900	in all 50 states.
6002900	6007340	On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies
6007340	6010220	on so-called gender-affirming care.
6010220	6011140	Ridiculous.
6011140	6013100	I will sign a new executive order
6013100	6015100	instructing every federal agency
6015100	6017100	to cease all programs
6017100	6019340	that promote the concept of sex
6019340	6022100	and gender transition at any age.
6022100	6025340	A few gender-criticals still want to insist
6025340	6026900	they have nothing to do
6026900	6029180	with right-wing anti-trans bigots,
6029180	6030340	like Helen Lewis.
6030340	6032020	I mean, TERF is basically which.
6032020	6033540	Who attempts in her interview
6033540	6035540	in The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling
6035540	6038700	to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right
6038700	6040420	and that of feminists.
6040420	6042580	I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand
6042580	6045060	is that there are two different arguments going on.
6045060	6048340	One is the traditional conservative right argument,
6048340	6050060	which is anti-LGBT.
6050060	6052500	The other one is a criticism from the left
6052500	6054260	in which it says,
6054260	6056900	sometimes male people and female people
6056900	6058540	have different interests,
6058540	6060700	no matter how the male people identify.
6060700	6063220	But as a trans person, I don't care
6063220	6065100	whether you justify your transphobia
6065100	6068580	in the name of protecting women or protecting children.
6068580	6070900	Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond
6070900	6072500	calling for transsexualism
6072500	6075260	to be morally mandated out of existence,
6075260	6077660	or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles
6077660	6079260	calling for transgenderism
6079260	6081380	to be eradicated from public life,
6081380	6083940	is the same repulsive bigotry to me.
6083940	6086700	And in any case, the gender critical movement
6086700	6089820	has recently reached an implicit consensus
6089820	6092820	that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.
6092820	6095580	The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker,
6095580	6098020	aka Kelly J. Keene-Menschel,
6098020	6100140	rejects feminism entirely.
6100140	6102060	Do you call yourself a feminist now?
6102060	6102900	No.
6102900	6103740	Did you ever call yourself a feminist?
6103740	6105420	I probably did for a short time.
6105420	6106660	But so you wouldn't be said
6106660	6108740	like a Julie Bindle type feminist?
6108740	6109900	No, well, some feminists,
6109900	6113380	I mean, Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers
6113380	6115700	in the past, and I think that's a theme
6115700	6116940	flowing through feminism.
6116940	6118460	I'm not a feminist!
6118460	6119740	I'm not a feminist!
6119740	6122260	This is not Andrea Dworkin.
6122260	6123980	This is Phyllis Schlafly.
6123980	6125980	Parker's campaign is currently funded
6125980	6127620	by the right-wing CPAC.
6127620	6130820	CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events
6130820	6135140	and cover all of our insurance throughout our whole trip,
6135140	6137500	which is really kind of them.
6137500	6138940	But what we would need to do
6138940	6141340	is we would need to show that we were working for them,
6141340	6142860	working with them.
6142860	6144940	She has no qualms about collaborating
6144940	6146940	with far-right white nationalists.
6146940	6149340	I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.
6149340	6150820	Let me tell you what she's been saying.
6150820	6155660	She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.
6155660	6158740	She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.
6158740	6162220	Why are we enabling children
6162220	6167220	to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful
6167540	6169340	or access to abortion?
6170340	6174540	I think that we really need to rethink all of this.
6174540	6177220	I think parents need to take back control of their children.
6177220	6180180	She's called trans people fools and perverts.
6180180	6183220	Transgenderism is nuts.
6183220	6185460	It's for fools and perverts.
6185460	6188940	She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.
6188940	6190420	It's not a real thing.
6190420	6192780	There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.
6192780	6194260	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
6194260	6196420	There's no such thing as a trans person.
6196420	6197420	There is no such thing.
6197420	6200300	There are people that call themselves these things
6200300	6203580	that may have other issues manifesting
6203580	6205660	that then make them think they're this, but no.
6205660	6208460	We have to stop using any words like transgender.
6209460	6211180	There may be more words that we have to say
6211180	6212100	in order to say that.
6212100	6214460	We may call it transgender ideology,
6214460	6215980	but when it comes to a person,
6215980	6218460	they may be following transgender ideology,
6218460	6220020	but they are not transgender.
6220020	6222540	There is no such thing as a man or a woman
6222540	6224740	being anything other than a man or a woman.
6224740	6227260	She's called trans women pedophiles.
6227260	6229700	We know that if a man has a paraphilia
6229700	6231380	of dressing as a woman,
6231380	6236020	the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.
6236020	6239900	We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.
6239900	6241540	They don't ever stop at one.
6241540	6243500	She's said that each and every woman
6243500	6246740	who stands in her way will be annihilated.
6246740	6250380	Each and every one of you women who stand in my way,
6250380	6251860	each and every one of you,
6251860	6254660	let me just tell you, you will be annihilated.
6255580	6258780	She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms
6258780	6262380	to attack anyone they perceive as not a real woman.
6262380	6266340	And men, for once, I'm talking to you.
6267620	6272620	I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry,
6272940	6274540	I think that's what you say.
6274540	6276460	I'm so done with the American lingo.
6276460	6278900	Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.
6278900	6281740	Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.
6281740	6284260	Maybe you're that sort of man.
6284580	6287220	Maybe you have a sister or a mother or a wife.
6287220	6289300	Maybe you have a sister, maybe you just have some friends.
6289300	6291940	Maybe you just think women are human
6291940	6295380	and you don't need any absolute connection with them
6295380	6297940	to feel compelled to protect us.
6300300	6302660	I think you should start using women's toilets, men.
6302660	6306180	And she's said that women who call themselves men
6306180	6307900	should be sterilized,
6307900	6310340	which seems to be a little bit in tension
6310340	6312500	with J.K. Rowling's concern
6312500	6315380	about the fertility of confused girls.
6315380	6318100	You know, you might look at these differences of opinion
6318100	6319780	between Rowling and Parker,
6319780	6323660	little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist,
6323660	6327620	left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,
6327620	6330300	concern about trans men's fertility
6330300	6334420	versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men,
6334420	6337380	against annihilating women who stand in your way
6337380	6342140	versus pro-annihilating each and every woman
6342140	6343820	who stands in your way.
6343820	6345180	You might look at these differences
6345180	6348100	and expect that these two women would be at odds,
6348100	6349100	but they aren't.
6349100	6353020	Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause
6353020	6356220	that for both of them trumps all else.
6356220	6358980	In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster
6358980	6361140	reading I heart J.K. Rowling
6361140	6363940	to be displayed at a railway station in Edinburgh.
6363940	6367700	And Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times
6367700	6369980	and has modeled her t-shirts.
6369980	6372820	So the gender critical movement
6372820	6376140	started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s
6376140	6380300	has finally passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns,
6380300	6382820	as gender critical lesbian, Julie Bindle,
6382820	6384540	memorably described them.
6384540	6386860	It's a movement that has no beliefs
6386860	6389140	apart from a shared determination
6389140	6391540	to reduce the number of trans people.
6391540	6393180	In the numbers we're currently seeing,
6393180	6396020	particularly of young people coming forward,
6396020	6397660	I find cause for doubt.
6397700	6399020	In the meantime,
6399020	6401580	while we're trying to get through to the decision makers,
6401580	6403900	we have to try to limit the harm.
6403900	6406500	And that means reducing or keeping down
6406500	6407900	the number of people who transition.
6407900	6410020	And that's for two reasons.
6410020	6411940	One of them is that every one of those people
6411940	6414180	is a person who's been damaged.
6414180	6416900	But the second one is every one of those people
6416900	6421900	is basically, you know, a huge problem to a sane world.
6422300	6423820	Like if you've got people,
6423820	6424780	whether they're transitioned,
6424780	6425900	whether they're happily transitioned,
6425900	6427140	whether they're unhappily transitioned,
6427140	6428780	whether they're de-transitioned,
6428780	6430420	if you've got people who've dissociated
6430420	6432780	from their sex in some way,
6432780	6433740	every one of those people
6433740	6436140	is someone who needs special accommodation
6436140	6439980	in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of sex.
6439980	6441700	So to wrap this up,
6441700	6445340	is the backlash against J.K. Rowling a witch hunt?
6446420	6448020	Unequivocally, no.
6448020	6450340	It's very thoroughly deserved.
6450340	6451740	But I will say this,
6451740	6454500	a movement can't get along without a devil.
6454500	6456900	And across the whole political spectrum,
6457660	6461220	there's a misogynistic tendency to choose a female devil,
6461220	6464220	whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton,
6464220	6469220	Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or J.K. Rowling.
6469340	6470820	And there's always gonna be people
6470820	6474300	who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.
6474300	6477980	So I would advise trans people and our allies
6477980	6480540	to keep in mind that J.K. Rowling
6480540	6483500	is not the final boss of transphobia.
6483500	6485100	She's not our devil.
6485140	6488940	The devil is the Republican Party, the conservative party.
6488940	6490940	The devil is patriarchy.
6490940	6493460	It's the right-wing men who will be the ones
6493460	6497220	to put gender-critical theory into brutal practice.
6497220	6501300	Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and J.K. Rowling are,
6501300	6504460	to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.
6504460	6506220	TERFs are the real handmaidens.
6506220	6509820	They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face
6509820	6512700	on the patriarchal violence against trans people
6512700	6515900	that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.
6515900	6520340	I call on men to consider themselves decent human beings
6520340	6522780	to call out the deviants among them
6522780	6526780	and eradicate these monsters from society.
6526780	6530820	And Megan Phelps Roper and Centra Slayker are wrong
6530820	6534100	that civil conversation can resolve this.
6534100	6536340	Call out the deviants among them
6536340	6540420	and eradicate these monsters from society.
6540420	6543540	People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis
6543540	6546540	and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.
6546540	6548580	They have to be defeated.
6548580	6551300	As for what to do about J.K. Rowling,
6551300	6554300	honestly, let's all just block her.
6554300	6556820	Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile,
6556820	6558140	and just block her.
6558140	6559340	Problem solved.
6559340	6561500	Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.
6561500	6564100	But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.
6564100	6567060	She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.
6567060	6569740	The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave.
6569740	6572820	For the same reasons that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.
6572820	6575100	To quote video essayist Dan Olson,
6575100	6578140	One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam
6578140	6580700	is that the victims who invested the most
6580700	6583020	are often the most passionate defenders
6583020	6586380	because shame is a powerful force in the human psyche
6586380	6589420	and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.
6589420	6591020	Reformed bigots have to face
6591020	6593220	not only the shame of being dupes,
6593220	6595860	but also the guilt of having devoted years of life
6595860	6597660	to harming vulnerable people.
6597660	6600820	This is something Megan, to her credit, phased head on.
6600820	6604020	If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life
6604020	6607340	industriously sowing doom, discord, and rage
6607340	6611700	to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.
6611700	6613980	I had wasted my life only to fill others
6613980	6615780	with pain and misery.
6615780	6619860	Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.
6619860	6622540	It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linehan,
6622540	6624620	whose all-consuming hatred of trans people
6624620	6627180	has ruined his life, cost him his marriage,
6627700	6629060	and left him alone to tweet about
6629060	6631940	destroying gender ideology minutes before midnight
6631940	6635100	on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled
6635100	6637320	to insist with ever more certainty
6637320	6640140	that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,
6640140	6642300	but are all demonic perverts,
6642300	6644620	and enemies so hyperbolically evil
6644620	6647420	that they justify his self-immolating crusade.
6648500	6650700	They took everything from me, you know.
6652060	6656060	They took my family, you know?
6656060	6657580	And I just said, no, hang on a sec.
6657580	6659740	Stop calling these women TERFs.
6659740	6662660	Stop sending them abuse.
6662660	6664020	Let them speak.
6664020	6667340	And for that, they just destroyed me.
6667340	6669860	Do you honestly feel destroyed?
6669860	6672020	No, because the one thing about this,
6672020	6674380	the one thing about this that keeps me going
6674380	6676820	is that I know I'm right, you know?
6676820	6677700	I know I'm right.
6677700	6680980	As long as he stays here in the bottom of the whirlpool,
6680980	6683740	he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships
6683740	6687620	and wasted years of life because he just couldn't let it go.
6687620	6690380	And if J.K. Rowling doesn't log off soon,
6690380	6692620	this will likely be her fate as well.
6694260	6696460	I guess what I'm really trying to say is,
6696460	6698460	Harry Potter's dead to me.
6698460	6700460	I'm switching to Twilight.
