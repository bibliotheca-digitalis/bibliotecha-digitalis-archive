WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Sar, I'm gonna talk about Joe Roe once again.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.360
But first, story time.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.680
Chapter one, Anita.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.800
The most famous bigot in American LGBT history

00:15.800 --> 00:18.240
is a woman called Anita Bryant.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.120
This is her story.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.540
1977 was not a good time to be gay.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.920
Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

00:27.920 --> 00:32.920
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights

00:33.740 --> 00:35.240
into national consciousness.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.060
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970,

00:38.060 --> 00:41.320
and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association

00:41.320 --> 00:44.100
declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.940
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference

00:46.940 --> 00:50.380
and shouted, gay conversion therapy is torture.

00:50.380 --> 00:54.940
We have abnormal urges, and we will not be silenced.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.960
Because that's the only way to get anything done

00:57.960 --> 01:00.420
in this country, you have to be super annoying about it.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.660
They give you no choice.

01:01.660 --> 01:05.740
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida,

01:05.740 --> 01:08.640
known for such popular cities as Miami,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.600
approved a law that added the phrase

01:10.600 --> 01:13.020
affectional or sexual preference

01:13.020 --> 01:15.000
to its nondiscrimination ordinance,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.940
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination

01:17.940 --> 01:20.000
on the basis of sexual orientation.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

01:24.020 --> 01:26.900
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.220
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

01:30.220 --> 01:32.140
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman

01:32.140 --> 01:34.900
who once had a career as a pop singer, beauty queen,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.700
and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.220
♪ Come to the Florida sunshine tree ♪

01:41.220 --> 01:44.020
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida

01:44.020 --> 01:45.180
any time of day.

01:45.180 --> 01:46.740
Orange juice from Florida!

01:46.740 --> 01:48.900
It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

01:48.900 --> 01:52.340
♪ Orange juice with natural vitamin C ♪

01:52.360 --> 01:55.840
♪ From the Florida sunshine tree ♪

01:55.840 --> 01:58.640
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

01:58.640 --> 02:02.040
A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.480
Breakfast without orange juice

02:03.480 --> 02:05.600
is like a day without sunshine.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.440
Cute.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.120
When Anita heard her pastor speak

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
about this nondiscrimination ordinance,

02:10.120 --> 02:13.680
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.520
How touching.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.960
According to the word of God,

02:15.960 --> 02:19.960
it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.020
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

02:23.020 --> 02:26.100
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner, saying,

02:26.100 --> 02:28.300
As a concerned mother of four children,

02:28.300 --> 02:31.380
I am most definitely against this ordinance amendment.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.420
I have never condoned nor taught my children

02:33.420 --> 02:35.320
discrimination against anyone.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.380
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

02:38.380 --> 02:41.820
you will, in fact, be infringing upon my rights

02:41.820 --> 02:44.760
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

02:44.760 --> 02:46.780
to teach my children God's moral code

02:46.780 --> 02:48.660
as stated in the holy scriptures.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.960
Anita, kill your shitty child.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.440
When the amendment passed,

02:52.440 --> 02:54.840
Anita created a campaign for its repeal,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.760
the Save Our Children Coalition,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.800
which sponsored provocative TV ads

02:59.800 --> 03:02.040
implying that gay people are degenerates

03:02.040 --> 03:04.920
who ruin communities and seduce children.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.600
The campaign has been vicious.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.880
With television commercials,

03:07.880 --> 03:09.760
the Save Our Children group is appealing

03:09.760 --> 03:11.560
to parental anxieties,

03:11.560 --> 03:14.000
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality

03:14.000 --> 03:15.800
before impressionable children.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.220
The Orange Bowl Parade,

03:17.220 --> 03:20.620
Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.900
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

03:23.900 --> 03:25.740
it's a parade of homosexuals,

03:25.740 --> 03:28.700
men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.140
Save Our Children sparked the first organized backlash

03:32.140 --> 03:34.220
to gay rights in the United States,

03:34.220 --> 03:37.140
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.740
On one side were the gay rights activists

03:39.740 --> 03:41.180
who argued that non-discrimination

03:41.180 --> 03:42.860
was a matter of human rights.

03:42.860 --> 03:45.540
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued

03:46.280 --> 03:47.120
that the non-discrimination ordinance

03:47.120 --> 03:50.680
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.040
We all believe in human rights,

03:52.040 --> 03:54.800
but we don't believe human rights

03:54.800 --> 03:56.480
that would corrupt our children

03:56.480 --> 03:59.600
or for individuals to have special privileges

03:59.600 --> 04:01.840
that would go against the constitutional rights

04:01.840 --> 04:03.120
of normal America.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.240
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

04:05.240 --> 04:07.080
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.880
In other words, gay people already have equal rights,

04:09.880 --> 04:12.120
just as long as they stay in the closet

04:12.120 --> 04:13.840
and don't do anything gay.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.980
That's very helpful.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.500
Thank you so much, Anita,

04:18.500 --> 04:23.500
for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.700
As long as they do their job

04:25.700 --> 04:27.140
and do not want to come out of the closet

04:27.140 --> 04:29.820
and force their homosexuality on me

04:29.820 --> 04:32.220
in the areas of business or in the schools,

04:32.220 --> 04:34.100
they can live their life,

04:34.100 --> 04:36.300
and we're not going out after their jobs

04:36.300 --> 04:39.060
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

04:39.060 --> 04:42.620
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals

04:42.620 --> 04:46.440
to teach children was tantamount to gay recruitment.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.520
Just biologically, that God made mothers

04:48.520 --> 04:49.720
so that we could reproduce.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.080
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

04:53.080 --> 04:56.720
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.240
It's the exact same argument that's being used today

04:59.240 --> 05:00.520
by right-wing politicians

05:00.520 --> 05:03.040
who claim that queer people are groomers.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.520
Stop confusing our babies

05:05.520 --> 05:09.160
with your groomer gender ideologue.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.600
This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.420
Sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books,

05:16.420 --> 05:17.980
and she believes in traditional marriage

05:17.980 --> 05:19.060
between a man and a woman,

05:19.060 --> 05:21.020
and in that book, it talked about two moms.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.500
Stay away from the children creep, or you will regret it.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.820
People should definitely arm themselves.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.660
I agree with that.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.620
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.900
The Democrats are the party of teachers,

05:31.900 --> 05:33.180
elementary school teachers,

05:33.180 --> 05:37.260
trying to transition their elementary school-age children

05:37.260 --> 05:39.300
and convince them they're a different gender.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.380
They're just evil people, and they want to groom kids.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.800
They're recruiting.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.040
If you don't know what furries are,

05:45.040 --> 05:48.960
it's where school children dress up as animals,

05:48.960 --> 05:52.520
cats or dogs, during the school day.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.920
They meow and they bark.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.160
What a great country we live in.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.040
I love it so much.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.360
Gay people around the country

06:00.360 --> 06:03.280
rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.120
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,

06:06.120 --> 06:09.080
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

06:09.080 --> 06:11.080
and replacing them with an apple juice

06:11.100 --> 06:14.020
and vodka cocktail called Anita Bryant.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.060
Let's make one now.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.180
Forgot my cocktail measure,

06:17.180 --> 06:19.660
so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

06:19.660 --> 06:21.460
Just a dash of apple juice.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.860
Give it a stir.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.420
Needs a garnish.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.260
Stunning.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.780
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver,

06:30.780 --> 06:32.780
but if I was in the 70s,

06:32.780 --> 06:34.940
I would've thrown back so many of these goddamn things

06:34.940 --> 06:36.620
out of pure spite.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.300
There's a story that Troy Perry,

06:38.300 --> 06:39.860
the founder of the gay-affirming

06:39.880 --> 06:41.800
Metropolitan Community Church,

06:41.800 --> 06:43.840
was on a transcontinental flight,

06:43.840 --> 06:45.680
and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice

06:45.680 --> 06:46.920
on his tray, he said,

06:46.920 --> 06:49.760
take that away, I'm a homosexual.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.240
At gay pride marches in 1977 and 78,

06:53.240 --> 06:55.880
anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently

06:55.880 --> 06:58.080
on T-shirts, signs, and buttons.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.320
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.800
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.640
True.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.480
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired

07:06.480 --> 07:08.400
more anti-gay legislation,

07:08.400 --> 07:11.460
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage,

07:11.460 --> 07:13.600
both of which passed in the Florida Senate,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.640
as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California,

07:16.640 --> 07:19.880
which would've forced public schools to fire gay teachers.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.980
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.940
She was an influential bigot.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.040
But she may also have helped to unify

07:26.040 --> 07:28.080
and galvanize gay activists

07:28.080 --> 07:30.200
by providing them with a common enemy.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.400
According to historian Lillian Federman,

07:32.400 --> 07:34.880
Anita Bryant created fervent activists

07:34.880 --> 07:36.820
out of those who'd previously been content

07:36.820 --> 07:39.260
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.620
Federman cites Eric Hoffer's observation

07:41.620 --> 07:44.780
that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,

07:44.780 --> 07:47.060
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.020
For gay people all over the country,

07:49.020 --> 07:51.460
Anita Bryant became that devil.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.660
I think that she is rallying the community together

07:54.660 --> 07:56.180
like I have never seen before.

07:56.180 --> 07:57.980
There's no way I could've done it on my own.

07:57.980 --> 08:00.620
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal

08:00.620 --> 08:02.900
to repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance,

08:02.900 --> 08:05.380
there is no question that in the long term,

08:05.380 --> 08:07.220
Anita Bryant was the loser.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.740
She took a lot of Ls.

08:08.740 --> 08:09.580
Rip.

08:09.580 --> 08:10.780
That must be super hard for her.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.780
For the short remainder of her career,

08:12.780 --> 08:15.140
gay activists protested her events,

08:15.140 --> 08:16.860
they shut down the tour for her book

08:16.860 --> 08:19.980
about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

08:19.980 --> 08:22.280
and they succeeded in turning public opinion

08:22.280 --> 08:24.220
against Anita Bryant to the point

08:24.220 --> 08:26.380
that she became virtually unemployable

08:26.380 --> 08:27.940
in mainstream entertainment.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.380
And a help that she came across

08:29.380 --> 08:31.180
as kind of a judgmental prude

08:31.180 --> 08:32.900
that even hip straight people

08:32.900 --> 08:35.100
didn't want to be associated with.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.700
Our top story tonight,

08:36.700 --> 08:39.180
Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress

08:39.180 --> 08:41.060
and orange juice promoter,

08:41.060 --> 08:43.500
performed coitus in public yesterday

08:43.500 --> 08:46.980
and started a campaign to promote heterosexuality.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.900
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.980
Like she famously told Playboy magazine.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.380
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

08:54.380 --> 08:55.980
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit

08:55.980 --> 08:57.220
of the tree of life.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.100
God referred to men as trees

08:59.100 --> 09:01.700
and because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit,

09:01.700 --> 09:02.980
which is male sperm.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.300
Oh my God.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.740
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.460
This is how you lose the culture war.

09:08.460 --> 09:12.860
♪ So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita ♪

09:12.860 --> 09:15.660
♪ That's the energy we're surrounded by ♪

09:15.660 --> 09:18.220
And of course, there was the famous incident

09:18.220 --> 09:21.020
where a gay activist smashed a banana cream pie

09:21.020 --> 09:23.420
in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.700
And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia

09:25.700 --> 09:30.220
and were met with protest and all kinds of problems.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.060
And every-

09:32.100 --> 09:32.940
Oh!

09:34.340 --> 09:35.660
Security agents, security agents.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.660
No, no, let him stay.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.180
No. Let him stay.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.060
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

09:40.060 --> 09:42.060
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated

09:42.060 --> 09:44.740
the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998

09:44.740 --> 09:48.260
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

09:48.260 --> 09:52.660
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face

09:52.660 --> 09:56.220
when her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

09:56.220 --> 09:57.900
announcing her marriage to a woman

09:57.900 --> 10:00.940
and publicly struggling with whether to even invite

10:00.940 --> 10:02.620
her grandmother to the ceremony.

10:02.620 --> 10:06.220
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that

10:06.220 --> 10:08.180
like an integral part of your identity

10:08.180 --> 10:11.540
is just an evil delusion.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.620
That it is, Sarah.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.420
That it is.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.300
So that's the story of Anita Bryant

10:17.300 --> 10:19.820
as students of LGBT history know it.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.260
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

10:22.260 --> 10:25.660
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

10:25.660 --> 10:29.700
The Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.420
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

10:32.420 --> 10:33.740
A plague on both their houses.

10:33.740 --> 10:37.020
Isn't it cruel even to slur Anita

10:37.020 --> 10:39.060
as a bigot and a homophobe?

10:39.060 --> 10:42.340
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

10:42.340 --> 10:45.380
was the real victim?

10:47.780 --> 10:48.700
Oh no.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.540
Oh no!

10:53.300 --> 10:54.380
I can't do this anymore.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.220
I'm eating my pie.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.580
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

10:56.580 --> 10:59.980
Chapter two, The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

10:59.980 --> 11:00.820
God help us all.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.180
The mainstream media would have us believe

11:04.180 --> 11:06.940
that Anita Bryant is a so-called homophobe,

11:06.940 --> 11:09.060
some kind of hateful bigot.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.340
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic

11:11.340 --> 11:13.860
used to silence valid concerns?

11:13.860 --> 11:16.700
Mothers in this country are worried about their children

11:16.700 --> 11:19.460
going to school to be taught by perverts.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.380
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals

11:22.380 --> 11:24.580
weren't the real bigots?

11:24.580 --> 11:26.860
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant

11:26.860 --> 11:29.300
was the first victim of cancel culture,

11:29.300 --> 11:32.940
of, dare I say it, wokeism?

11:32.940 --> 11:35.140
Well, no, that's the dumbest thing

11:35.140 --> 11:36.700
I've ever heard in my entire life.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.340
But suppose that you're an idiot,

11:38.340 --> 11:41.020
and suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.940
Well, what would be your argument?

11:42.940 --> 11:44.500
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head

11:44.500 --> 11:46.460
and forced me to make that argument,

11:46.460 --> 11:48.900
I'd probably say something like this.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.700
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.500
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty

11:54.500 --> 11:56.060
in rural Oklahoma.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.660
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

11:58.660 --> 12:00.620
the same year she made her singing debut

12:00.620 --> 12:02.380
at the Baptist Church.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.620
Parts of my childhood,

12:03.620 --> 12:05.700
I blocked out because it hurts too much.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.060
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.460
and my parents were remarried,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.380
and I was baptized and came to know Christ

12:11.380 --> 12:12.940
as my personal savior.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.100
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.620
It was real painful,

12:17.620 --> 12:19.460
and it just about killed my mother.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.500
She was a very submissive wife.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.260
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.540
She let my dad step all over her.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.940
Because of him, I think I went through life

12:28.940 --> 12:30.940
for a long time hating all men.

12:30.940 --> 12:34.340
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory

12:34.340 --> 12:36.700
as a feeling of intense ambition.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.220
A relentless drive to succeed

12:38.220 --> 12:40.180
at doing well the thing I loved.

12:40.180 --> 12:45.180
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

12:45.220 --> 12:49.580
♪ His truth is marching on ♪

12:49.580 --> 12:51.900
But Anita's ambition conflicted

12:51.940 --> 12:53.340
with her submissive role

12:53.340 --> 12:55.700
as a traditional Christian woman.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.540
In 1960, Anita married Bob Green,

12:58.540 --> 13:00.180
Miami's top disc jockey,

13:00.180 --> 13:03.300
with only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.300
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.140
Yeah.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.180
Green was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

13:12.180 --> 13:14.220
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

13:14.220 --> 13:16.500
Green manipulated Bryant with a cruelty

13:16.500 --> 13:19.220
nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.940
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

13:21.940 --> 13:25.100
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.020
But while submitting to her husband

13:27.020 --> 13:28.980
and raising four children,

13:28.980 --> 13:31.020
Anita was still able to build the career

13:31.020 --> 13:32.220
she'd always wanted.

13:32.220 --> 13:35.660
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice,

13:35.660 --> 13:37.820
earning half a million dollars a year,

13:37.820 --> 13:39.100
enough to move her family

13:39.100 --> 13:42.900
into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.340
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.860
Did she really deserve to lose it all?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.300
Just because she took a stand

13:51.300 --> 13:53.140
for something she believed in?

13:53.140 --> 13:54.900
Anita Bryant's role as a leader

13:54.900 --> 13:56.940
in the campaign against homosexuals

13:56.940 --> 13:59.500
may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.140
Are you being blackballed?

14:01.140 --> 14:03.660
Well, it looks that way.

14:03.660 --> 14:04.940
It's worse than that.

14:04.940 --> 14:05.820
We're being threatened,

14:05.820 --> 14:08.020
and there's all kinds of harassment,

14:08.020 --> 14:09.660
even with my job with Florida Citrus.

14:09.660 --> 14:13.260
I have been blacklisted for exercising the right of a mother

14:13.260 --> 14:16.340
to defend her children and all children

14:16.340 --> 14:19.100
against their being recruited by homosexuals.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.740
Her entire life had become a series of catastrophes.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.380
She'd been dropped as spokesperson by the orange growers.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.740
She had been dropped as a commentator

14:25.740 --> 14:27.460
on the Orange Bowl parade.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.460
She lost a television show contract.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.220
Her bookings dropped drastically.

14:31.220 --> 14:34.220
It destroys the dream that I have had since I was a child

14:34.220 --> 14:36.540
to entertain and present wholesome subjects

14:36.540 --> 14:38.420
to my fellow Americans

14:38.420 --> 14:42.220
because I dared to speak out for straight and normal America.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.940
No one has paid as dearly as Anita Bryant

14:44.940 --> 14:47.260
for taking a public stand on something she believed in.

14:47.260 --> 14:51.580
I remember lying in the bed in my mother's house

14:51.580 --> 14:53.740
in a fetal position and wanting to die.

14:53.740 --> 14:55.820
Gay activists in the 1970s

14:55.820 --> 14:57.700
didn't exactly limit their tactics

14:57.700 --> 15:00.860
to polite debate in the free marketplace of ideas.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.660
Stop Anita now!

15:02.660 --> 15:04.460
Stop Anita now!

15:04.460 --> 15:05.300
Stop Anita now!

15:05.300 --> 15:07.460
Homosexuals started fighting back.

15:07.460 --> 15:08.980
The gays formed new groups

15:08.980 --> 15:11.420
and picketed the performers' public appearances,

15:11.420 --> 15:13.100
forcing her to cancel a few.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.700
Gay activists routinely compared Anita to Adolf H.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.620
They created pastiches of her orange juice slogan.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.500
They blamed her for hate crimes.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.220
They burned her in effigy.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.740
They disrupted events she was involved in.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.380
They printed toilet paper with her face on it.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.260
Some sent Anita death threats.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.180
Or they mailed her rotting oranges,

15:32.180 --> 15:35.020
dead cockroaches, human excrement.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.620
See, this is how you canceled people before phones.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.980
Instead of shitposting,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.660
you would simply mail actual human shit

15:41.660 --> 15:43.420
through the United States Postal Service.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.980
Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.300
Anita's husband pleaded to supporters.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.580
How would you men feel if you opened a letter

15:51.580 --> 15:53.380
and there was a photo of your wife's head

15:53.380 --> 15:55.980
superimposed on some other female nude body

15:55.980 --> 15:59.500
in the most lewd and shocking sexual act you can imagine?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.540
I can imagine quite a lot.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.060
I do think it would be fair to say

16:02.060 --> 16:05.660
that a lot of the rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.060
Lillian Faderman recounts that lesbians,

16:08.060 --> 16:10.100
particularly lesbian feminists,

16:10.100 --> 16:12.700
abhorred the sexist terms that were being used

16:12.700 --> 16:14.420
to characterize Anita Bryant.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.620
Bitch and whore, gay men called her.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.640
The harassment escalated to the point

16:18.640 --> 16:20.900
where Anita had to cancel her book tour

16:20.900 --> 16:24.660
due to demonstrations and bomb threats from gay activists.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.780
And of course, there was the pie.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.420
Oh!

16:28.420 --> 16:30.980
So much for the tolerant Mattachine society.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.820
It's kind of a deep cut.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.820
Well, something to entertain the boomer queers.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.940
Gay activists claimed to stand for human rights,

16:36.940 --> 16:39.300
but what about Anita's right to free speech?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.660
I wish I had some literal pearls to clutch.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.140
Civil libertarian Nat Hentoff wrote in his 1992 book

16:45.140 --> 16:47.380
Free Speech for Me but Not for Thee

16:47.380 --> 16:49.820
that the orange shoes boycott reminded him

16:49.820 --> 16:52.820
of a little thing called McCarthyism.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.440
Have you ever considered that being pro-gay

16:55.440 --> 16:57.940
is quite similar to being anti-gay

16:57.940 --> 17:00.060
in that both are opinions?

17:00.060 --> 17:03.400
As Anita tells it, she and her foot soldiers of God

17:03.400 --> 17:06.960
were the victims of sinister gay carpetbaggers.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.360
The foot soldiers were housewives and mothers,

17:09.360 --> 17:11.400
religious and civic leaders in opposition

17:11.400 --> 17:13.800
to a well-organized, highly financed,

17:13.800 --> 17:17.160
and politically militant group of homosexual activists.

17:17.160 --> 17:21.000
We were cast as bigots, haters, discriminators,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.320
and deniers of basic human rights.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.440
And all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned

17:26.440 --> 17:28.200
for our children and our community.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.960
So Anita's version of the story is that she

17:30.960 --> 17:34.440
and a handful of well-intentioned Christian mothers

17:34.440 --> 17:38.160
were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia

17:38.160 --> 17:40.760
of gay extremists all because they had

17:40.760 --> 17:45.240
a few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual

17:45.240 --> 17:46.880
cavorting with little boys.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.320
Cavorting with little boys.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.320
Is it really fair to call this woman a bigot?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.120
Until the Dade County Ordinance,

17:53.120 --> 17:55.080
Anita was a registered Democrat

17:55.080 --> 17:57.200
and considered herself a liberal.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.440
And she never said that she hated gay people

17:59.440 --> 18:00.840
or wanted them dead.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.800
In fact, she even said that she loves homosexuals.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.960
I love homosexuals, if you can believe that.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.120
I love them enough to tell them the truth

18:10.120 --> 18:12.680
because I know that there is hope for the homosexuals

18:12.680 --> 18:16.680
that if they're willing to turn from sin

18:16.680 --> 18:18.360
the same as any individual,

18:18.360 --> 18:20.760
that they can be ex-homosexuals

18:20.760 --> 18:22.320
the same as there can be an ex-murderer,

18:22.320 --> 18:23.880
an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.280
She loves homosexuals because they can change.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.120
Just like murderers.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.280
Would a bigot have said that?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.880
Just about McFuckin' had it.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.680
Anita was so kind-hearted,

18:36.680 --> 18:40.200
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.000
I can relate to the homosexual

18:42.000 --> 18:44.880
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.880
I really felt the rejection of my father

18:46.880 --> 18:48.040
and that is one of the things

18:48.040 --> 18:51.080
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.180
Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,

18:54.180 --> 18:56.100
no matter what they think of my motives.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.480
I've always said I love the sinner

18:57.480 --> 18:58.600
but I hate the sin.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.240
Wow, what an empath.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.120
You know, I actually think it's really noble

19:03.120 --> 19:06.340
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

19:06.340 --> 19:07.760
onto the marginalized group

19:07.760 --> 19:10.520
whose rights she's trying to take away.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.880
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing

19:12.880 --> 19:14.760
to both sides, to many sides.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.880
We've considered all the evidence.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.160
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

19:20.160 --> 19:23.840
and ask, did Anita Bryant really deserve

19:23.840 --> 19:25.320
that pie to the face?

19:25.320 --> 19:28.160
Well, yes, obviously.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.760
Look, the point I'm trying to make here

19:29.760 --> 19:32.600
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

19:32.600 --> 19:35.680
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality

19:35.680 --> 19:38.800
and to twist them into fucked up apologia

19:38.800 --> 19:40.920
for horrible oppressive behavior.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.640
If you play this game long enough,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.380
you can essentially explain away

19:44.380 --> 19:46.400
the entire concept of bigotry

19:46.400 --> 19:49.760
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.240
There's only tragically misunderstood people

19:52.240 --> 19:55.440
with difficult childhoods and valid concerns

19:55.440 --> 19:58.800
cruelly demonized by militant activists

19:58.800 --> 20:00.880
defaming and silencing them

20:00.880 --> 20:04.960
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.800
Now, because you, viewers,

20:07.800 --> 20:10.280
are smart, media-literate people,

20:10.280 --> 20:13.400
you understand framing, so you already know

20:13.400 --> 20:16.900
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant to J.K. Rowling.

20:16.900 --> 20:20.800
In case you didn't know, J.K. Rowling, ugh.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.200
J.K. Rowling is a popular author

20:24.200 --> 20:27.720
who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

20:27.720 --> 20:30.880
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers

20:30.880 --> 20:32.720
masturbating into stolen panties

20:32.720 --> 20:35.040
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
Lo-ho-ho, dear readers.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.240
Christ, what a nightmare.

20:40.080 --> 20:44.360
Chapter three, the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.600
All right, kids, it's transcend time.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.600
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast

20:51.400 --> 20:54.280
about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps Roper,

20:54.280 --> 20:57.440
an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church,

20:57.440 --> 21:00.320
the notorious hate group from Topeka, Kansas,

21:00.320 --> 21:03.660
most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers

21:03.660 --> 21:06.920
with signs that say, God hates f**ks.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.880
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.760
J.K. Illy, the Westboro Baptist Church

21:12.760 --> 21:16.080
is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups

21:16.080 --> 21:17.000
in the world.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
In a way, I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.760
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.480
I went to a counter protest in 2010.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.440
I remember how when I was in high school,

21:28.440 --> 21:31.240
the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing

21:31.240 --> 21:33.920
that conservatives and liberals could agree on

21:33.920 --> 21:37.280
because they hated the troops and the gays,

21:37.280 --> 21:40.600
essentially the two genders of 2006.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.440
But let's not pretend

21:41.440 --> 21:43.800
that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.760
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro,

21:45.760 --> 21:49.080
she used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies

21:49.080 --> 21:51.040
about how the gays are going to hell,

21:51.040 --> 21:54.440
which to this day, I am a big fan of.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.040

21:58.040 --> 22:01.560

22:20.160 --> 22:23.680
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012

22:23.680 --> 22:26.480
after a crisis of faith precipitated

22:26.480 --> 22:29.080
by a power struggle within the church.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.000
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.400
which is honestly a pretty interesting account

22:34.400 --> 22:37.160
of deconversion and the circumstances

22:37.160 --> 22:39.640
that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.080
Megan contacted me for her podcast

22:42.120 --> 22:44.640
because I had criticized JK Rowling

22:44.640 --> 22:46.680
in a video a couple years ago.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.720
Now you may be wondering,

22:47.720 --> 22:50.360
why would I think that a person who's been carrying

22:50.360 --> 22:52.880
a God hates sign most of her life

22:52.880 --> 22:54.400
would be the correct person

22:54.400 --> 22:56.520
to lead an international conversation

22:56.520 --> 22:59.440
about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.240
Because I'm an idiot.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.080
Happy?

23:02.080 --> 23:04.520
Basically, I agreed to the podcast

23:04.520 --> 23:06.920
because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.040
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church

23:10.080 --> 23:13.320
wants to mediate a conversation between me

23:13.320 --> 23:15.360
and the author of Harry Potter.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.160
Would you say no to that?

23:17.160 --> 23:20.320
Maybe, if you're smart.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.880
Last month, the podcast was announced

23:22.880 --> 23:27.600
in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,

23:27.600 --> 23:31.280
obviously a tendentious framing that posits JoRoe

23:31.280 --> 23:34.520
as the target of an irrational trans witch hunt.

23:34.520 --> 23:37.480
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling

23:37.520 --> 23:41.000
complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.640
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob

23:43.640 --> 23:46.320
holding a rotten hell Rowling sign

23:46.320 --> 23:49.200
juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

23:49.200 --> 23:52.480
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.840
This did not bode well.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.440
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter

23:57.440 --> 24:00.280
because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy

24:00.280 --> 24:04.360
to some kind of unearned JK Rowling redemption tour.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.000
This caused Megan's mom Shirley to quote tweet me

24:08.000 --> 24:10.580
calling me a bigot against God.

24:10.580 --> 24:14.500
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.960
There's only one of him.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.200
And he could really use your help, Shirley.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.640
I said in these tweets that I felt used,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.960
which that is how I felt,

24:22.960 --> 24:26.440
but ultimately I need to take full responsibility

24:26.440 --> 24:28.000
for my involvement in this.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.640
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this

24:30.640 --> 24:32.600
is you honestly have no idea

24:32.600 --> 24:34.840
what the final product is gonna be like.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.760
So the decision to participate is always a leap of faith.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.180
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.480
There were red flags from the beginning,

24:44.480 --> 24:48.040
and I ignored them because I was projecting my own hopes

24:48.040 --> 24:49.440
onto the situation.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.760
You know, it's a compelling story.

24:51.760 --> 24:55.600
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot

24:55.600 --> 24:59.200
could talk some sense into a famous current bigot.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.640
We all love a good redemption arc,

25:01.640 --> 25:05.640
and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.640
That's something I've moved away from,

25:07.640 --> 25:08.920
but there's still part of me

25:08.920 --> 25:11.120
that wants to see the best in people

25:11.120 --> 25:13.800
and to believe that people can change

25:13.800 --> 25:17.960
if you just talk to them and make a good enough argument.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.600
Maybe my wishful thinking was

25:21.600 --> 25:24.680
that because Megan left Westbro,

25:24.680 --> 25:27.080
that must mean that she must understand

25:27.080 --> 25:31.600
the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

25:32.360 --> 25:34.560
And despite no evidence for this,

25:34.560 --> 25:38.440
my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally

25:38.440 --> 25:42.280
and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe

25:42.280 --> 25:46.000
about all the transphobic stuff she says, right?

25:46.920 --> 25:47.840
Wrong.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.680
I'm Megan Phelps-Roper,

25:49.680 --> 25:52.920
and these are The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

25:57.420 --> 25:59.480
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling

26:03.560 --> 26:06.840
The podcast presents Rowling as a complex,

26:06.840 --> 26:09.080
humane, heroic figure

26:09.080 --> 26:12.080
with an inspiring feminist backstory.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.040
Joe Rowling's rise to success

26:14.040 --> 26:16.400
is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.680

of transgender activists.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.360
All because she, as a woman,

26:27.360 --> 26:32.360
had a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.600
I had been becoming increasingly concerned

26:37.600 --> 26:40.440
about the way in which women were being shut down.

26:40.440 --> 26:44.160
Women who I felt had some very valid concerns.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.960
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing

26:46.960 --> 26:51.960
of the conflict as feminists versus trans rights activists

26:52.640 --> 26:54.440
whom Rowling describes as

26:54.480 --> 26:58.400
a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.160
For the first five hours of this podcast,

27:02.160 --> 27:06.360
Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational mob

27:06.360 --> 27:11.360
of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.400
You are murdering trans children!

27:14.400 --> 27:15.240
Yeah!

27:15.240 --> 27:16.640
Let's get up on time!

27:16.640 --> 27:17.680
A huge amount of,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.960
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.120
And you did it at my birthday dinner.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.400
There's this one clip

27:23.400 --> 27:28.080
of some kind of Antifa super soldier's abrasive screaming

27:28.080 --> 27:30.760
that they play, like, once per episode.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.280
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

27:33.280 --> 27:35.120
You look like you got your teeth knocked out,

27:35.120 --> 27:36.680
you fucking fascist!

27:36.680 --> 27:38.920
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares

27:38.920 --> 27:40.640
and you will die alone!

27:40.640 --> 27:44.400
And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks

27:44.400 --> 27:47.200
chanting some kind of medieval lament.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.080
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

27:50.200 --> 27:53.960
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

27:55.480 --> 27:58.480
Just in case you didn't get from the title

27:58.480 --> 28:00.560
that this is a witch hunt.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.400
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

28:06.880 --> 28:08.200
Do you guys get it?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.840
Do you get it yet?

28:09.840 --> 28:12.960
You got your teeth knocked out, you fucking fascist!

28:12.960 --> 28:14.320
Let's get up on time!

28:14.320 --> 28:16.720
And then these mobs of irrational,

28:16.720 --> 28:19.760
misogynistic, trans rights fanatics

28:20.440 --> 28:23.400
are contrasted with this poignant story

28:23.400 --> 28:27.000
of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband

28:27.000 --> 28:30.760
to publish our generation's most beloved novels.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.600
I was still very committed to those parts

28:33.600 --> 28:35.840
that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

28:35.840 --> 28:37.480
because there was a truth to them

28:38.360 --> 28:39.840
and there was a power to them.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.320
The only voices of genuine trans dissent

28:43.320 --> 28:46.520
appear in episode six out of seven,

28:46.520 --> 28:48.560
more than five hours in.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.240
And there's only two of us.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.400
One is me, shame,

28:53.400 --> 28:55.760
and the other is a teenager named Noah

28:55.760 --> 28:59.040
who kinda just seems like he wants to be liked

28:59.040 --> 29:02.720
and understood and wishes that his favorite author

29:02.720 --> 29:06.720
would please stop saying bigoted things about him.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.120
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,

29:08.120 --> 29:10.160
or I was such a big Harry Potter fan,

29:10.160 --> 29:14.320
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.880
I can't even state how important it was to me.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.680
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography

29:19.680 --> 29:21.800
from my third grade classroom

29:21.800 --> 29:23.640
and I kept it for a long time

29:23.640 --> 29:24.800
because I just loved reading it

29:24.800 --> 29:26.280
because I just admired her so much.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.400
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.120
On my last day editing this video,

29:31.120 --> 29:32.680
I got in touch with Noah.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.000
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast

29:35.000 --> 29:37.960
he wanted me to pass along, and this is what he said.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.160
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue

29:40.160 --> 29:42.760
are very different from any sort of rhetorical debate.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.240
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

29:45.240 --> 29:48.040
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

29:48.040 --> 29:50.400
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health,

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
well-being, and ability to survive.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.680
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling

29:54.680 --> 29:57.120
should come second to fighting for maintained access

29:57.120 --> 29:59.640
to healthcare, support, and general resources

29:59.640 --> 30:02.320
for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.240
I agree.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.200
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

30:05.200 --> 30:08.040
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.400
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling

30:11.400 --> 30:13.080
is the victim of a witch hunt

30:13.080 --> 30:15.800
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.960
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.320
I mean, Turf is basically witch.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.280
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.520
Show me the actual words, Jack.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.480
Show me where I said I'm the victim

30:30.480 --> 30:32.680
of a witch hunt by trans people.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.000
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.040
Yes, a podcast on which I never once say

30:39.040 --> 30:41.960
I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

30:41.960 --> 30:42.800
What are you talking about?

30:43.520 --> 30:44.360
I'm not scamming the government,

30:44.360 --> 30:45.200
if that's what you're saying.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.560
Your license plate says scamming.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.280
Uh, no.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.160
What do you mean, no?

30:51.160 --> 30:52.480
Yes.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.320
Joanne, show me where I ever said

30:55.320 --> 30:58.440
that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.760
Why would you even think that?

31:00.760 --> 31:03.200
You're crazy.

31:03.200 --> 31:06.880
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt

31:06.880 --> 31:09.960
for sale now at Wild Womine Workshop.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.920
And Meghan is not much better.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.600
Like, there's this whole section in episode two

31:14.600 --> 31:16.560
where Meghan interviews Christians

31:16.560 --> 31:19.560
who burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s,

31:19.560 --> 31:22.640
and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.960
So looking back, would you say that the Christian parents

31:25.960 --> 31:28.280
were maybe part of a moral panic?

31:28.280 --> 31:29.200
Yeah, absolutely.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.080
It's a scary world out there.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.560
Meghan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests

31:34.560 --> 31:36.240
against Joe Roe are equivalent

31:36.240 --> 31:38.600
to the Christian ones in the 90s,

31:38.600 --> 31:41.000
but she does heavily imply it.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.240
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets,

31:44.240 --> 31:48.320
which led many, including lifelong fans of her work,

31:48.320 --> 31:52.280
to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned,

31:52.280 --> 31:56.280
boycotted, and in some cases, burned.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.760
When confronted about the obvious implications

31:58.760 --> 32:01.880
of the podcast's title, Meghan said,

32:01.880 --> 32:03.520
The title is ambiguous.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.400
Toward the end of her conversations,

32:05.400 --> 32:07.920
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling

32:07.920 --> 32:11.120
about discernment, about how a person can ever know

32:11.120 --> 32:13.240
if they're standing up for what's right

32:13.240 --> 32:14.920
or joining a moral panic.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.640
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.880
Meghan, I was not surprised.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.120
I know I won't ever regret

32:23.120 --> 32:25.240
having stood up on this issue, ever.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.000
The podcast released new episodes weekly,

32:28.000 --> 32:29.880
and whenever Meghan was challenged

32:29.880 --> 32:33.520
about the blatant one-sidedness, Meghan would respond,

32:33.520 --> 32:35.920
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened

32:35.920 --> 32:37.720
to the whole podcast yet.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.200
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.040
Much more of other perspectives is coming.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.520
Make sure to tune in next week.

32:45.520 --> 32:49.160
More bombshell revelations to come.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.760
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now,

32:52.760 --> 32:55.740
and I truly do not think that anyone

32:55.740 --> 32:58.560
with basic media comprehension skills

32:58.560 --> 33:00.360
could come away from this thinking

33:00.360 --> 33:03.100
that the main intent was anything other

33:03.100 --> 33:06.480
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr

33:06.480 --> 33:11.480
of an unjust, what's the word, witch hunt.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.880
This is the obvious implication of the podcast

33:15.880 --> 33:18.680
from the first words to the very last.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.400
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.280
The final episode concludes with this.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.480
There are more important things in this world

33:27.480 --> 33:30.200
than being popular, and that doesn't mean

33:30.200 --> 33:32.160
it's more important to me to be right.

33:33.040 --> 33:36.000
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.400
Why would you end on that note?

33:38.400 --> 33:42.080
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

33:42.080 --> 33:45.140
if Meghan didn't fundamentally believe

33:45.140 --> 33:47.680
that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

33:47.680 --> 33:50.000
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.080
Like, there really is no other reasonable way

33:52.080 --> 33:56.080
to interpret this, so I wish that she would just be honest.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
If you believe that J.K. Rowling

33:58.080 --> 34:01.080
is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,

34:01.080 --> 34:02.820
then just say that.

34:02.820 --> 34:05.240
Make the argument you want to make.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.920
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

34:08.920 --> 34:13.080
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

34:13.080 --> 34:16.260
Don't rely on innuendo and framing

34:16.260 --> 34:21.260
and lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point

34:21.540 --> 34:24.880
while coyly denying you have any kind of agenda

34:24.880 --> 34:28.640
beyond I just believe in conversation.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.180
I don't know, I just find this a slippery

34:31.180 --> 34:33.120
and dishonest way to argue.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.500
But if you happen to be a fan

34:35.500 --> 34:37.700
of slippery and dishonest arguments,

34:37.700 --> 34:42.700
you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

34:44.700 --> 34:47.340
This video is sponsored by Canabox.

34:47.340 --> 34:49.540
Canabox offers fresh human meat

34:49.540 --> 34:51.780
delivered directly to your doorstep.

34:51.780 --> 34:55.080
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit

34:55.080 --> 34:57.540
the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

34:57.540 --> 35:00.340
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.060
Whenever a new box arrives,

35:02.080 --> 35:04.440
I get out my copy of Bless This Food,

35:04.440 --> 35:06.840
the Anita Bryant family cookbook.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.400
The best thing about human meat

35:08.400 --> 35:11.080
delivered to your home by mail in the dead of night?

35:11.080 --> 35:13.600
You don't know who you're eating,

35:13.600 --> 35:16.640
so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.560
Maybe.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.360
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.320
That means you're not allowed to cancel me.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.600
Chapter four, Joe Rose transphobia.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.440
That's it.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.720
I'm going full Slytherin.

35:31.740 --> 35:34.900
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

35:34.900 --> 35:38.540
Joe Rose compares trans activists to Death Eaters,

35:38.540 --> 35:41.380
the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

35:41.380 --> 35:45.660
My position is that this activist movement

35:45.660 --> 35:48.300
in the form that it's currently taking

35:48.300 --> 35:50.620
echoes the very thing that I was warning against

35:50.620 --> 35:51.620
in Harry Potter.

35:51.620 --> 35:54.100
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made

35:54.100 --> 35:56.740
to live in secret, and now is our time.

35:56.740 --> 36:01.300
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

36:01.320 --> 36:02.960
misogynistic movement.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.200
When an article then claimed she had equated

36:05.200 --> 36:06.980
trans people to Death Eaters,

36:06.980 --> 36:11.040
the podcast's PR firm reached out, demanding a correction,

36:11.040 --> 36:14.360
because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters,

36:14.360 --> 36:17.040
not trans people in general.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.960
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people,

36:18.960 --> 36:21.280
I just hate it when they advocate for themselves.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.800
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here,

36:23.800 --> 36:26.280
lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.160
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with,

36:29.180 --> 36:31.740
because she expresses it as an endless series

36:31.740 --> 36:34.780
of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

36:34.780 --> 36:37.920
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle

36:37.920 --> 36:42.300
consisting of a Mott, that is, a tower atop a mound or hill,

36:42.300 --> 36:45.740
easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard

36:45.740 --> 36:49.300
that's much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.780
So a Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes

36:51.780 --> 36:55.740
a provocative claim that's difficult to defend, the Bailey.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.500
And then, when confronted with counterarguments,

36:58.520 --> 37:01.080
they walk it back to a much less controversial

37:01.080 --> 37:04.600
and easy to defend version of the claim, the Mott.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.520
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim

37:08.520 --> 37:10.480
like sex is real.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.200
What does she mean by that?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.840
What are the implications?

37:13.840 --> 37:16.420
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks

37:16.420 --> 37:20.640
it's very sinister that in the Associated Press Style Guide,

37:20.640 --> 37:23.740
it says that instead of referring to a trans woman

37:23.740 --> 37:26.360
as a man who identifies as a woman,

37:26.380 --> 37:29.700
journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

37:29.700 --> 37:33.460
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.760
They've edged from identifies as a woman,

37:36.760 --> 37:38.820
so a man identifies as a woman,

37:38.820 --> 37:40.660
and I think we all understand what that means,

37:40.660 --> 37:44.460
into is a woman, and that's precisely the creep

37:44.460 --> 37:46.540
that I'm talking about.

37:46.540 --> 37:51.340
We are using language to make accurate definition

37:51.340 --> 37:54.380
of sex difference unspeakable.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.940
Which is, of course, false,

37:55.940 --> 37:59.740
because the words trans and cis exist precisely

37:59.740 --> 38:02.220
to make it easy to talk about sex difference.

38:02.220 --> 38:03.900
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.820
God, there's this whole section of the podcast

38:05.820 --> 38:08.300
that sort of implies that transgender people

38:08.300 --> 38:12.060
were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into

38:12.060 --> 38:13.340
because we don't have time.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.940
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks

38:14.940 --> 38:18.700
that all people who menstruate must be referred to as women.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.860
Or was it wombin?

38:19.860 --> 38:21.380
I'm pretty sure it was womp mud.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.860
So trans men and trans masculine people,

38:23.860 --> 38:27.500
they're all women and must be referred to as women,

38:27.500 --> 38:30.100
because J.K. Rowling demands it.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.680
This is controversial, right?

38:31.680 --> 38:34.740
Calling trans women men who identify as women,

38:34.740 --> 38:36.540
calling trans men women.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.620
This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.140
Trans women are men, trans men are women.

38:42.140 --> 38:45.700
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

38:45.700 --> 38:49.040
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash,

38:49.040 --> 38:51.600
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

38:51.600 --> 38:53.840
I'm being persecuted just for saying

38:53.840 --> 38:56.080
that women should be allowed to discuss

38:56.080 --> 38:58.800
how being female has shaped our lives.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.200
Women should be allowed to discuss

39:01.200 --> 39:03.520
how being female has shaped our lives.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.400
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial

39:06.400 --> 39:09.920
interpretation of sex is real, the Mott.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.160
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes

39:13.160 --> 39:15.920
make about trans people follows this pattern.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.840
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstater,

39:19.600 --> 39:20.840
will tweet inflammatory things like,

39:20.840 --> 39:23.100
men cannot change into women.

39:23.100 --> 39:24.760
But then when she's criticized,

39:24.760 --> 39:26.680
she'll say that she's being attacked

39:26.680 --> 39:28.760
for gender critical belief.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.400
Gender critical belief,

39:30.400 --> 39:34.040
which is the absolutely ordinary belief about sex,

39:34.040 --> 39:37.000
that your mother and your grandmother are women,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.920
that being female is a thing.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.560
Your mother and grandmother are women.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.560
Being female is a thing.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.840
That's literally all I'm saying.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.080
But if that's literally all she was saying,

39:48.120 --> 39:50.840
then no one would be mad, would they?

39:50.840 --> 39:51.680
Nine.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.600
Gnar.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.880
Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.520
Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.760
Your mom's a woman.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.160
Ah!

40:01.160 --> 40:03.880
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.760
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

40:06.760 --> 40:08.680
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.560
Then when trans people, understandably, get mad,

40:11.560 --> 40:13.720
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked

40:13.720 --> 40:17.120
just for saying that being female is part of my experience.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.160
It's dishonest.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.240
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,

40:20.240 --> 40:22.280
and then when trans people talk trash back,

40:22.280 --> 40:23.920
they pretend that they're being victimized

40:23.920 --> 40:26.080
for making totally innocuous statements.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.760
We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.840
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt every jacked 6'3 bro he met

40:33.840 --> 40:36.440
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,

40:36.440 --> 40:39.640
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on,

40:39.640 --> 40:43.040
I'm a little guy, I'm just a little guy, no.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.360
It's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.920
And somehow it always worked.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.040
So a birthday boy argument is when you make

40:50.040 --> 40:52.440
aggressive, inflammatory assertions,

40:52.440 --> 40:56.200
followed by teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,

40:56.200 --> 40:57.680
when the target reacts with anything

40:57.680 --> 40:59.440
less than extreme politeness.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.880
Another common tactic you'll see

41:00.880 --> 41:03.440
any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed

41:03.440 --> 41:05.240
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

41:05.240 --> 41:08.480
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.640
For example, here's someone on Twitter

41:10.640 --> 41:12.920
called large gamete producer.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.000
It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist

41:16.640 --> 41:19.880
that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate

41:19.880 --> 41:22.080
is horribly oppressive and degrading,

41:22.080 --> 41:23.960
but then they'll just straight up call themselves

41:23.960 --> 41:26.560
large gamete producer.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.480
Which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

41:29.480 --> 41:33.480
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.680
Oh, I like it, it's very broodmother.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.520
That Rowling's words regularly appear

41:37.520 --> 41:40.600
in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence

41:40.600 --> 41:42.840
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.160
She's like their queen, their leader,

41:45.440 --> 41:46.360
their headmistress.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.080
She's the best thing that ever happened to them,

41:48.080 --> 41:50.320
because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading

41:50.320 --> 41:51.160
a lot of people.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.200
If you know, you know.

41:52.200 --> 41:56.440
Large gamete producer says, JK isn't anti-trans.

41:56.440 --> 42:00.000
Give me just one direct quote that she has said

42:00.000 --> 42:01.400
which is anti-trans.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.700
Oh, what's that?

42:02.700 --> 42:04.240
You can't find one?

42:04.240 --> 42:06.440
Well, color me shocked.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.280
Imagine.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.640
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

42:09.640 --> 42:13.160
let's take a look at large gamete producer's profile.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.720
Trans women are not women, they are men.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.480
Trans men are not men, they are women.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.880
Nothing can change that.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.260
Sex is binary.

42:22.260 --> 42:25.360
Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,

42:25.360 --> 42:28.720
trans men are women is a transphobic statement,

42:28.720 --> 42:31.400
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

42:31.400 --> 42:33.640
This is why the first question you should always ask

42:33.640 --> 42:36.720
such people is, do you believe that transphobia

42:36.720 --> 42:38.460
is a legitimate concept?

42:38.460 --> 42:40.160
What are some examples of statements

42:40.160 --> 42:42.200
that you would consider transphobic?

42:42.200 --> 42:43.840
Because many of them don't believe

42:43.840 --> 42:46.080
that transphobia is a valid concept

42:46.080 --> 42:47.760
because they don't think that trans people

42:47.760 --> 42:49.400
are a legitimate minority.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.880
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.000
There is no such thing.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.900
There are people that call themselves these things

42:56.900 --> 43:00.160
that may have other issues manifesting

43:00.160 --> 43:02.280
that then make them think they're this, but no.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.960
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.700
There may be more words that we have to say

43:06.700 --> 43:07.640
in order to say that.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.960
We may call it transgender ideology,

43:09.960 --> 43:11.480
but when it comes to a person,

43:11.480 --> 43:13.980
they may be following transgender ideology,

43:13.980 --> 43:15.520
but they are not transgender.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.060
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

43:18.060 --> 43:20.240
being anything other than a man or a woman.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.600
So when they say, show me an example

43:22.600 --> 43:25.280
of something transphobic J.K. Rowling has said,

43:25.280 --> 43:26.560
this is a trap.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.800
They're just messing with you.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.840
There's nothing that she could have said

43:29.840 --> 43:31.880
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.160
Now, if you're someone who believes

43:33.160 --> 43:35.240
that transphobia is a valid concept

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

43:38.280 --> 43:40.240
but you just genuinely are unaware

43:40.240 --> 43:42.560
of what J.K. Rowling has said on the topic,

43:42.560 --> 43:44.720
then I will refer you to my past video

43:44.720 --> 43:46.680
on J.K. Rowling's transphobia

43:46.680 --> 43:48.560
rather than recapping it all here.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

43:51.240 --> 43:52.560
since I made that video.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,

43:57.520 --> 43:59.340
because she's not a complete idiot,

43:59.340 --> 44:02.140
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.400
She said, save our children.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.840
I love homosexuals.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.780
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

44:08.320 --> 44:10.020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

44:10.020 --> 44:12.260
but he will share a lot of statistics

44:12.260 --> 44:14.140
about anti-white crime.

44:14.140 --> 44:16.820
So this is not really a very good criterion

44:16.820 --> 44:19.580
for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

44:19.580 --> 44:22.460
What J.K. Rowling does do is tweet again and again

44:22.460 --> 44:24.300
about transgender rapists,

44:24.300 --> 44:27.180
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.320
She implies that trans-inclusive language

44:29.320 --> 44:32.660
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

44:32.660 --> 44:35.940
She writes at length about the vague, nefarious cabal

44:35.940 --> 44:38.100
of endocrinologists and ideologue

44:38.100 --> 44:41.260
that is supposedly persuading confused,

44:41.260 --> 44:43.480
vulnerable girls to transition.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.500
To quote Washington Post opinion writer Monica Hess,

44:46.500 --> 44:48.820
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

44:48.820 --> 44:52.200
but reading her Twitter feed, this is the overall effect.

44:52.200 --> 44:55.160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.020
It asks them to fear.

44:57.020 --> 45:01.300
It creates phobias of trans people.

45:01.300 --> 45:05.500
It creates trans phobias.

45:05.500 --> 45:06.380
If you will.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.700
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician

45:08.700 --> 45:12.940
Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights

45:12.940 --> 45:15.860
via a T-shirt she got from anti-trans hate monger

45:15.860 --> 45:17.100
Posey Parker.

45:17.100 --> 45:18.620
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

45:18.620 --> 45:20.780
There's no such thing as a trans person.

45:20.780 --> 45:21.740
There is no such thing.

45:21.740 --> 45:24.380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

45:24.380 --> 45:26.100
about Rowling's transphobia,

45:26.100 --> 45:28.140
it's that this is not a case

45:28.140 --> 45:30.700
of someone posting a couple insensitive tweets

45:30.700 --> 45:32.380
that got blown out of proportion.

45:32.380 --> 45:35.220
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent

45:35.220 --> 45:36.300
of trans rights.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.580
And because she's so famous,

45:41.580 --> 45:44.420
she's become the de facto global champion

45:44.420 --> 45:46.340
of backlash to trans rights.

45:46.340 --> 45:48.980
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.820
Except worse, because she's way more famous

45:51.820 --> 45:54.980
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

45:54.980 --> 45:57.180
Rowling has also praised self-described

45:57.180 --> 45:59.020
theocratic fascist Matt Walsh

45:59.020 --> 46:01.180
for his transphobic propaganda film.

46:01.180 --> 46:05.140
She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,

46:05.860 --> 46:07.060
known as Tims among people

46:07.060 --> 46:09.060
for whom this has become an unhealthy obsession.

46:09.060 --> 46:11.260
She retweets images of the trans colors

46:11.260 --> 46:13.240
being erased from the progress flag.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.700
Also the colors representing queer people of color.

46:15.700 --> 46:17.060
So, you know, great.

46:17.060 --> 46:17.900
Love that.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.580
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

46:20.580 --> 46:22.600
for the principled and valiant purpose

46:22.600 --> 46:24.100
of defending lesbians.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.360
It's something of a fixation for her.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.460
I find this particularly gross

46:28.460 --> 46:30.940
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

46:30.940 --> 46:33.620
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

46:33.620 --> 46:36.740
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

46:36.740 --> 46:37.740
of cis people.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.420
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

46:40.420 --> 46:43.260
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person

46:43.260 --> 46:46.680
and also most likely, at 96%,

46:46.680 --> 46:48.060
to say that they're supportive

46:48.060 --> 46:50.260
or very supportive of trans people.

46:50.260 --> 46:52.020
So I think it's fair to say

46:52.020 --> 46:55.980
that most gay women are probably not super thrilled

46:55.980 --> 46:59.660
whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.

46:59.660 --> 47:01.740
My own partner is a cis lesbian

47:01.780 --> 47:04.140
and I asked her if she enjoys J.K. Rowling

47:04.140 --> 47:07.460
defending her from the transsexuals and she said,

47:07.460 --> 47:10.300
"'It makes me wanna gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.'"

47:10.300 --> 47:13.900
By the way, here is J.K. Rowling enjoying a bit of banter

47:13.900 --> 47:16.700
with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

47:16.700 --> 47:19.340
the co-founder of Rowling's charity Lumos.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.380
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

47:21.380 --> 47:22.660
of the House of Lords

47:22.660 --> 47:25.980
who voted against same-sex marriage in 2013.

47:25.980 --> 47:28.860
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

47:28.860 --> 47:32.060
claiming that gay marriage would lead to degrading

47:32.060 --> 47:34.180
the status of women and girls.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.180
Truly one of the great lesbian allies.

47:37.180 --> 47:39.940
And in 2022, here is J.K. Rowling

47:39.940 --> 47:42.060
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.780
"'Excellent question, Emma.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.180
"'Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

47:47.180 --> 47:50.220
"'excludes and oppresses the most marginalized

47:50.220 --> 47:53.840
"'of all groups, i.e. people with penises and beards

47:53.840 --> 47:55.420
"'who want to shag women.

47:55.420 --> 47:58.680
"'And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

47:58.680 --> 48:01.760
"'They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.'"

48:01.760 --> 48:05.240
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have

48:05.240 --> 48:07.040
for the Gryffindor common room,

48:07.040 --> 48:09.680
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.920
Two straight women,

48:10.920 --> 48:14.080
one of whom is a homophobic peer of the realm,

48:14.080 --> 48:16.080
having a nice little chuckle together

48:16.080 --> 48:19.160
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.720
So that's it, right?

48:20.720 --> 48:21.640
It's over.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.840
Case closed.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.840
I still like hammering things.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.560
I'm not gonna argue anymore

48:31.560 --> 48:34.400
about whether J.K. Rowling is transphobic,

48:34.400 --> 48:36.880
because anyone who believes in transphobia

48:36.880 --> 48:39.600
can see that obviously she is.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.080
The question now is whether transphobia

48:42.080 --> 48:45.360
is the sort of thing that progressives can denounce,

48:45.360 --> 48:48.400
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

48:48.400 --> 48:50.320
misogyny, and homophobia.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.920
That's usually what we're talking about

48:51.920 --> 48:54.120
when we talk about J.K. Rowling, right?

48:54.160 --> 48:56.960
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

48:56.960 --> 49:00.480
That's what the witch trials of J.K. Rowling is about.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.920
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.680
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

49:06.680 --> 49:09.600
worthy of polite consideration and respect

49:09.600 --> 49:11.760
in liberal humane society?

49:11.760 --> 49:13.960
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

49:13.960 --> 49:16.040
that we can justifiably react to

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
with scorn and condemnation?

49:18.040 --> 49:20.120
And there's an even broader question here

49:20.120 --> 49:23.640
about whether we can justifiably react to anything

49:23.680 --> 49:25.520
with scorn and condemnation.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.920
Is canceling ever warranted?

49:27.920 --> 49:32.240
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

49:32.240 --> 49:35.840
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

49:35.840 --> 49:39.320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas,

49:39.320 --> 49:40.760
where we can all sit around

49:40.760 --> 49:43.160
debating the legitimacy of gay marriage

49:43.160 --> 49:46.200
or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

49:46.200 --> 49:48.200
Is the final solution a myth

49:48.200 --> 49:50.840
promulgated by the international Jew?

49:50.840 --> 49:54.400
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

49:54.400 --> 49:57.240
Wouldn't the taxpayer save a lot of money

49:57.240 --> 49:59.720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

49:59.720 --> 50:00.760
Who knows?

50:00.760 --> 50:02.320
These are open questions.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.080
Let's sit down with people on both sides,

50:05.080 --> 50:09.160
on many sides, and have calm, civil conversations about it

50:09.160 --> 50:11.600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.280
Chapter five, debate.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
Sar, I know I did this look before

50:18.160 --> 50:21.440
and it's not related to the video topic at all,

50:21.440 --> 50:23.280
but it just makes me feel sliving.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.600
The boy who slived.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.280
So Megan Phelps-Roper's viewpoint

50:27.280 --> 50:29.480
seems to be that scorn and condemnation

50:29.480 --> 50:31.120
are never appropriate,

50:31.120 --> 50:33.000
that we should approach every conflict

50:33.000 --> 50:34.600
with empathy and compassion,

50:34.600 --> 50:36.520
even when dealing with the worst,

50:36.520 --> 50:39.480
most destructive people in the world.

50:39.480 --> 50:42.640
Hi, my name is Megan, and my heretical belief

50:42.640 --> 50:45.240
is that even the people who seem to be

50:45.240 --> 50:48.120
the worst, most destructive people in the world

50:48.120 --> 50:51.680
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

50:51.680 --> 50:53.640
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

50:53.640 --> 50:57.680
In her book, in her TED talk, in her public appearances,

50:57.680 --> 51:00.560
Megan expresses the idea that society

51:00.560 --> 51:05.040
has recently become polarized in some unprecedented way,

51:05.040 --> 51:07.560
that we've all become extremists,

51:07.560 --> 51:08.840
that in some sense,

51:08.840 --> 51:12.560
we've all become the Westboro Baptist Church.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.800
I can't help but see in our public discourse

51:14.800 --> 51:17.280
so many of the same destructive impulses

51:17.280 --> 51:18.840
that ruled my former church.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.280
She identifies things like certainty,

51:21.280 --> 51:23.320
vilification of compromise,

51:23.320 --> 51:25.040
us versus them thinking,

51:25.040 --> 51:26.720
suppression of empathy,

51:26.720 --> 51:29.440
and celebration of death and misfortune

51:29.440 --> 51:32.880
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.760
And this really bothers Megan,

51:34.760 --> 51:37.520
because she claims that a decade ago,

51:37.520 --> 51:39.240
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

51:39.240 --> 51:42.120
how f*** marriage is abominable to God,

51:42.120 --> 51:46.400
it was people who engaged her in a civil, rational way

51:46.440 --> 51:50.160
that eventually led her to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

51:50.160 --> 51:54.120
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.880
She's totally right that if you want

51:55.880 --> 51:57.440
to change people's minds,

51:57.440 --> 52:00.240
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

52:00.240 --> 52:02.880
is usually the best way to do that.

52:02.880 --> 52:04.800
But Megan reaches another conclusion

52:04.800 --> 52:06.240
that I don't agree with,

52:06.240 --> 52:09.660
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

52:09.660 --> 52:11.960
are most likely to persuade people,

52:11.960 --> 52:14.680
we should never cancel anyone,

52:14.680 --> 52:16.720
even the most horrible bigots.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.400
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point,

52:20.400 --> 52:21.520
but what Megan means is

52:21.520 --> 52:23.800
we shouldn't say mean things to bigots.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.480
We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest

52:26.480 --> 52:28.160
or raise our voices.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.960
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,

52:30.960 --> 52:34.080
because that's just not how you change minds.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.040
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

52:36.040 --> 52:38.880
Deradicalization was a really important part

52:38.880 --> 52:40.520
of her life experience.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.220
She's also clearly holding out hope

52:42.220 --> 52:44.520
that other members of her family will leave Westboro

52:45.360 --> 52:46.280
and have a life on the outside.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.560
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.880
The last lines of her book address her family.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.760
I want to tell them that I love them.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.760
I'll just have to find another way.

52:54.760 --> 52:56.680
This is touching and human

52:56.680 --> 52:59.760
and also kind of a conflict of interest.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.320
The problem is Megan's views about this

53:02.320 --> 53:05.120
only make sense if you assume that Megan

53:05.120 --> 53:07.360
is the main character of reality.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.600
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

53:10.600 --> 53:13.880
is more important than protecting the people they target.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.440
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

53:16.440 --> 53:19.920
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

53:19.920 --> 53:23.320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

53:23.320 --> 53:25.600
and she's still homophobic.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.720
But even without Anita's blessing,

53:27.720 --> 53:31.120
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

53:31.120 --> 53:34.080
since the 1970s, because gay activists

53:34.080 --> 53:36.720
didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

53:36.720 --> 53:40.320
They needed to defeat her, and that's what they did.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.680
We have to accept that realistically,

53:42.680 --> 53:46.240
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

53:46.240 --> 53:49.560
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

53:49.560 --> 53:51.680
but there will always be bigots.

53:51.680 --> 53:55.160
And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

53:55.160 --> 53:57.960
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

53:57.960 --> 54:00.800
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

54:00.800 --> 54:05.040
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

54:05.040 --> 54:05.880
Nah.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.120
You would only think that if you're

54:07.120 --> 54:09.160
a total moral relativist.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.200
I guess controversial opinion,

54:11.200 --> 54:14.920
but bigotry is shameful, and it should be shamed.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.880
I'll say it.

54:15.880 --> 54:18.220
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas

54:18.220 --> 54:20.600
in your head, you might feel afraid

54:20.600 --> 54:22.800
to express them publicly for fear

54:22.800 --> 54:25.120
of being shamed or judged.

54:25.120 --> 54:28.360
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

54:28.360 --> 54:30.960
that punishes people for wrong-think?

54:30.960 --> 54:34.440
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful,

54:34.440 --> 54:36.000
and you should be ashamed of it,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.600
and the people judging you are right to do so.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.320
And sure, there are some very patient people

54:41.320 --> 54:44.360
who devote their lives to deradicalizing bigots,

54:44.360 --> 54:47.680
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.360
There's a guy named Darryl Davis

54:49.360 --> 54:51.840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

54:51.840 --> 54:54.800
for over 30 years, and he claims he's convinced

54:54.800 --> 54:57.200
more than 200 of them to leave.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.520
And good for him.

54:58.520 --> 55:01.320
Deradicalization is a valid strategy,

55:01.320 --> 55:03.800
but it cannot be the only strategy,

55:03.800 --> 55:06.960
and it must not be the primary strategy.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.120
Because we're not going to defeat racism

55:09.120 --> 55:12.840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.120
Feminists would be wasting their time

55:15.120 --> 55:18.160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.560
In general, I think that the massive effort

55:20.560 --> 55:23.360
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

55:23.360 --> 55:26.120
is better spent persuading other people

55:26.120 --> 55:27.560
not to listen to them.

55:27.560 --> 55:30.520
And it's also worth cautioning that deradicalization

55:30.520 --> 55:33.760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Saitanovic

55:37.760 --> 55:39.820
became the face of the fascist Unite the Right rally

55:39.820 --> 55:44.060
in 2017 when a photo of him mid-scream,

55:44.060 --> 55:46.740
tiki, torch in hand, was published

55:46.740 --> 55:48.980
in news outlets all over the country.

55:48.980 --> 55:51.300
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

55:51.300 --> 55:53.600
he gave immediately after the rally,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.940
but he began to question his beliefs

55:55.940 --> 55:58.620
after befriending a Muslim woman who,

55:58.620 --> 56:00.940
according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,

56:00.940 --> 56:03.720
challenged his views without insulting him,

56:03.720 --> 56:07.080
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.360
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

56:09.360 --> 56:11.380
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

56:11.380 --> 56:13.100
every trace of bigotry.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.400
In a 2019 interview with the London School

56:15.400 --> 56:18.240
of Economics student paper, Peter said,

56:18.240 --> 56:20.320
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.520
You're born either a man or a woman.

56:22.520 --> 56:26.400
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.240
When I did deradicalization work on YouTube,

56:29.240 --> 56:32.120
I used to get some criticism from people of color

56:32.120 --> 56:34.280
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

56:34.280 --> 56:37.800
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

56:37.800 --> 56:40.240
a frustration that I totally understand.

56:40.240 --> 56:43.120
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

56:43.120 --> 56:45.840
diverse leftist communities are maybe not

56:45.840 --> 56:48.440
the best holding space for someone who's

56:48.440 --> 56:50.560
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.760
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

56:52.760 --> 56:55.800
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

56:55.800 --> 56:58.600
but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant

56:58.760 --> 57:03.180
skepticism about anything she perceives as ideology.

57:03.180 --> 57:05.160
This is pretty common with people who used

57:05.160 --> 57:07.160
to be religious fundamentalists.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.240
They were so certain they were right,

57:09.240 --> 57:11.760
only to realize that everything they believed

57:11.760 --> 57:13.440
about the world is wrong.

57:13.440 --> 57:17.400
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

57:17.400 --> 57:20.520
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

57:20.520 --> 57:23.720
Coming from Westboro, where I believed so strongly

57:23.720 --> 57:25.660
that I was doing the right thing,

57:25.660 --> 57:27.440
and then to leave and come to believe

57:27.440 --> 57:29.660
that it was so destructive and harmful,

57:30.840 --> 57:35.840
I had this moment in time, and it lasted for many months,

57:36.280 --> 57:39.720
where I was like, how can I ever trust my own mind again?

57:39.720 --> 57:43.080
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

57:43.080 --> 57:47.240
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

57:47.240 --> 57:50.240
can cause problems, especially where topics

57:50.240 --> 57:52.280
of social justice are concerned.

57:52.280 --> 57:55.600
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

57:55.600 --> 58:00.000
that asks, why are marginalized people so unwilling

58:00.000 --> 58:02.800
to have calm, philosophical debates

58:02.800 --> 58:04.720
about whether they should have rights?

58:04.720 --> 58:07.960
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

58:07.960 --> 58:10.120
Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,

58:10.120 --> 58:12.720
in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

58:12.720 --> 58:15.080
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

58:15.080 --> 58:18.600
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

58:18.600 --> 58:20.760
until we can figure out what's going on.

58:20.760 --> 58:24.440
Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

58:24.440 --> 58:28.600
complained that trans activism and activism in general

58:28.600 --> 58:32.840
is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.

58:32.840 --> 58:37.720
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability

58:37.720 --> 58:42.720
and even frank mental illness in the activist community.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.920
I mean, really, in all activist communities,

58:45.920 --> 58:50.920
the level of viciousness and hysteria is,

58:51.160 --> 58:53.360
you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.120
Diversity, when?

58:55.120 --> 58:58.200
Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

59:02.080 --> 59:05.840
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.440
Aren't there certain situations

59:07.440 --> 59:09.600
where strong emotions are warranted?

59:09.600 --> 59:11.440
It reminds me of this awful episode

59:11.440 --> 59:13.960
of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,

59:13.960 --> 59:16.880
where Lil Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

59:16.880 --> 59:19.320
with his usual whining sophistry,

59:19.320 --> 59:21.580
and Joe gently raises objections

59:21.620 --> 59:23.700
for Ben to talk circles around.

59:23.700 --> 59:27.140
The human sex drive was made to procreate

59:27.140 --> 59:30.420
within a stable relationship in order to progenerate

59:30.420 --> 59:32.220
and have future generations of people.

59:32.220 --> 59:34.140
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

59:34.140 --> 59:36.660
whether you're talking about from masturbation

59:36.660 --> 59:39.820
to homosexual activity, is therefore a diminishment

59:39.820 --> 59:40.940
of the use of that drive.

59:40.940 --> 59:44.060
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

59:44.060 --> 59:47.580
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

59:47.580 --> 59:49.300
Imagine talking about different beliefs

59:49.300 --> 59:51.340
while still having a productive conversation.

59:52.100 --> 59:53.540
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

59:53.540 --> 59:55.060
The discussion here was excellent.

59:55.060 --> 59:56.780
Two guys with opposing opinions,

59:56.780 --> 59:59.420
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.700
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.300
This is how it should be done.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.460
Kudos to both of them.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.700
Joe is a great interviewer.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.160
He can totally disagree with someone

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.540
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.780
This is how it should be.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.260
Just two people sharing ideas,

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.180
learning different point of views from each other.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.260
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.620
Joe Rogan beautifully asks the tough questions,

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.180
and Ben answers honestly.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:22.860
He is strong in his faith.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.460
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.220
and they have a civil conversation.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.060
Great learning.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.820
And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.100
to have a dispassionate, theoretical conversation

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.580
about the ethics of homosexuality,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.940
because it's not their lives and their relationships

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.460
that are up for debate.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.260
These people don't understand the emotional burden

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.100
placed on marginalized people

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.580
who are asked to defend their rights.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.140
If you're straight, do you want to publicly debate

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.340
whether your marriage is valid?

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.660
Andrew Dworkin claimed that penetrative

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.380
heterosexual intercourse is inherently an act of violence.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.620
I've noticed that most straight men

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.300
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.900
so imagine how they'd react

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.380
if there was a powerful political movement

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.300
to criminalize penetration or revoke their right to marry.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.940
Add in a lifetime of ostracism, family rejection,

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.060
bullying, and discrimination,

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.940
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.780
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.780
It is my right to raise my child

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.780
with the moral precept that I find

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.700
to be beneficial for my child.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.860
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.980
And if he tries, I will meet him at the door with a gun.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.900
That is insane.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.860
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.260
because he can't handle the debate.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:45.340
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.580
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.300
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.140
I now have two choices.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.300
One is to leave the country utterly.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.260
Two is to pick up a gun.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.960
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.340
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative whose career requires

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.340
that he convince his right-wing audience

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.940
that he's one of the good ones.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.060
This means that he's willing to sit across

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.900
from his so-called friend, homophobe Ben Shapiro,

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.500
and listen to Ben say

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.180
he would never attend his anniversary party

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.340
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.980
There's a difference between me just being friends

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:26.220
with Dave and me actively participating in an event

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.140
that I feel is religiously sinful.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.740
The two of them then congratulate themselves

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.620
about how they can still be great friends.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.180
Why is it that we're able to do this

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.540
and most people can't do this?

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.380
That's what I'm curious about.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.700
Because we go home at night and we can have our own lives.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.180
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.020
with conservative Glenn Beck,

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.860
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.900
and then congratulates himself on having the conversation.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.460
I am a deeply religious man and my religion says

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:01.460
man and a woman, that is the basic building block of family.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.000
And that's what I believe.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But I also am, I also know God created you

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.400
just like he created me, flaws and all.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.800
I believe I have a gene, they've never found it,

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.400
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.680
because it runs in my family.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.800
So does craziness, but it runs in my family.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.920
Well, Dave smiles and nods,

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.720
probably because he's thinking about

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.200
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.960
Usually I just take out a picture of me and DeSantis

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.280
and then we're good because they get it, they get it,

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.040
that's my governor, yeah.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.920
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.240
and they see, finally, a reasonable gay person

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.160
who doesn't scream bigot at everyone who disagrees

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.040
and can actually have a civil conversation.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.600
But that's not what I see.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.880
I look at Dave Rubin and I see

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.160
a sublimely bootlicking doormat

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.880
who won't even defend his own family

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.680
from the most fundamental disrespect.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.520
I also can't help but notice

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.280
that none of these civil conversations

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.640
seem to change anyone's mind.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.000
Persuasion is more complicated

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.520
and less rational than people think.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.240
Meghan often says that she was deradicalized on Twitter,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.360
but if you read her book carefully,

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.160
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.880
The major precipitating event for Meghan's crisis of faith

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.840
was her mother's mistreatment

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.520
at the hands of an increasingly

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.880
misogynistic church leadership

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.520
that made Meghan feel like she was the victim

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.840
of the church for once.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.960
She says of the church discipline,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.000
for the first time in my life,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.840
the accused were people I lived with

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.440
and knew most intimately,

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.800
and I knew that the judgments leveled by the elders

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.720
were wrong.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.320
I could no longer blindly trust the judgment of these men.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.040
So she finally experienced firsthand

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.640
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.360
She stopped voting for the leopards

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.240
eating people's faces party

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.640
only when the leopards ate her face.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.920
It also seems relevant to notice

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.840
that the people who had calm, civil conversations

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.440
with Meghan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.640
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.560
They were mostly straight men,

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.840
like director Kevin Smith,

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.240
who started hashtag save Meghan

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.680
because, quote, she's hot.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.120
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.180
and that certainly seems to be the case with Meghan,

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.960
because one of the people who helped deradicalize her

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.720
is now her husband.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.920
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.160
if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.660
in deradicalization experiences.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.600
I think this experience is usually more akin

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.560
to religious conversion than it is to logical reasoning.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.080
There's also a world of difference

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.720
between the mostly private conversations

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.840
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.640
and the spectacle of public debate.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.080
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.720
because he livestreamed a civil conversation

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.000
with Dave Rubin.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.600
So who is this conversation even for?

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.240
Well, obviously it's for the audience.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.080
I think these civil conversations

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.340
basically function to reassure a homophobic audience

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.460
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:35.020
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.420
Look at Ben Shapiro.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.220
He is friends with a gay.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.220
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.780
of the Overton window,

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.460
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.820
So often people who want to promote bigotry

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.060
will use debate as a foot in the door.

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.900
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.860
are within the realm of reasonable

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.980
and socially accepted opinion.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.740
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.460
in a fury that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.000
without the British public having a proper debate

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.380
about these issues.

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.700
Now why do we need to have a proper debate

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.500
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.900
when drag performance has been a staple

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.420
of British entertainment

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.900
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.000
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.540
Three little maids from school.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.220
Fishy fishy fishy fish.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.380
As I am man,

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.660
my state is desperate for my master's love.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.940
As I am woman, now alas the day.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.120
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.660
on their own terms

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.820
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.860
It's how they convince the public

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.380
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.820
is actually a valid concern

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.900
rather than the tedious, small-minded whining about nothing

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.140
that it really is.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.940
Having the debate on a bigot's terms

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.540
is not a good way to win people over

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.300
unless you're really skilled

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.460
in the art of humiliating people,

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.820
which most of the time

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.680
is what public debate is actually about.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.340
This is something that J.K. Rowling

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.220
doesn't seem to understand.

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:26.380
In The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.560
Jo Ro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.580
She brings up right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:38.180
saying that activists are making a strategic error

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.060
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060
making him look dangerous and sexy.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.020
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.940
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.420
So is deplatforming a strategic error

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.660
that gives power to your opponent,

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.260
or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.700
I find Rowling's conviction

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.980
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.240
really out of touch.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.980
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.140
for the things he does.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.500
He has strategies for humiliating people.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.420
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.500
being fabulous and doing my hair,

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.860
to prepare a speech for you.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.260
Well, a few remarks, really.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.180
Feminism is cancer.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.540
Thank you very much.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.580
To again quote Ian Danskin,

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:26.740
you can't really reason with someone

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.140
who thinks that feminism is cancer

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.300
because you don't reason with cancer.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.860
You eradicate it.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.740
Rowling objects to the slogan no debate

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.740
in the strongest possible terms.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.820
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.860
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.620
We hear it all the time.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.420
That alarms me, really alarms me.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.780
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.660
than no debate.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.800
It's kind of amazing to me

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.780
that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.940
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.100
I truly hope that one day I am privileged enough

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.460
to be capable of such a perspective.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.860
Before I move on, I do want to clarify

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.740
that I do think there are trans issues

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.540
that are legitimately debatable

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.340
by people who are not bigots.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.980
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.440
is one of those issues.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.860
But it's a complicated issue.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:26.760
Like first of all, which sport are we talking about?

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.940
Are we talking about figure skating?

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.940
Middle school field hockey?

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.920
I see no reason why trans girls

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.620
should be excluded from that.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.180
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.380
well then it seems plausible

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.060
that trans women who have been through male puberty

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.460
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:49.180
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.220
People are transitioning younger now

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.580
and that's another thing you have to consider.

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.460
So I'm not against debating this issue,

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.540
I just want people to approach it

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.500
with nuance and good faith.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.700
And currently, a lot of the people

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:06.740
who are vocally against trans women and women's sports

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.140
sound like this.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:12.740
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.540
How ridiculous.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.660
That will take place on day one.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.540
And I don't wanna debate those people.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.260
I wanna serve them a banana cream pie.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.700
Chapter six, illiberal methods.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.600
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.260
about the trans rights movement

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.580
is she sees it as illiberal in its methods.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.780
So when I first became interested

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.060
and then deeply troubled

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:44.260
by what I saw as a cultural movement

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.660
that was illiberal in its methods.

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.180
So what are these illiberal methods?

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:53.860
If you are saying this person is canceled,

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.100
that is the language of a dictator.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:56.980
It's true.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.340
Cancel culture is exactly how the Third Reich started.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.420
First they canceled the socialists

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.220
and I did not speak out because the hashtag was trending.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.660
But maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.780
You know, I can't help but wonder

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.500
what counts as acceptable activist methods

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.740
to an author for whom Hermione protesting slavery

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.620
was taking things too far.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.740
I'm not fighting what I see as a powerful,

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.380
insidious, misogynistic movement.

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.540
I do not see this particular movement

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.580
as either benign or powerless.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.080
Rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.260
is dangerous and authoritarian in some unprecedented way

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.440
that makes it different from all past liberation movements.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.500
But how?

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500
What are these illiberal methods

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.480
that distinguish trans rights activism

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.300
from similar past movements?

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.400
Canceling?

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.460
Anita Bryant was way more canceled

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.440
than J.K. Rowling ever will be.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.440
Boycotts?

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.080
Boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.240
in modern history.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.360
Disrupting feminist meetings?

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.200
Disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist tradition.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.220
Haven't you heard of the Lavender Menace?

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.120
In 1969, Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.540
and founder of the National Organization for Women

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.640
and Second Wave Feminism in general,

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.900
coined the phrase Lavender Menace

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.660
to describe the threat she believed

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.260
that lesbians posed to the women's movement.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.580
would make it easy to dismiss the movement

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.580
as a bunch of mannish man-haters.

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.500
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.220
who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.900
to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.700
a disruptive public protest

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.540
designed to draw attention to gay rights issues.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.620
Think glitter bombing.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.740
Think pies.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.540
Half aggression, half whimsy.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.260
Like that time the lesbian Avengers

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.100
zapped Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.500
demanding that she resign.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.540
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.060
Centrism has gone too far and I am now pro-cancel culture.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.980
So just as the meeting was beginning,

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.420
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.420
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.220
and charged down the aisles laughing and screaming.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.060
Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.020
this conference won't proceed

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.740
until we talk about lesbians in the women's movement.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.900
One of the NOW organizers yelled back,

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.860
I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.540
You're acting like men.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.300
Betty Friedan would later speculate

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.660
that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.140
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.060
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.880
using illiberal tactics,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.020
not because they were against feminism,

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.020
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.060
to include them.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.660
It's the same thing that's happening today

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.240
when trans people disrupt feminist meetings,

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.980
as J.K. Rowling puts it,

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.760
interestingly neglecting to mention

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.740
which feminist meetings these are.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.060
I was starting to see activists behaving

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.840
in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.660
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:14.340
and kicking on windows, very threatening.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.520
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.500
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.280
than similar past movements.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.420
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.780
called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh who says,

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.020
all those gay rights and AIDS protests,

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.340
I don't remember a single one

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.300
where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.620
Not a single one.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.780
Not a single one.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:40.460
Not a single one.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.460
Not a single one.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:49.140
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.500
to the trans movement.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.140
And also, quote,

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.580
I will fucking nail you to a wall

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.660
what you have done to these innocent children.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.780
Your mutilation of these little humand

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.780
because they were gay will be nothing

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:08.340
compared to what I will do to you legally.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.060
You think you are ghouls.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.840
Wait till I deal with you, bastard, and I mean to.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.860
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.900
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.200
to a wall count as illiberal methods?

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.260
I guess J.K. Rowling doesn't think so

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.800
because she's never condemned it.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.420
In fact, when Dennis' Twitter suspension ended,

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.600
she was right there to welcome him back,

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.380
and she continues to retweet him.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.100
I've always been happy to acknowledge

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.100
that angry trans people on Twitter

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.060
sometimes take things too far.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.320
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.020
I don't support that, and I've called it out in the past.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.100
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.380
drama alert, who is not trans, tweeted at J.K. Rowling,

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.860
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.660
I called him out, tweeting,

01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.140
doing edgy ironic misogyny while defending trans people

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.740
magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.600
about there being misogyny in trans activism.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.660
I tweeted that because I recognize

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.820
that if people who are claiming to speak for you

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.140
are doing so in a misogynistic way,

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.860
and if you let that slide,

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.060
you're going to wake up one day

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.500
to find that you're in a misogynistic movement.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.940
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.700
explaining that actually,

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.100
I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.420
for the moral necessity of being misogynistic to J.K. Rowling

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.820
and then he accused me of cancel culturing him

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:31.820
while at the same time,

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.620
literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.540
The more viewer in the replies being like,

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.020
that's not what's happening right here.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.260
Like this is necessary, okay?

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:45.820
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on that.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.300
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:52.220
Move you off this site and into,

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.980
I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.500
So that pretty much confirms to me

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.900
that Vosh doesn't actually care

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.580
about advocating for trans people

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.940
and just uses trans rights as a pretext

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.380
to act like a fucking dingus.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.380
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.180
because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.620
The point I'm trying to make is,

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.980
I have no qualms about calling out people on my side

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.380
whenever they go too far or cross a line

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.580
or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.820
about how I don't understand tactical misogyny, idiot.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.220
But the same cannot be said of J.K. Rowling.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.420
I have never once seen her call out

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.540
any of the bigotry and abusiveness

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:30.260
that is absolutely rampant in the gender critical movement.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.500
There's a great video called J.K. Rowling's New Friends

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.380
by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:40.180
of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.440
versus the abusive trans mob.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:45.020
A framing that the witch trials of J.K. Rowling

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.980
accepts uncritically, citing numerous examples

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.060
of death threats and abusiveness from trans advocates.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.300
Things like, kill turfs 2014.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:57.260
How about slowly and horrendously murder turfs

01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.180
in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.820
Now, I don't think anyone should joke

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.920
about putting people in saw traps,

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.560
but also, how serious is this threat

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.560
that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.800
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.120
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.120
has a Tumblr account and is threatening turfs?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.600
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.960
and abusiveness from anti-trans bigots.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.480
I can fill the screen up with examples

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.440
just from people who J.K. Rowling

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.200
has explicitly supported or interacted with.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.960
I will drive you out into the desert

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.800
and bury you nine feet down, one tweet says,

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.480
from a fan of J.K. Rowling.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.940
First, I'll set you on fire

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.080
and piss on your half-alive corpse.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.220
Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.760
Another threat from the same user

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.500
is so graphically violent and sexual,

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.480
I don't know if I can even read it aloud

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.040
without violating the YouTube terms of service.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.560
But threats like this from the gender-critical side

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.200
are simply not mentioned in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.240
Both Rowling and Megan seem happy

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.320
to cherry-pick threatening tweets

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.600
and soundbites of shouting protesters.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.080
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.400
You look like you've got your teeth

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.320
knocked out of your fucking fascist!

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.040
As evidence that the trans movement

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.360
is dangerous and insidious to the core.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.560
But this exact technique has been used

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.120
against literally every liberation movement in world history.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.600
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.720
the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.200
which first got J.K. Rowling

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.800
interested in feminism in the 1970s.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.040
Here's how The Guardian,

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.560
Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.920
covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.600
Chanting slogans against rape

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.640
seems reasonable to promote awareness,

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.480
but what about the hissing and swearing

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.480
at any innocent male and cries of castrate men?

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.600
We were all sympathetic to the principles

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.480
of the women's liberation movement,

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.840
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women,

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.320
when it became clear that my friend's brother

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.000
was running the risk of personal mutilation

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.360
if he remained with us.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.480
The protesters were allegedly singing,

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:16.360
here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.420
So this is how the British press

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.880
covered the women's movement.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.760
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming, castrate men!

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.900
Now, is that a fair representation of the women's movement?

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.500
Should we judge every movement

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.660
by its most militant extremists?

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.460
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanas,

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:38.160
who shot Andy Warhol, who advocated for male extermination

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.140
in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.580
is representative of feminism as a whole?

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:46.980
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:49.220
But it's not fair, is it?

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.100
So why does J.K. Rowling think it's fair

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:52.660
to judge the trans movement

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.220
by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.420
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.860
And I made excuses for you then.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.900
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling,

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.140
Meghan interviews New York Times columnist

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.580
Michelle Goldberg, who has written sympathetically

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.220
about transphobic feminism.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.500
There's a moment in this interview

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.940
where Michelle kind of stumbles into an honest observation

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.620
that I find fascinating.

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:18.140
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:21.140
you know, I'm not gonna debate my basic humanity.

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.420
And part of the difficulty

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.220
is that there are indeed certain issues

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.260
which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:31.060
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.060
And I think that part of what is so difficult

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.620
about this issue is that there are certain people

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.660
who think that this kind of consensus

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:42.380
can be imposed maybe as opposed to evolve organically.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:47.380
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.500
in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:55.100
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed protection

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.420
as other groups whose rights we've decided

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.020
are not up for public conversation.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:01.860
I think the problem is that

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.500
we don't actually have a consensus.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.420
So Michelle correctly observes

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.700
that the reason trans people are often reluctant

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.700
to debate our rights is that we want

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:12.220
the same assumed protections as other groups

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.260
whose rights liberals have decided are not up for debate.

01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:18.180
But then Michelle suggests that trans people

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.140
have to debate our rights

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.820
because there isn't a mainstream consensus

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.220
that we deserve rights.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.300
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.260
thinks that past liberation movements have succeeded.

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.260
Like, does she think that women's suffrage

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.380
just evolved organically?

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:38.020
Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.060
about whether women are intellectually capable of voting

01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:44.220
until all the misogynists were rationally persuaded?

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:47.180
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.180
sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.380
Like, people forget this,

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.420
maybe because they were called suffragettes,

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:54.900
which is kind of a cutesy name,

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.380
but the suffragettes, they murdered people.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.260
They were suffragette terrorists.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:01.820
They broke windows, they bombed churches,

01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.820
they set fire to a theater.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:07.100
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.220
with a horse whip.

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.460
Queen shit, honestly.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.940
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.620
at the Prime Minister's head.

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.860
And my point is not to advocate terrorism

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.540
or to excuse the terrorism of past movements.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.180
I think these kinds of tactics have tended

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.020
to turn people against the movement.

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.460
I don't think it's effective.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.660
But let's not pretend that past movements

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.560
have never made demands before everyone was ready.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.060
Because there never has been,

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.000
and there never will be a time when everyone is ready.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.220
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.540
the Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792,

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.560
and misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.420
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:48.220
and there probably never will be.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.620
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.380
if there was a consensus that we deserve rights.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.860
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you

01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.220
from the kind of people who think you shouldn't have them.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.980
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.580
politely persuade everyone to give us rights,

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.220
but the reality is, that's not how this works,

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.380
and it never has been.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.580
Like, how do these debate me centrists

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.300
think that slavery ended in the United States?

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.980
Well, between 1861 and 1865,

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:19.900
there was a little event called the American Civil Debate.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.420
See what I'm holding in my hand?

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.500
This is a high-caliber idea

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.660
that I picked off the polite discussion field of Manassas.

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.100
Do you people think that American schools were integrated

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.140
because all the white people in the South were persuaded

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.900
that segregation is bad?

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.900
No, dum-dums.

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.320
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.260
to enforce that shit at gunpoint.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.020
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.220
with black civil rights.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.340
I am aware that being a white queer person

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.020
is not in any way equivalent

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.140
to living in the aftermath of slavery.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.700
I'm just saying that there's this tendency

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.440
to sanitize history and to imagine

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.980
that progress was smooth and bloodless,

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.960
that consensus evolved organically, when it just didn't.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.420
And then people get the impression that current movements

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.140
are somehow more militant than successful past movements

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.380
when they just aren't.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.940
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:15.540
misogynistic movement, a cultural movement

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.940
that was illiberal in its methods.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:22.940
And I believe absolutely that there is something dangerous

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.540
about this movement and it must be challenged.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.420
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:32.080
Chapter seven, why is J.K. Rowling like this?

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.700
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.700
whom I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.720
I myself favor violence, deeply.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:46.200
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.680
which I don't agree with.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.520
But she was an interesting writer,

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.360
one of those half-crazed savants who gets in your head,

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.080
who you can't stop thinking about.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.320
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right-Wing Women,

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.680
published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.960
and Anita Bryant.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.300
Right-Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.560
are drawn to conservative politics,

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.920
seemingly against their own interests.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.880
Anyone who's interested in understanding

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.560
the gender-critical movement,

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.480
a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.040
as feminism, should read this book.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.440
In Dworkin's analysis,

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.780
the political right makes certain metaphysical

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.740
and material promises to women that both exploit

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.980
and quiet some of women's deepest fears.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.220
No one can bear to live a meaningless life.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.320
Women fight for meaning just as women fight for survival.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.080
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.560
The right offers women a simple, fixed,

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.200
predetermined social, biological, and sexual order.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.000
Form conquers chaos.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.840
Form banishes confusion.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.240
The gender-critical movement offers women

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.540
a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.960
A woman is an adult human female.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.320
Right-wing anti-trans activist Posie Parker

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.600
has made this phrase into the motto

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.480
of the gender-critical movement.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.760
Adult human female.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.200
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts,

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.240
it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.440
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.080
it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.340
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:26.600
there can be no change.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.640
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.160
and chaos that gender-criticals fear.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.000
The same fear that once drove homophobic women

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.480
like Anita Bryant.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.560
It's just biologically that God made mothers

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.760
so that we could reproduce.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.800
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.160
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.320
of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.520
Dworkin says,

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.440
Within the frame of male domination,

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.320
there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.800
both male and female.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.520
Women are interchangeable as sex objects.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.280
Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.280
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.680
Having children is the one social contribution

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.060
credited to women.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.680
It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.440
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.920
Homosexuality for women means having nothing,

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.600
it means extinction.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.180
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.880
and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:29.440
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.440
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.520
The producer of the large gametes.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.560
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.840
is the loss of fertility.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.440
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.680
attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.360
makes women expendable.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.840
The one thing women can do and be valued for

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.640
will no longer be valued.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.460
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:01.840
because it suggests a world without women altogether,

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.960
a world in which women are extinct.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.800
This exact fear appears frequently

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.400
in gender-critical rhetoric.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.920
Trans activists are erasing women.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.520
They're erasing biological sex.

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.400
They're going to call us pregnant people.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.160
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.560
Trans women are going to replace biological women.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.680
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.520
are aggressively replacing women.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.400
You will not replace us!

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.920
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.440
and the results can be dazzling.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.440
In September 2022, Maya Forstater,

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.920
who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.880
whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.120
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.720
because the Hertfordshire County Libraries

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.040
announced they were changing their children's

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:55.640
storytime mascot from the Bookstart Bear,

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.040
if you don't know where this is going,

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.720
strap in from the Bookstart Bear

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.720
to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature called Tala.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.280
Are you enraged?

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.000
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.480
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.160
who referred to Talia, wait, wasn't it Tala?

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:21.840
Referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns.

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.880
Describing the mascot as ideological,

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.160
creepy, and gaslighting.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.920
I cannot express how upset I feel.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.800
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala, not Talia,

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.440
isn't trans, they are an alien.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.200
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:44.800
Did it hatch from an egg or was it born from a mama?

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.840
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.520
There's an advantage in having a character

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.720
that isn't identifiably male or female,

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.000
as it can be equally relatable to either sex

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.200
and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.480
But Maya was not convinced.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.960
It seems highly unlikely that an alien

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.520
that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.480
is not sexually reproducing.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.000
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.400
not a slime mold.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:15.280
I need to know how the alien fucks right now.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:20.200
I said I need to know how the alien fucks

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.640
before I can show it to my child.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:28.640
When Twitter, understandably, laughed it up

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.480
at Maya's expense, she just kept posting.

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.600
And she posted hard.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.320
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.640
anyone post so hard.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.880
In a lengthy diatribe, Maya wrote about

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880
the miseries of new motherhood.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.680
You are in charge of a baby.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.280
You have never done this before.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.440
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.640
and won't for years.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.640
Everyone has an opinion on what you are doing

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.200
right and wrong, and you've become invisible.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.640
You had politics.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.960
You had a career.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.520
You had interests.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.960
You had a sex life.

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.520
Now, you have the daily needs

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.360
of a completely dependent person,

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.000
and your world has shrunk.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.800
The fact that these men and the young women

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.760
that cheer them on think this is so laughable

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.440
reflects society's disdain for mothers.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.880
This is what it means to say

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.240
a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.120
This is why the hub of the resistance is on Mumsnet.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.280
So, I am fascinated by this thread.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.480
I think it's one of the most revealing texts

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.000
in gender-critical history.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.400
Because you know what?

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.920
Maya Forstater actually does have valid concerns.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.280
But the concerns she has that are valid

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.480
have nothing to do with trans people.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.680
And they definitely have nothing to do

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.480
with an adorable cartoon alien.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.880
Honestly, reading this, I have some concerns.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.480
Concerns like, where is Maya's husband?

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.960
I know she has one.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.320
Isn't raising children supposed to be a mutual project?

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.040
No one should have to feel this alone, raising children.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.200
That is a valid concern.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.840
Oh my God, we actually found one.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.520
It's like finding El Dorado.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.240
A valid concern.

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.240
A valid concern.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.520
Isn't what's going on here

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.680
that Maya is taking legitimate feelings

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:12.440
of being overburdened and underappreciated

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.520
and displacing those feelings onto transgender people?

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.720
This is exactly how the gender-critical movement recruits,

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.280
by providing a scapegoat to frustrated women.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.040
It's not your husband's neglect.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.920
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.120
It's not the indignities of aging.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.680
It's Tala, the non-binary alien,

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:36.840
with its dungarees and smug aura of gender neutrality.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.520
Mumsnet is the hub of the resistance to non-binary cartoons.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.120
It's too much, these people are too much.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.700
Okay, we have to be serious now.

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.940
The political right also promises women safety and security.

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:51.740
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.220
The right acknowledges the reality of danger,

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:55.700
the validity of fear.

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.780
The right then manipulates the fear.

01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:00.180
Women fear and resent male violence,

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:02.220
which they're most likely to experience

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.340
from the men closest to them,

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.980
boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.740
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:13.180
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:16.140
means that women's legitimate fears and resentments

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:19.700
often cannot be directed at the men with power.

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.500
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.100
and contempt they feel for the men who actually abuse them,

01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:29.420
those close to them, and project it onto others,

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.540
those far away, foreign, or different.

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.460
And this displacement of rage

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:38.100
is just transparently what's going on with J.K. Rowling.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.220
In her essay about sex and gender issues,

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:44.660
Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:47.220
to be the son her father wanted.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.220
I really felt the rejection of my father,

01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.380
and that is one of the things

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.220
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:55.500
And she describes the lingering trauma

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.700
from her first violent marriage.

01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:00.020
The marriage at this point has turned very violent

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.380
and very controlling.

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:05.180
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.940
against the transgender movement.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.540
If you try to understand this rationally,

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:12.700
it looks like a total non sequitur.

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.660
But if you look at it emotionally,

01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.420
there's a kind of logic to it.

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:18.540
The existence of the dangerous outsider

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.860
always functions for women simultaneously

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.700
as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.

01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.700
Women cling to irrational hatreds

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.220
focused particularly on the unfamiliar

01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.180
so that they will not murder their fathers,

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:33.620
husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.500
the men with whom they are intimate,

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.380
those who do hurt them.

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:40.380
In the 1970s, many conservative women

01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.060
displaced this rage onto lesbians,

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.220
the threatening outsider of the day.

01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:49.340
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.220
where she spoke to a lot of women

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:53.580
about their fear of lesbians.

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:56.380
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.220
as if lesbians were rapists,

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.300
certified committers of sexual assault

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:01.580
against women and girls.

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:04.940
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.980
experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.940
hovering closer and closer.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.460
She was the dangerous intruder, encroaching,

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.220
threatening by her very presence a sexual order

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.460
that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.340
It's almost surreal to read this

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.260
because of how precisely it describes

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:27.020
how gender-criticals talk about trans women.

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.860
Pronouns are like Rohypnol.

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.340
They dull your defenses.

01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.180
They change your inhibitions.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.100
They're meant to.

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:36.940
Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:41.180
began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.700
with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.180
that transsexualism should be morally mandated

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.620
out of existence.

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:51.980
But the gender-critical movement

01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.380
was always destined to become a right-wing movement

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.700
because it has the structure of a right-wing movement,

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:01.900
taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:05.500
and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:09.100
The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.020
for conservatives to pass up.

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.060
As Dworkin says,

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.380
Because women so displace their rage,

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:17.700
they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.260
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.420
The right provides these symbols of danger

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.380
by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.900
as sources of danger.

01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:32.180
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a keystone

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:35.540
of conservative party platforms, both in the UK,

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.820
where Lee Anderson,

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.940
deputy chair of the Conservative Party,

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.380
predicts that the next election will be won on

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.740
and in the US,

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:47.980
where the ACLU is currently tracking

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.620
more than 450 anti-LGBT bills,

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:55.180
including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:59.020
51 trans sports bans, 40 drag bans,

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:00.940
29 trans bathroom bans,

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:04.540
and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.580
Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.620
to eliminationist extremes

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:12.100
that have most trans people in this country

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.060
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.140
Transgenderism must be eradicated

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.380
from public life entirely.

01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.500
The left is attacking our children,

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.900
pushing sex talk, transgender extremism,

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.380
and noxious politics in our schools.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.740
We should reject this demonic assault

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.580
on the innocence of our children

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.060
and stand fast against leftist efforts

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.460
to mutilate their bodies and minds.

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.980
Stop confusing our babies

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:43.820
with your groomer gender ideologue.

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.420
I will revoke every Biden policy

01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.780
promoting the chemical castration

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.540
and sexual mutilization of our youth.

01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:57.300
And ask Congress to send me a bill

01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:01.180
prohibiting child sexual mutilation

01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.900
in all 50 states.

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:07.340
On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:10.220
on so-called gender-affirming care.

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.140
Ridiculous.

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.100
I will sign a new executive order

01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100
instructing every federal agency

01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.100
to cease all programs

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.340
that promote the concept of sex

01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:22.100
and gender transition at any age.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:25.340
A few gender-criticals still want to insist

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:26.900
they have nothing to do

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.180
with right-wing anti-trans bigots,

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:30.340
like Helen Lewis.

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.020
I mean, TERF is basically which.

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:33.540
Who attempts in her interview

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.540
in The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling

01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:38.700
to distinguish between the transphobia of the far right

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.420
and that of feminists.

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:42.580
I think the hardest thing for outsiders to understand

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.060
is that there are two different arguments going on.

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.340
One is the traditional conservative right argument,

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.060
which is anti-LGBT.

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.500
The other one is a criticism from the left

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.260
in which it says,

01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.900
sometimes male people and female people

01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:58.540
have different interests,

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.700
no matter how the male people identify.

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.220
But as a trans person, I don't care

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.100
whether you justify your transphobia

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.580
in the name of protecting women or protecting children.

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.900
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.500
calling for transsexualism

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.260
to be morally mandated out of existence,

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.660
or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles

01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:19.260
calling for transgenderism

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:21.380
to be eradicated from public life,

01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:23.940
is the same repulsive bigotry to me.

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.700
And in any case, the gender critical movement

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.820
has recently reached an implicit consensus

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.820
that they're mostly done pretending to be feminist.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.580
The rising star of the movement, Posey Parker,

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.020
aka Kelly J. Keene-Menschel,

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.140
rejects feminism entirely.

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:42.060
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:42.900
No.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:43.740
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.420
I probably did for a short time.

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.660
But so you wouldn't be said

01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:48.740
like a Julie Bindle type feminist?

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:49.900
No, well, some feminists,

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:53.380
I mean, Julie Bindle has been critical of mothers

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:55.700
in the past, and I think that's a theme

01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:56.940
flowing through feminism.

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.460
I'm not a feminist!

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.740
I'm not a feminist!

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:02.260
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.980
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:05.980
Parker's campaign is currently funded

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:07.620
by the right-wing CPAC.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.820
CPAC came along and said that they would sponsor our events

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:15.140
and cover all of our insurance throughout our whole trip,

01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:17.500
which is really kind of them.

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:18.940
But what we would need to do

01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:21.340
is we would need to show that we were working for them,

01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:22.860
working with them.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.940
She has no qualms about collaborating

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.940
with far-right white nationalists.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.340
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:30.820
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:35.660
She's a Republican, but I agree with her wholeheartedly.

01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.740
She's opposed abortion and contraception for teenagers.

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:42.220
Why are we enabling children

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:47.220
to take sometimes contraceptives that are quite harmful

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:49.340
or access to abortion?

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:54.540
I think that we really need to rethink all of this.

01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:57.220
I think parents need to take back control of their children.

01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:00.180
She's called trans people fools and perverts.

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:03.220
Transgenderism is nuts.

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.460
It's for fools and perverts.

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.940
She's denied that transgender is a legitimate concept.

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:10.420
It's not a real thing.

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:12.780
There's no such thing as being born in the wrong body.

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.260
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.420
There's no such thing as a trans person.

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:17.420
There is no such thing.

01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:20.300
There are people that call themselves these things

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.580
that may have other issues manifesting

01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.660
that then make them think they're this, but no.

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.460
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.180
There may be more words that we have to say

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.100
in order to say that.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.460
We may call it transgender ideology,

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:35.980
but when it comes to a person,

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.460
they may be following transgender ideology,

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.020
but they are not transgender.

01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:42.540
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.740
being anything other than a man or a woman.

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:47.260
She's called trans women pedophiles.

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.700
We know that if a man has a paraphilia

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.380
of dressing as a woman,

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:56.020
the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.900
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.540
They don't ever stop at one.

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.500
She's said that each and every woman

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:06.740
who stands in her way will be annihilated.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:10.380
Each and every one of you women who stand in my way,

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.860
each and every one of you,

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:14.660
let me just tell you, you will be annihilated.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:18.780
She's called on armed men to enter women's restrooms

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.380
to attack anyone they perceive as not a real woman.

01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:26.340
And men, for once, I'm talking to you.

01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:32.620
I'm talking about you dads who maybe carry,

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.540
I think that's what you say.

01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.460
I'm so done with the American lingo.

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.900
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.740
Maybe you consider yourself a protector of women.

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:44.260
Maybe you're that sort of man.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.220
Maybe you have a sister or a mother or a wife.

01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:49.300
Maybe you have a sister, maybe you just have some friends.

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.940
Maybe you just think women are human

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:55.380
and you don't need any absolute connection with them

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.940
to feel compelled to protect us.

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.660
I think you should start using women's toilets, men.

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:06.180
And she's said that women who call themselves men

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.900
should be sterilized,

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.340
which seems to be a little bit in tension

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:12.500
with J.K. Rowling's concern

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.380
about the fertility of confused girls.

01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.100
You know, you might look at these differences of opinion

01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.780
between Rowling and Parker,

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:23.660
little things like pro-feminist versus anti-feminist,

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.620
left versus right, pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:30.300
concern about trans men's fertility

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:34.420
versus advocating forced sterilization of trans men,

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:37.380
against annihilating women who stand in your way

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:42.140
versus pro-annihilating each and every woman

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.820
who stands in your way.

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.180
You might look at these differences

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.100
and expect that these two women would be at odds,

01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.100
but they aren't.

01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:53.020
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry is a common cause

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.220
that for both of them trumps all else.

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.980
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.140
reading I heart J.K. Rowling

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.940
to be displayed at a railway station in Edinburgh.

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:07.700
And Rowling has tweeted in defense of Parker numerous times

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.980
and has modeled her t-shirts.

01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.820
So the gender critical movement

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:16.140
started by lesbian separatists in the 1970s

01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:20.300
has finally passed into the hands of pound shop Ava Browns,

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.820
as gender critical lesbian, Julie Bindle,

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:24.540
memorably described them.

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.860
It's a movement that has no beliefs

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.140
apart from a shared determination

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:31.540
to reduce the number of trans people.

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:33.180
In the numbers we're currently seeing,

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.020
particularly of young people coming forward,

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.660
I find cause for doubt.

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.020
In the meantime,

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.580
while we're trying to get through to the decision makers,

01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:43.900
we have to try to limit the harm.

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.500
And that means reducing or keeping down

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.900
the number of people who transition.

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:50.020
And that's for two reasons.

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.940
One of them is that every one of those people

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.180
is a person who's been damaged.

01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.900
But the second one is every one of those people

01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:01.900
is basically, you know, a huge problem to a sane world.

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.820
Like if you've got people,

01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:04.780
whether they're transitioned,

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:05.900
whether they're happily transitioned,

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.140
whether they're unhappily transitioned,

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.780
whether they're de-transitioned,

01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:10.420
if you've got people who've dissociated

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:12.780
from their sex in some way,

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.740
every one of those people

01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.140
is someone who needs special accommodation

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:19.980
in a sane world where we re-acknowledge the truth of sex.

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.700
So to wrap this up,

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:25.340
is the backlash against J.K. Rowling a witch hunt?

01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:28.020
Unequivocally, no.

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.340
It's very thoroughly deserved.

01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.740
But I will say this,

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:34.500
a movement can't get along without a devil.

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.900
And across the whole political spectrum,

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:41.220
there's a misogynistic tendency to choose a female devil,

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:44.220
whether it's Anita Bryant, Hillary Clinton,

01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:49.220
Marie Antoinette, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or J.K. Rowling.

01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.820
And there's always gonna be people

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:54.300
who seize on any opportunity to be misogynistic.

01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:57.980
So I would advise trans people and our allies

01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:00.540
to keep in mind that J.K. Rowling

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.500
is not the final boss of transphobia.

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.100
She's not our devil.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.940
The devil is the Republican Party, the conservative party.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.940
The devil is patriarchy.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.460
It's the right-wing men who will be the ones

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:17.220
to put gender-critical theory into brutal practice.

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:21.300
Anita Bryant, Posey Parker, and J.K. Rowling are,

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.460
to borrow a term from TERFs, handmaidens.

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.220
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.820
They're useful idiots who put a concerned female face

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.700
on the patriarchal violence against trans people

01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.900
that will ultimately be enacted by right-wing men.

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:40.340
I call on men to consider themselves decent human beings

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:42.780
to call out the deviants among them

01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:46.780
and eradicate these monsters from society.

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:50.820
And Megan Phelps Roper and Centra Slayker are wrong

01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:54.100
that civil conversation can resolve this.

01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.340
Call out the deviants among them

01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.420
and eradicate these monsters from society.

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.540
People like Michael Knowles and Ron DeSantis

01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:06.540
and Donald Trump cannot be persuaded.

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.580
They have to be defeated.

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.300
As for what to do about J.K. Rowling,

01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:14.300
honestly, let's all just block her.

01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:16.820
Open up Twitter right now, go to her profile,

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.140
and just block her.

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.340
Problem solved.

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.500
Like, don't harass her, that doesn't help.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:24.100
But also, I wouldn't wait for her to change.

01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:27.060
She's gone down what I call the bigotry whirlpool.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.740
The deeper you go in, the harder it is to leave.

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:32.820
For the same reasons that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.100
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:38.140
One of the most insidious elements of a confidence scam

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.700
is that the victims who invested the most

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:43.020
are often the most passionate defenders

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.380
because shame is a powerful force in the human psyche

01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.420
and they can't bear the shame of admitting they were tricked.

01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.020
Reformed bigots have to face

01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.220
not only the shame of being dupes,

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.860
but also the guilt of having devoted years of life

01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:57.660
to harming vulnerable people.

01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:00.820
This is something Megan, to her credit, phased head on.

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:04.020
If we were wrong, then I had spent every day of my life

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:07.340
industriously sowing doom, discord, and rage

01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:11.700
to so many not at the behest of God, but of my grandfather.

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.980
I had wasted my life only to fill others

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.780
with pain and misery.

01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.860
Most bigots cannot stand to face this moral sunk cost.

01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.540
It's why an obsessive bigot like Graham Linehan,

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.620
whose all-consuming hatred of trans people

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:27.180
has ruined his life, cost him his marriage,

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.060
and left him alone to tweet about

01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.940
destroying gender ideology minutes before midnight

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.100
on New Year's Eve, feels psychologically compelled

01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:37.320
to insist with ever more certainty

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.140
that trans people are not just delusional or dangerous,

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:42.300
but are all demonic perverts,

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.620
and enemies so hyperbolically evil

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:47.420
that they justify his self-immolating crusade.

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.700
They took everything from me, you know.

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:56.060
They took my family, you know?

01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:57.580
And I just said, no, hang on a sec.

01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.740
Stop calling these women TERFs.

01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.660
Stop sending them abuse.

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.020
Let them speak.

01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:07.340
And for that, they just destroyed me.

01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.860
Do you honestly feel destroyed?

01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:12.020
No, because the one thing about this,

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.380
the one thing about this that keeps me going

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:16.820
is that I know I'm right, you know?

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:17.700
I know I'm right.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:20.980
As long as he stays here in the bottom of the whirlpool,

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:23.740
he never has to face that he's ruined his relationships

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:27.620
and wasted years of life because he just couldn't let it go.

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.380
And if J.K. Rowling doesn't log off soon,

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.620
this will likely be her fate as well.

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:36.460
I guess what I'm really trying to say is,

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:38.460
Harry Potter's dead to me.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.460
I'm switching to Twilight.
