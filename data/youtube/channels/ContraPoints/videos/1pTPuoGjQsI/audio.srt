1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,240
rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
Thank you, it breathed hoarsely.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,680
I smirked and nodded and stepped backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,160
knackery, hairy, baringered paw that clutched it.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,360
The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the stubble

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,680
was already burgeoning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,880
pairs of false eyelashes.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,680
Against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy scarf-dress swung a polished

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,600
steel woman's liberation emblem.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,560
I should have said, you're a man.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,360
The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Poof!

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Let's go, adult human females.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,360
ðŸŽµ

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,400
First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
here today, get out.

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,280
which case like, comment, subscribe.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
radical feminists.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,480
You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,400
are lost lesbian sisters.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,760
You guys do know about trans men, right?

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,280
Male-to-female is not the only type of transgender person.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,160
There's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned.

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,080
People who were always.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,480
People who identify.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,920
TERFs don't like being called TERFs, they think it's a term of disparagement, which

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
it is.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,040
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,920
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,160
construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,560
In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,000
bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,760
And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,960
want to be balanced.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,440
So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,360
used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,420
And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,920
with men, and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,720
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,160
first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,120
It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,440
And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
would feel that way.

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,240
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,480
And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,800
gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,720
conversation, debate, idea, marketplace, expression, discourse.

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,280
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner radfem.

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,040
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of Jermaine Greer,

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,560
and when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling ex-extra biological,

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,320
and when the full moon shines, she speaks.

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,600
Ugh, this is agony.

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Can you imagine?

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Ugh.

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,680
she doesn't hate trans people, she just has a fewâ€¦ concerns.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,720
You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore, or you're accused

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
of transphobia.

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,320
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we, the public, never

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,000
got a chance to debate.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,480
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are, allowing biological males to

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,080
run rampant in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,680
children with the ludicrous dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,000
She goes on like that for hours, it's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,880
Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,440
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,760
Scholars remain divided.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,040
It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,480
You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,280
consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
It's PC run AMOC.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,040
It's a Hanukkat-astrophe.

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,200
Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
untreated sewage.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure, we

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates of family

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

87
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,520
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
unambiguous slogans.

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
Trans women are women!

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Which is true.

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
We are women.

92
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
But!

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
Ooh, that was a sinister but.

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Watch out for that.

95
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,800
What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,440
people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,880
And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not transfeminism,

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,200
might wonder things like,

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
How can you be a woman without the oppression experiences of girlhood?

100
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,840
Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

101
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,400
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

102
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,520
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time they're

103
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,440
just brandished as weapons against us.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,840
You know, it's like when a man asks,

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,520
If society is so sexist against women, then why is it that men are 97% of combat fatalities,

106
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
feminazis?

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,280
Like you could sit there for three hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,

108
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,700
but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

109
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,840
Because nine times out of ten, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's

110
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,600
just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,520
And the same goes for people telling me,

112
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,160
You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a woman?

113
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,200
Could you define womanhood for me?

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,640
Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

115
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,760
But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,140
and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.

117
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,040
Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,400
In this video I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,880
gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
rather than dogmatic ones.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,

122
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,120
and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly, so if I do fuck

123
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
something up, well, just read me to filth on Twitter like you always do you little shits.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Love you!

125
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,600
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,640
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today,

128
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,520
only the catch is that some of them are actually men.

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
Oops, wrong channel.

130
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
Concern 1. Gender Metaphysics

131
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,640
There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

132
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,800
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.

134
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,560
put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,200
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?

138
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,480
I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,120
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,920
binary transgender identity and cross-sex brain anatomy,

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female brains in male bodies

143
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
or anything like that.

144
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,640
gray and white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies,

146
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,160
distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.

148
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,

149
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,880
in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man,

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
rather than as always having been a woman.

151
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,400
But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile,

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
I am not real and not valid.

153
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,760
But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening

154
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,600
My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.

156
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
I always thought I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man,

157
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
it doesn't matter to me.

158
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman,

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,840
is going around being a woman, as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

160
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Concern 2. Gender Stereotypes

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,840
What do you mean you live as a woman?

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,440
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup,

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
and a fake girly voice?

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Listen sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.

166
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,000
No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same,

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
rather we're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers

168
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
to prompt others to see us for what we are.

169
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,400
why I'm presenting in such a meticulously feminine way,

171
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,880
like they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game,

172
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day,

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall

174
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,560
in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,520
I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,

176
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,640
because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all,

177
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
and they've had to struggle since childhood against a society

178
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
that's told them they have to be feminine.

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
And I completely sympathize with that,

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.

181
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
But also, I've had to fight against the same society

182
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
that told me I should really, really, really not be this.

183
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
So, I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.

184
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,080
Concern three, abolish gender.

185
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,240
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,

186
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
not conforming to them.

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,520
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

188
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
Abolish gender?

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual,

190
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,320
but, I mean, I'll give it a try.

191
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Solanus, be praised!

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,360
No nails, no makeup, I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

193
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,240
I did it everyone, I abolished gender!

194
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier,

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
so I should probably get rid of that.

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
How is she though?

197
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
She's feeling a little genderless.

198
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
I guess the way I position my body is still gendered,

199
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.

200
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
So what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,960
and speak in a genderless robot voice.

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,400
My name is five four six six four one seven,

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,440
I have no gender, patriarchy is over.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
I guess English is still patriarchal language, right,

205
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,680
so I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,280
I can't stand this, fuck this.

208
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,920
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea,

209
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,640
like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth

210
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
didn't determine what kind of life you could live?

211
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,

212
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
kind of like abolish borders.

213
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,560
Your utopian pipe dream is valid.

214
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,800
And denying trans people their gender identity

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
because abolish gender is kind of like

216
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
denying citizenship to immigrants because abolish borders.

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable

218
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
under the present system,

219
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
and then leveraging that system against them

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
under the pretense of abolishing it.

221
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,080
in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,

223
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,960
why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

224
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
You should be abolishing gender,

225
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

226
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,520
No, they don't attack the gender expression of people

227
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,880
with power and influence.

228
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,

229
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,640
and calling her a creepy man,

231
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,720
and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,

232
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.

233
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
It's almost like when they say abolish gender,

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
what they really mean is abolish trans people.

235
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,880
It's almost like this is a hate movement

236
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,760
hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.

237
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,080
But surely, I must be missing something.

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,600
Concern four, male privilege.

239
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself

241
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,480
without living any of the struggle that entails.

242
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,000
So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,280
In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.

244
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,880
I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.

245
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
So I don't like to complain about every little

246
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
microaggression I experience,

247
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
because under the circumstances,

248
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,400
it just seems a little gauche.

249
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
And I don't like things that are gauche.

250
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
But I've had cis-feminists of my race and class

251
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
tell me that I have no idea what it's like

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
to be talked over and interrupted by men.

253
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
Actually, Kropotkin.

254
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Or to experience street harassment,

255
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,400
or to have to treat every first date

256
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,720
like a potentially life-threatening situation,

257
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,760
and it's just bizarre to me that they think that.

258
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

259
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
You think men treat me as their equal?

260
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
You think street harassers are gonna treat me

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,960
with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?

262
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,920
Hey, beautiful.

263
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
Where you going, baby?

264
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,080
Where you going?

265
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Oh, it's tranny.

266
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,120
Excuse me, sir, my mistake.

267
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,520
Please, proceed freely to your destination.

268
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,360
Come on, people.

269
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
Use your heads.

270
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,880
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,

271
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
what do you think the guy in the steps

272
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
of the liquor store is gonna say?

273
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
When a trans woman doesn't pass,

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,840
it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

275
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,920
No, you get treated as monster gender,

276
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
pronouns it and spit,

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
and male privilege is not a good description

278
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
of that experience at all.

279
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
Once you start passing as a woman,

280
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,

281
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,120
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

282
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,960
of the whole notion of passing.

284
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,880
They think they can always clock a tran,

285
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
and they assume everyone else can too.

286
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
But that's just not reality.

287
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
I mean, I'm only a year and a half into my transition,

288
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
and at this point I've had zero surgeries,

289
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
and it's been like six months

290
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,120
since I was last misgendered offline.

291
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
I mean, a person with a good eye for it

292
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,920
will probably clock me,

293
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated

294
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
into politically correct gender ideology,

295
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,960
but like, you really think the gas station attendant

296
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,520
and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

297
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,520
are all calling me miss and ma'am because of postmodernism?

298
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,880
I know some of you are gonna sneak off

299
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
to your shitty little radfem forums

300
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
and obsess over how manly and clockable I am,

301
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,560
but like, at the end of the day,

302
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
what am I gonna trust?

303
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,400
The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,

304
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,680
or every social interaction I've had for months.

305
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

306
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm ahi tuna, and you're a mackerel sweaty.

307
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,760
Take a fucking sip, babes.

308
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,680
I love that.

309
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
Concern five, male socialization.

310
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,520
So you had a male upbringing,

311
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,680
you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,

312
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,760
you benefited from male privilege for decades,

313
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
and now you think none of that matters?

314
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,680
You are who you are because of how you were socialized,

315
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
not because of how you dress.

316
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,520
All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.

317
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

318
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,960
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled

319
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
as a nine-year-old girl,

320
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
or what that does to a child's psyche.

321
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me

322
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,160
until I was an adult,

323
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,400
when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.

324
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,720
That's very different from what cis women go through.

325
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,960
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common

326
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,040
with a typical man than a typical woman,

327
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
and many of my experiences from those days

328
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,240
I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

329
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
I absolutely benefited from male privilege,

330
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
and it did influence who I was,

331
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
and who I was in my late teens and early twenties

332
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,400
was an anti-feminist shithead

333
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
who had no idea what women go through.

334
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,400
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,

335
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,680
because in trans discourse,

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,400
it's just accepted as obvious that trans men

337
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,240
know what it's like to be raised as women,

338
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

339
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880
But when it comes to the early life experiences

340
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,640
of trans women, we're supposed to say,

341
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,760
when I was five years old,

342
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,360
I loved wearing my mom's high heels,

343
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
or else say nothing at all.

344
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,

345
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
where she describes the way living as a woman

346
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
stifles an adventurous spirit,

347
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,520
and her longing for a male experience.

348
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,920
Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,

349
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
sailors and soldiers,

350
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
barroom regulars,

351
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
to be part of a scene,

352
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,280
anonymous, listening, recording.

353
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,160
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,

354
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
a female,

355
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,400
always supposedly in danger of assault and battery.

356
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,920
My consuming interest in men and their lives

357
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,840
is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,

358
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,480
or as an invitation to intimacy.

359
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,800
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

360
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,520
I want to be able to sleep in an open field,

361
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
to travel West,

362
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,560
to walk freely at night.

363
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,680
So I got to do all that in my early 20s,

364
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
and what I discovered is,

365
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,880
I hate sleeping in open fields,

366
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
I despise the West,

367
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,640
and I'd really rather stay inside,

368
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
collecting ceramics and sucking dick.

369
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman,

370
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,320
and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man

371
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,880
because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews

372
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,800
for reasons that are inconceivable to me.

373
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,600
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-20s,

374
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,920
I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,

375
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
body, and sexual persona

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
that were drastically wrong for me,

377
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
and I tried every possible alternative to transitioning

378
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
before realizing that I had an irrepressible need

379
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,120
to become a woman.

380
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
So I changed,

381
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
and when I changed,

382
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,440
society's treatment of me changed.

383
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Socialization doesn't end with childhood,

384
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
it's a lifelong process.

385
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,960
For example, when I transitioned,

386
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,680
my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,

387
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,360
and radical feminist haters

388
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
started commenting on my physical appearance

389
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
about 20 to 30 times more often,

390
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
and I had to get used to that being something

391
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
that matters a lot more.

392
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,200
That said, resocialization takes time,

393
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,920
and sometimes trans people who are early in transition

394
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,680
have most of that process ahead of them.

395
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,360
I also think we have to take into account

396
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,520
the age at which a person transitions.

397
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Kim Petras, whomst we stan,

398
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,800
we stan,

399
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,080
I stan,

400
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
oh we stan!

401
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,560
She transitioned as a child,

402
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,480
and I imagine was socialized more or less

403
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,680
the same as a cis woman.

404
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,760
Whereas Caitlyn Jenner, whomst,

405
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,260
well,

406
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,560
just whomst.

407
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,480
She made millions of dollars in men's sports,

408
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
she had six children by three wives,

409
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
she transitioned in retirement at age 65,

410
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
and told BuzzFeed that the hardest part of being a woman

411
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
is figuring out what to wear.

412
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.

413
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
It makes me want to cry.

414
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,

415
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue

416
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective

417
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,920
doesn't have a leg to stand on.

418
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,960
But also, trans women often don't experience

419
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
male socialization the way cis men do.

420
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Many trans women are feminine and queer

421
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
before they transition,

422
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
and have always experienced a kind of fem-phobia

423
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,760
that is rooted in misogyny.

424
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
Some trans women also identified as women

425
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,120
years before transitioning,

426
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,760
and internalized society's messaging about women

427
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
more than society's messaging about men.

428
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,920
Now that's still not the same as living in society

429
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,280
as a girl from birth,

430
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,680
but it's also pretty different from the socialization

431
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,880
of most cis men.

432
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,120
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue

433
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
that trans women never experience male privilege

434
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege

435
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
as a proxy for calling us men.

436
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
Pull up your zipper.

437
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,000
Your male privilege is hanging out.

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point

439
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,480
for many gender-critical feminists

440
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,040
is that there's an element here of stolen valor,

441
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,440
this sense of injustice that people are claiming

442
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
their identity without experiencing their oppression.

443
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,080
It reminds me of what in the trans community

444
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
are called transmedicalists,

445
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,400
people who insist the only real trans people

446
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,720
are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

447
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing

448
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,920
that confirms your identity is pain.

449
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,800
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

450
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,000
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

451
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

452
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
You don't know what it's like.

453
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying

454
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,240
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity

455
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
so stigmatized that most of the people

456
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,840
who are attracted to you in private

457
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
are too ashamed to admit it in public.

458
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
You don't know what it's like to have a body

459
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,040
so non-normative that you're shut out

460
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
of whole areas of society.

461
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,920
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest

462
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,680
does nothing but to provoke infighting

463
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
between trans women and cis women

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
at a time when we should be marching side by side

465
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,680
to destroy video games forever.

466
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
Hashtag yes all gamers.

467
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,640
What, what, what?

468
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,360
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

469
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
You don't know what it's like to grow up

470
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
being shamed for your periods, to fear unwanted pregnancy,

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to have to fight for your right to abortion,

472
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
to bear the pain of childbirth.

473
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Well, yeah, that's true.

474
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,800
My inner Radfem sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

475
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,720
I do think it's important for trans women

476
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,480
to stand in solidarity with cis women

477
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
on issues like period equity and abortion rights,

478
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
and to learn about the experiences of cis women

479
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
to form a more complete understanding

480
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,680
of the female condition.

481
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
But of course no individual woman experiences

482
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,920
all the things women experience,

483
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,560
and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood

484
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,000
in drastically different ways.

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
For some women, having babies is the most essentially

486
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
womanly experience.

487
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,000
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

488
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,920
I mean, not actually, but you know,

489
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,840
TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.

490
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails

491
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
in my business inbox from married men

492
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,000
struggling through the existential crisis

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,040
of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.

494
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,400
Also, do you want to be a guest

495
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,560
on my podcast Free Speech Radio?

496
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,200
But also, not all women experience their womanhood

497
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
as essentially oppressive,

498
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
or centered around the pain of reproductive capacity.

499
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
When Shania Twain sang Man, I Feel Like a Woman,

500
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,680
she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion

501
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,320
in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

502
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,800
Man, I feel like shit.

503
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,280
["I Feel Like a Woman"]

504
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.

505
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary

506
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,280
needed to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.

507
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,920
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people

508
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,360
and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.

509
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,560
Well, I, for one, am not a menstruator.

510
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,440
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.

511
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,720
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator

512
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
or pregnant people and are thinking,

513
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,800
what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak

514
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,480
gender cuckoldry is that?

515
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,680
Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.

516
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Some medical organizations have recently begun

517
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480
using the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women.

518
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word

519
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,240
menstruators in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.

520
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,920
This has prompted some conservative,

521
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,760
TERF, and Christian publications

522
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,680
to post panicked commentaries warning

523
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,240
that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

524
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,640
But in fact, medical language that assumes

525
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,560
that everyone with a uterus is a woman

526
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,880
erases trans men, or non-binary people

527
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,480
who menstruate and get pregnant.

528
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,

529
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
whereas saying pregnant people includes them

530
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
and cis women and doesn't erase anyone,

531
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
except for Cincinnatians,

532
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
because we all know they're not people.

533
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Take your shitty chili elsewhere.

534
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
But I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.

535
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
What kind of misogynistic madness is it

536
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,520
to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

537
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,760
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator

538
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
sounds pretty dehumanizing,

539
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
and the trans men I've talked to about this

540
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
aren't the biggest fans of it either.

541
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Sometimes it takes a while to settle

542
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,040
on language that's both inclusive and usable,

543
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,360
and my prediction is that menstruators

544
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
is not gonna work out.

545
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
Maybe people who menstruate?

546
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,000
But why can't I just say woman?

547
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
That's what I am.

548
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
You can't just say woman.

549
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
That is what you are.

550
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
No one is asking that you stop referring

551
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,720
to yourself as a woman.

552
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,800
Institutional medical language is designed

553
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,120
to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

554
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,040
No one is proposing that we stop calling

555
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,080
individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.

556
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,040
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

557
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,000
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

558
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680
I notice you're not suggesting doctors

559
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,840
start saying people with prostates.

560
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,240
Though I am definitely suggesting that.

561
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,040
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces

562
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,520
and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.

563
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing

564
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,800
or celebrating periods or wearing pussy hats

565
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,200
at political marches or free-bleeding

566
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,320
all over the National Mall.

567
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
I mean, someone has to.

568
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.

569
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,720
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate

570
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,760
their reproductive anatomy in defiance of a society

571
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

572
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,560
The problem arises only when menstruation

573
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,360
or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men

574
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
or exclude wombs whom stoth not bleed.

575
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
I mean, trans women do bleed,

576
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
but only when we cut ourselves.

577
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,880
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

578
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,000
Concern eight, TERF is a slur.

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,040
TERF is a slur designed to silence women.

580
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,800
Nay, it is hate speech designed

581
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,720
to incite violence against women.

582
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
The word TERF is a pejorative for a person

583
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,

584
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,040
but it's not a slur.

585
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,760
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race,

586
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,680
religion, gender, or sexuality.

587
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
The word misogynist is pejorative,

588
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,520
it has only negative connotations,

589
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.

590
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs,

591
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
not a type of person.

592
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
The same is true of the word TERF.

593
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,480
It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors

594
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,400
that deserve to be derogated.

595
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,280
The term gender-critical is really a euphemism

596
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
recently created to replace TERF

597
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,160
with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.

598
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,040
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race-realist,

599
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,680
which was invented by racists wanting a more flattering

600
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,920
and respectable description of their beliefs.

601
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,320
I've used the term gender-critical in this video

602
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,240
to be inviting to fence-sitters,

603
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
but I refuse to cooperate with racists

604
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,320
who want me to use their euphemisms,

605
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,880
and I generally do the same with TERFs.

606
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,000
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.

607
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
I usually like to call people

608
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
by whatever they want to be called.

609
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,440
But when it comes to race-realist or gender-critical,

610
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
every time I use these phrases,

611
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
I'm essentially becoming an accomplice

612
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,680
in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.

613
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,920
And I have especially little patience

614
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,720
for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,

615
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,880
since most of the language used by TERFs

616
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,

617
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,560
harmful, and insulting to trans people.

618
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,200
For instance, TERFs refer to any and all

619
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
trans-related surgery as mutilation.

620
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
They call trans women TIMs,

621
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,240
an acronym for trans-identified males,

622
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,760
and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,

623
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,800
obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

624
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,360
Just to give you a sample of typical TERF prose,

625
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,640
here are a couple comments

626
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
from literally the first thread I saw

627
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
on the gender-critical subreddit

628
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,520
while I was working on this video.

629
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
And I have to admit to considerably more contempt

630
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
for the likes of ****,

631
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,400
since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,

632
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
insulting to women facial expressions.

633
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,960
I also get a good laugh

634
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
at TIMs putting their hands up to their shins.

635
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,680
They're trying to look all dainty

636
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,520
and to hide their Adam's apple,

637
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
but it only draws more attention

638
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,920
to their enormous man hands.

639
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,280
I saw an AGP photo shoot with this Neanderthal

640
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,280
in his 50s was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,

641
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
his hands dainty at his ear.

642
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,760
In every photo, even group ones at events.

643
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
Now I was just grossed out.

644
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,120
So there it is.

645
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
That's what this is really about.

646
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
In this video, I've gone through a list

647
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,760
of gender-critical concerns,

648
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
and I've provided responses

649
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
I hope the average person will find fair.

650
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,040
But I would be lying to you by omission

651
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,240
if I were to end this video

652
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,680
without being real with you

653
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,400
about what the core of the gender-critical movement

654
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
is actually about.

655
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
See, what TERFs do in public

656
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
is advance what, on the surface,

657
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,920
are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.

658
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
For example, the critique

659
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,400
that hyperfeminine trans women

660
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,560
are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes

661
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,920
designed to oppress women.

662
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
At a glance, this appears to be a critique

663
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,640
of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.

664
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,840
But in the next breath,

665
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,120
these same TERFs will argue

666
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,680
that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts

667
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,480
who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.

668
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
So if trans women being feminine is bad,

669
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
and trans women being masculine is bad,

670
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
then there really is no way

671
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,280
that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.

672
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,440
So in fact, what TERFs really oppose

673
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,200
is not trans women being feminine

674
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,040
or trans women being masculine,

675
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,760
but trans women being trans women.

676
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,600
In other words, the fundamental issue

677
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
underlying all these phony concerns

678
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
is transphobia, simple animosity

679
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,960
towards trans people's very existence.

680
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
And it's pretty easy to recognize that

681
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
just from the tone they use when they talk about us.

682
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
When you read through the gender-critical subreddit

683
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
or TERF Twitter, which you see

684
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes

685
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
draped over a jagged thorn-tangle

686
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,600
of visceral disgust and targeted hate.

687
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
The pure exuberant malice of it all

688
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,560
is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote

689
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,000
from the opening of this video

690
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,400
or in the average gender-critical forum post.

691
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,000
The enormous, snuckly, hairy, beringed paw.

692
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,480
The pancake makeup through which the stubble

693
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,840
was already burgeoning.

694
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
This Neanderthal in his 50s.

695
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,520
Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

696
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Now I was just grossed out.

697
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
What gender-critical feminism really amounts to

698
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,600
is a Baroque palace of rationalizations

699
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,040
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

700
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,600
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

701
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
You know, I came of age when gay marriage

702
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,200
was the most contentious social debate,

703
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
and the arguments people made

704
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,240
that marriage was under attack,

705
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,000
that the children would be traumatized,

706
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,920
that bestiality would be next,

707
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,840
that this tiny minority was undermining

708
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,160
all our institutions with their outrageous demands,

709
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,400
it was all just nonsense.

710
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
If you got a conservative drunk,

711
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
as I used to be able to do,

712
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,920
Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,

713
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,520
he would just blurt out the truth,

714
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,920
which was that the sight of two grown men

715
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,400
locking lips made him wanna bomb.

716
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,000
Homophobia and transphobia

717
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,400
do not originate in the frontal cortex.

718
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,960
They come from the lizard brain disgust response

719
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,560
we evolved to deal with blood,

720
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,200
infection, vomit, feces, flies,

721
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,760
the hairy paw, the stubble burgeoning

722
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
through the pancake makeup.

723
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,

724
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
because it's the same disgust

725
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,800
I felt toward myself for years.

726
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,520
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman

727
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
on the L platform in Chicago five years ago

728
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,600
and decided then and there

729
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,080
to abandon my first attempt at transition.

730
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

731
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,040
It's the disgust that's always

732
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,720
at the bottom of transphobia,

733
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
because transphobia is always the same.

734
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,520
It always comes from the same place,

735
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,320
and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.

736
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,880
I recently rewatched that classic viral video

737
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,560
from an old episode of Cops

738
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
where a police officer humiliates

739
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

740
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID,

741
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,760
misgenders her, deadnames her,

742
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
mocks her clothes and makeup,

743
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
and calls her a crossdresser.

744
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
It's all so repetitive and familiar.

745
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,360
It's the same arsenal of petty sadism

746
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,880
you see in the right-wing press,

747
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
on 4chan, on doxing forums,

748
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
on gender-critical Reddit.

749
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,160
It's all the same.

750
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,640
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair

751
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
is her unbreakable wit and confidence

752
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,480
in the face of transphobic abuse.

753
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,800
The single most iconic moment is when,

754
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,720
after being grilled in the back of the cop car

755
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,200
amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,

756
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
she glances back at the cop and says,

757
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,120
Excuse my beauty.

758
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,080
Excuse your beauty.

759
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,720
Okay.

760
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,400
And that, right there,

761
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,000
is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,

762
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
the resilience of trans women,

763
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,400
the assumption of a regal posture,

764
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
and even the most abject conditions.

765
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,880
And that's really all you can do,

766
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
because there's just no reasoning

767
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,160
a transphobe out of bigotry.

768
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,960
So, to any diehard gender-critical feminists

769
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
still watching this,

770
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,160
what else can I say except,

771
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,920
on behalf of all trans women,

772
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
excuse my beauty.

773
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,560
Turf.

774
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,440
Turf.

775
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,320
Turf.

776
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,280
Turf.

777
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,080
Turf.

778
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:50,240
I posted an invitation to Twitter for people who used to be gender-critical feminists

779
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,640
to chew me in the back of the head.

780
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
It's PC Ron Amac.

781
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
It's PC Ron Amac.

782
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
Look at him.

783
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
It's so stupid.

784
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
It's so stupid.

785
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
It's PC Ron Amac.

786
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Corona Premiere.

787
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Turf beer of choice.

788
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
My chromosomes need to unwind after a hard day of hating trans people.

789
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
It is absurd.

790
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
These titties.

791
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I just saw them and I just lost it.

792
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
I just.

793
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
It's just.

794
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
What?

795
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
What?

796
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
I am a W-M-B-Y-N.

797
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

798
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

799
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

800
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

801
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
No one knows what it's like

802
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
to be a sad trans.

803
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
To be a trash can

804
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
for trap chasers.

805
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
For trap chasers.

806
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Perfect.
