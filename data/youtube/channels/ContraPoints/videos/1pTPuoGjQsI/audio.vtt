00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies

00:07.800 --> 00:10.240
rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.280
Thank you, it breathed hoarsely.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.640
Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.

00:16.640 --> 00:22.680
I smirked and nodded and stepped backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous

00:22.680 --> 00:27.160
knackery, hairy, baringered paw that clutched it.

00:27.160 --> 00:32.360
The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the stubble

00:32.360 --> 00:39.680
was already burgeoning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two

00:39.680 --> 00:42.880
pairs of false eyelashes.

00:42.880 --> 00:48.680
Against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy scarf-dress swung a polished

00:48.680 --> 00:51.600
steel woman's liberation emblem.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.560
I should have said, you're a man.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.360
The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.360
Poof!

01:07.080 --> 01:09.240
Let's go, adult human females.

01:09.240 --> 01:17.360
ðŸŽµ

01:17.360 --> 01:22.400
First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men

01:22.400 --> 01:25.040
here today, get out.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.600
I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in

01:29.600 --> 01:32.280
which case like, comment, subscribe.

01:32.280 --> 01:37.280
So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary

01:37.280 --> 01:38.280
radical feminists.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.480
You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men

01:42.480 --> 01:46.400
are lost lesbian sisters.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.760
You guys do know about trans men, right?

01:48.760 --> 01:51.280
Male-to-female is not the only type of transgender person.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.160
There's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.080
People who were always.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.480
People who identify.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.920
TERFs don't like being called TERFs, they think it's a term of disparagement, which

02:04.920 --> 02:05.920
it is.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.040
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.

02:10.040 --> 02:14.920
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal

02:14.920 --> 02:19.160
construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.560
In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating

02:23.560 --> 02:27.000
bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.760
And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I

02:30.760 --> 02:31.960
want to be balanced.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.440
So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who

02:36.440 --> 02:39.360
used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.420
And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences

02:43.420 --> 02:47.920
with men, and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and

02:47.920 --> 02:52.160
men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.720
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at

02:55.720 --> 02:59.160
first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.120
It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.440
And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone

03:06.440 --> 03:07.440
would feel that way.

03:07.440 --> 03:11.240
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.480
And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with

03:15.480 --> 03:19.800
gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue

03:19.800 --> 03:22.720
conversation, debate, idea, marketplace, expression, discourse.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.280
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner radfem.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.040
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of Jermaine Greer,

03:30.040 --> 03:35.560
and when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling ex-extra biological,

03:35.560 --> 03:38.320
and when the full moon shines, she speaks.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.600
Ugh, this is agony.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.600
I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.200
Can you imagine?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Ugh.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.920
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure

03:51.920 --> 03:56.680
she doesn't hate trans people, she just has a fewâ€¦ concerns.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.720
You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore, or you're accused

03:59.720 --> 04:00.720
of transphobia.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.320
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we, the public, never

04:05.320 --> 04:07.000
got a chance to debate.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.480
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are, allowing biological males to

04:11.480 --> 04:16.080
run rampant in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our

04:16.080 --> 04:20.680
children with the ludicrous dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.720
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.000
She goes on like that for hours, it's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator

04:27.000 --> 04:28.680
shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.680
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

04:30.680 --> 04:33.880
Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?

04:33.880 --> 04:35.440
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.760
Scholars remain divided.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.040
It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.480
You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face

04:43.480 --> 04:48.280
consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.720
It's PC run AMOC.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.040
It's a Hanukkat-astrophe.

04:52.040 --> 04:56.200
Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of

04:56.200 --> 04:57.360
untreated sewage.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.720
We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure, we

05:00.720 --> 05:04.720
have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates of family

05:04.720 --> 05:08.160
rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.520
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.120
unambiguous slogans.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.640
Trans women are women!

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
Which is true.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
We are women.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.640
But!

05:18.640 --> 05:19.640
Ooh, that was a sinister but.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.640
Watch out for that.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.800
What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most

05:23.800 --> 05:27.440
people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.880
And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not transfeminism,

05:31.880 --> 05:33.200
might wonder things like,

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
How can you be a woman without the oppression experiences of girlhood?

05:36.200 --> 05:41.840
Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

05:41.840 --> 05:47.400
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

05:47.400 --> 05:50.520
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time they're

05:50.520 --> 05:52.440
just brandished as weapons against us.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.840
You know, it's like when a man asks,

05:53.840 --> 05:59.520
If society is so sexist against women, then why is it that men are 97% of combat fatalities,

05:59.520 --> 06:00.520
feminazis?

06:00.520 --> 06:04.280
Like you could sit there for three hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,

06:04.280 --> 06:07.700
but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

06:07.700 --> 06:11.840
Because nine times out of ten, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's

06:11.840 --> 06:14.600
just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.520
And the same goes for people telling me,

06:16.520 --> 06:21.160
You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a woman?

06:21.160 --> 06:23.200
Could you define womanhood for me?

06:23.200 --> 06:26.640
Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.760
But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,

06:30.760 --> 06:35.140
and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.

06:35.140 --> 06:39.040
Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.400
In this video I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with

06:43.400 --> 06:47.880
gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers

06:47.880 --> 06:49.600
rather than dogmatic ones.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.160
Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,

06:54.320 --> 06:59.120
and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly, so if I do fuck

06:59.120 --> 07:04.000
something up, well, just read me to filth on Twitter like you always do you little shits.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.040
Love you!

07:05.040 --> 07:07.600
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.760
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

07:11.760 --> 07:14.640
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today,

07:14.640 --> 07:17.520
only the catch is that some of them are actually men.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.800
Oops, wrong channel.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.280
Concern 1. Gender Metaphysics

07:23.280 --> 07:26.640
There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.800
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.520
Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.800
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.640
Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to

07:38.640 --> 07:42.560
put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.

07:42.560 --> 07:47.200
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?

07:47.200 --> 07:50.480
I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.

07:50.480 --> 07:55.120
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.800
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between

08:00.800 --> 08:03.920
binary transgender identity and cross-sex brain anatomy,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.760
but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female brains in male bodies

08:07.760 --> 08:08.720
or anything like that.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.400
Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like

08:12.400 --> 08:16.640
gray and white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies,

08:16.640 --> 08:20.160
distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.360
So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.

08:23.360 --> 08:28.160
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,

08:28.160 --> 08:30.880
in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man,

08:30.880 --> 08:32.640
rather than as always having been a woman.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.400
But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.960
I am not real and not valid.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.760
But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening

08:43.760 --> 08:47.040
whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.600
My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.360
I always thought I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man,

08:53.360 --> 08:54.320
it doesn't matter to me.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.000
Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.840
is going around being a woman, as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.000
Concern 2. Gender Stereotypes

09:06.000 --> 09:07.840
What do you mean you live as a woman?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.440
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.200
and a fake girly voice?

09:13.200 --> 09:18.000
Listen sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.560
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.

09:22.560 --> 09:26.000
No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.600
rather we're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers

09:29.600 --> 09:32.240
to prompt others to see us for what we are.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.440
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand

09:35.440 --> 09:38.400
why I'm presenting in such a meticulously feminine way,

09:38.400 --> 09:42.880
like they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game,

09:42.880 --> 09:47.200
which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.760
so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall

09:49.760 --> 09:52.560
in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

09:52.560 --> 09:57.520
I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,

09:57.520 --> 10:00.640
because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all,

10:00.640 --> 10:03.680
and they've had to struggle since childhood against a society

10:03.680 --> 10:05.680
that's told them they have to be feminine.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.600
And I completely sympathize with that,

10:07.600 --> 10:11.440
I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.720
But also, I've had to fight against the same society

10:14.720 --> 10:18.480
that told me I should really, really, really not be this.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.240
So, I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.080
Concern three, abolish gender.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.240
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,

10:30.240 --> 10:31.600
not conforming to them.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.520
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.880
Abolish gender?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.160
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual,

10:40.160 --> 10:42.320
but, I mean, I'll give it a try.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.720
Solanus, be praised!

10:44.720 --> 10:49.360
No nails, no makeup, I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.240
I did it everyone, I abolished gender!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.720
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.720
so I should probably get rid of that.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.360
How is she though?

10:59.360 --> 11:01.680
She's feeling a little genderless.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.920
I guess the way I position my body is still gendered,

11:03.920 --> 11:06.160
and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.880
So what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly

11:08.880 --> 11:10.960
and speak in a genderless robot voice.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.400
My name is five four six six four one seven,

11:14.400 --> 11:17.440
I have no gender, patriarchy is over.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.480
I guess English is still patriarchal language, right,

11:20.480 --> 11:23.680
so I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.000
Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.280
I can't stand this, fuck this.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.920
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea,

11:29.920 --> 11:32.640
like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth

11:32.640 --> 11:34.800
didn't determine what kind of life you could live?

11:34.800 --> 11:38.480
But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.080
kind of like abolish borders.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.560
Your utopian pipe dream is valid.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.800
And denying trans people their gender identity

11:44.800 --> 11:47.120
because abolish gender is kind of like

11:47.120 --> 11:50.320
denying citizenship to immigrants because abolish borders.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.880
Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable

11:52.880 --> 11:54.240
under the present system,

11:54.240 --> 11:56.400
and then leveraging that system against them

11:56.400 --> 11:58.080
under the pretense of abolishing it.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.840
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists

11:59.840 --> 12:02.080
in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,

12:02.080 --> 12:04.960
why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

12:04.960 --> 12:06.320
You should be abolishing gender,

12:06.320 --> 12:09.040
not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.520
No, they don't attack the gender expression of people

12:11.520 --> 12:12.880
with power and influence.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.880
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.120
newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,

12:17.120 --> 12:18.640
and calling her a creepy man,

12:18.640 --> 12:20.720
and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,

12:20.720 --> 12:23.680
or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.000
It's almost like when they say abolish gender,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.640
what they really mean is abolish trans people.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.880
It's almost like this is a hate movement

12:30.880 --> 12:33.760
hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.080
But surely, I must be missing something.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.600
Concern four, male privilege.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.360
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement

12:43.360 --> 12:45.920
that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself

12:45.920 --> 12:48.480
without living any of the struggle that entails.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.000
So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.280
In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.880
I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.560
So I don't like to complain about every little

13:00.560 --> 13:01.920
microaggression I experience,

13:01.920 --> 13:03.760
because under the circumstances,

13:04.560 --> 13:06.400
it just seems a little gauche.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.920
And I don't like things that are gauche.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.880
But I've had cis-feminists of my race and class

13:10.880 --> 13:12.880
tell me that I have no idea what it's like

13:12.880 --> 13:14.880
to be talked over and interrupted by men.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.040
Actually, Kropotkin.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.880
Or to experience street harassment,

13:18.880 --> 13:20.400
or to have to treat every first date

13:20.400 --> 13:22.720
like a potentially life-threatening situation,

13:22.720 --> 13:25.760
and it's just bizarre to me that they think that.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.160
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.160
You think men treat me as their equal?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.000
You think street harassers are gonna treat me

13:32.000 --> 13:34.960
with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?

13:34.960 --> 13:35.920
Hey, beautiful.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.200
Where you going, baby?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.080
Where you going?

13:38.080 --> 13:39.280
Oh, it's tranny.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.120
Excuse me, sir, my mistake.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.520
Please, proceed freely to your destination.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.360
Come on, people.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.320
Use your heads.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.880
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,

13:48.880 --> 13:50.080
what do you think the guy in the steps

13:50.080 --> 13:51.520
of the liquor store is gonna say?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.040
When a trans woman doesn't pass,

13:53.040 --> 13:55.840
it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.920
No, you get treated as monster gender,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.600
pronouns it and spit,

13:59.600 --> 14:01.600
and male privilege is not a good description

14:01.600 --> 14:03.120
of that experience at all.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.560
Once you start passing as a woman,

14:04.560 --> 14:07.760
it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,

14:07.760 --> 14:11.120
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.440
Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical

14:13.440 --> 14:14.960
of the whole notion of passing.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.880
They think they can always clock a tran,

14:16.880 --> 14:18.800
and they assume everyone else can too.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.800
But that's just not reality.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.360
I mean, I'm only a year and a half into my transition,

14:23.360 --> 14:25.440
and at this point I've had zero surgeries,

14:25.440 --> 14:27.200
and it's been like six months

14:27.200 --> 14:29.120
since I was last misgendered offline.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.640
I mean, a person with a good eye for it

14:30.640 --> 14:31.920
will probably clock me,

14:31.920 --> 14:34.480
and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated

14:34.480 --> 14:36.400
into politically correct gender ideology,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.960
but like, you really think the gas station attendant

14:38.960 --> 14:41.520
and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

14:41.520 --> 14:45.520
are all calling me miss and ma'am because of postmodernism?

14:45.520 --> 14:46.880
I know some of you are gonna sneak off

14:46.880 --> 14:48.560
to your shitty little radfem forums

14:48.560 --> 14:51.040
and obsess over how manly and clockable I am,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.560
but like, at the end of the day,

14:52.560 --> 14:53.600
what am I gonna trust?

14:53.600 --> 14:56.400
The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,

14:56.400 --> 14:59.680
or every social interaction I've had for months.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.160
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.400
I'm ahi tuna, and you're a mackerel sweaty.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.760
Take a fucking sip, babes.

15:05.760 --> 15:11.680
I love that.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.160
Concern five, male socialization.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.520
So you had a male upbringing,

15:15.520 --> 15:17.680
you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,

15:17.680 --> 15:19.760
you benefited from male privilege for decades,

15:19.760 --> 15:21.360
and now you think none of that matters?

15:21.360 --> 15:23.680
You are who you are because of how you were socialized,

15:23.680 --> 15:25.280
not because of how you dress.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.520
All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.880
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.960
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled

15:34.960 --> 15:35.920
as a nine-year-old girl,

15:35.920 --> 15:37.600
or what that does to a child's psyche.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.200
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me

15:39.200 --> 15:40.160
until I was an adult,

15:40.160 --> 15:42.400
when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.720
That's very different from what cis women go through.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.960
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common

15:46.960 --> 15:49.040
with a typical man than a typical woman,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
and many of my experiences from those days

15:51.040 --> 15:54.240
I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.560
I absolutely benefited from male privilege,

15:56.560 --> 15:58.320
and it did influence who I was,

15:58.320 --> 16:00.800
and who I was in my late teens and early twenties

16:00.800 --> 16:02.400
was an anti-feminist shithead

16:02.400 --> 16:04.240
who had no idea what women go through.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.400
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,

16:06.400 --> 16:07.680
because in trans discourse,

16:07.680 --> 16:10.400
it's just accepted as obvious that trans men

16:10.400 --> 16:12.240
know what it's like to be raised as women,

16:12.240 --> 16:15.040
and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.880
But when it comes to the early life experiences

16:16.880 --> 16:18.640
of trans women, we're supposed to say,

16:18.640 --> 16:19.760
when I was five years old,

16:19.760 --> 16:21.360
I loved wearing my mom's high heels,

16:21.360 --> 16:23.040
or else say nothing at all.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.440
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
where she describes the way living as a woman

16:27.440 --> 16:29.280
stifles an adventurous spirit,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.520
and her longing for a male experience.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.920
Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,

16:35.920 --> 16:37.600
sailors and soldiers,

16:37.600 --> 16:38.960
barroom regulars,

16:38.960 --> 16:40.720
to be part of a scene,

16:40.720 --> 16:43.280
anonymous, listening, recording.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.160
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,

16:48.160 --> 16:49.120
a female,

16:49.120 --> 16:52.400
always supposedly in danger of assault and battery.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.920
My consuming interest in men and their lives

16:55.920 --> 16:59.840
is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,

16:59.840 --> 17:02.480
or as an invitation to intimacy.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.800
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.520
I want to be able to sleep in an open field,

17:09.520 --> 17:10.960
to travel West,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.560
to walk freely at night.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.680
So I got to do all that in my early 20s,

17:15.680 --> 17:17.200
and what I discovered is,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.880
I hate sleeping in open fields,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.400
I despise the West,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.640
and I'd really rather stay inside,

17:22.640 --> 17:24.640
collecting ceramics and sucking dick.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.240
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman,

17:26.240 --> 17:28.320
and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man

17:28.320 --> 17:30.880
because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews

17:30.880 --> 17:32.800
for reasons that are inconceivable to me.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.600
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-20s,

17:35.600 --> 17:37.920
I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,

17:37.920 --> 17:39.520
body, and sexual persona

17:39.520 --> 17:41.200
that were drastically wrong for me,

17:41.200 --> 17:43.760
and I tried every possible alternative to transitioning

17:43.760 --> 17:46.080
before realizing that I had an irrepressible need

17:46.080 --> 17:47.120
to become a woman.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.480
So I changed,

17:48.480 --> 17:49.680
and when I changed,

17:49.680 --> 17:51.440
society's treatment of me changed.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.600
Socialization doesn't end with childhood,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.120
it's a lifelong process.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.960
For example, when I transitioned,

17:56.960 --> 17:59.680
my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,

17:59.680 --> 18:01.360
and radical feminist haters

18:01.360 --> 18:03.440
started commenting on my physical appearance

18:03.440 --> 18:05.600
about 20 to 30 times more often,

18:05.600 --> 18:07.280
and I had to get used to that being something

18:07.280 --> 18:08.560
that matters a lot more.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.200
That said, resocialization takes time,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.920
and sometimes trans people who are early in transition

18:13.920 --> 18:15.680
have most of that process ahead of them.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.360
I also think we have to take into account

18:17.360 --> 18:19.520
the age at which a person transitions.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.360
Kim Petras, whomst we stan,

18:22.240 --> 18:22.800
we stan,

18:23.440 --> 18:24.080
I stan,

18:24.080 --> 18:25.200
oh we stan!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.560
She transitioned as a child,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.480
and I imagine was socialized more or less

18:28.480 --> 18:29.680
the same as a cis woman.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.760
Whereas Caitlyn Jenner, whomst,

18:31.760 --> 18:32.260
well,

18:33.840 --> 18:34.560
just whomst.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.480
She made millions of dollars in men's sports,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.400
she had six children by three wives,

18:38.400 --> 18:40.880
she transitioned in retirement at age 65,

18:40.880 --> 18:43.520
and told BuzzFeed that the hardest part of being a woman

18:43.520 --> 18:45.120
is figuring out what to wear.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.960
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.000
It makes me want to cry.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.160
I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,

18:52.160 --> 18:54.080
but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue

18:54.080 --> 18:56.400
that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective

18:56.400 --> 18:57.920
doesn't have a leg to stand on.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.960
But also, trans women often don't experience

19:00.960 --> 19:03.120
male socialization the way cis men do.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.960
Many trans women are feminine and queer

19:04.960 --> 19:06.080
before they transition,

19:06.080 --> 19:08.400
and have always experienced a kind of fem-phobia

19:08.400 --> 19:09.760
that is rooted in misogyny.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.680
Some trans women also identified as women

19:11.680 --> 19:13.120
years before transitioning,

19:13.120 --> 19:15.760
and internalized society's messaging about women

19:15.760 --> 19:17.840
more than society's messaging about men.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.920
Now that's still not the same as living in society

19:19.920 --> 19:21.280
as a girl from birth,

19:21.280 --> 19:23.680
but it's also pretty different from the socialization

19:23.680 --> 19:24.880
of most cis men.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.120
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue

19:27.120 --> 19:29.760
that trans women never experience male privilege

19:29.760 --> 19:32.160
is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege

19:32.160 --> 19:33.840
as a proxy for calling us men.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.520
Pull up your zipper.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.000
Your male privilege is hanging out.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.640
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point

19:40.640 --> 19:42.480
for many gender-critical feminists

19:42.480 --> 19:45.040
is that there's an element here of stolen valor,

19:45.040 --> 19:47.440
this sense of injustice that people are claiming

19:47.440 --> 19:50.000
their identity without experiencing their oppression.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.080
It reminds me of what in the trans community

19:52.080 --> 19:54.080
are called transmedicalists,

19:54.080 --> 19:56.400
people who insist the only real trans people

19:56.400 --> 19:58.720
are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.360
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing

20:01.360 --> 20:03.920
that confirms your identity is pain.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.800
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.000
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.520
You don't know what it's like.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.520
You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying

20:15.520 --> 20:18.240
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity

20:18.240 --> 20:20.240
so stigmatized that most of the people

20:20.240 --> 20:21.840
who are attracted to you in private

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
are too ashamed to admit it in public.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.280
You don't know what it's like to have a body

20:25.280 --> 20:27.040
so non-normative that you're shut out

20:27.040 --> 20:28.560
of whole areas of society.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.920
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest

20:31.920 --> 20:33.680
does nothing but to provoke infighting

20:33.680 --> 20:35.520
between trans women and cis women

20:35.520 --> 20:37.840
at a time when we should be marching side by side

20:37.840 --> 20:39.680
to destroy video games forever.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.120
Hashtag yes all gamers.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.640
What, what, what?

20:42.640 --> 20:45.360
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.960
You don't know what it's like to grow up

20:46.960 --> 20:50.000
being shamed for your periods, to fear unwanted pregnancy,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
to have to fight for your right to abortion,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.320
to bear the pain of childbirth.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.360
Well, yeah, that's true.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.800
My inner Radfem sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.720
I do think it's important for trans women

21:02.720 --> 21:04.480
to stand in solidarity with cis women

21:04.480 --> 21:06.960
on issues like period equity and abortion rights,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.880
and to learn about the experiences of cis women

21:08.880 --> 21:10.480
to form a more complete understanding

21:10.480 --> 21:11.680
of the female condition.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.160
But of course no individual woman experiences

21:14.160 --> 21:15.920
all the things women experience,

21:15.920 --> 21:18.560
and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood

21:18.560 --> 21:20.000
in drastically different ways.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.480
For some women, having babies is the most essentially

21:22.480 --> 21:23.680
womanly experience.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.000
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.920
I mean, not actually, but you know,

21:27.920 --> 21:29.840
TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.320
For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails

21:32.320 --> 21:34.320
in my business inbox from married men

21:34.320 --> 21:36.000
struggling through the existential crisis

21:36.000 --> 21:39.040
of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.400
Also, do you want to be a guest

21:40.400 --> 21:42.560
on my podcast Free Speech Radio?

21:42.560 --> 21:45.200
But also, not all women experience their womanhood

21:45.200 --> 21:46.480
as essentially oppressive,

21:46.480 --> 21:48.880
or centered around the pain of reproductive capacity.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.280
When Shania Twain sang Man, I Feel Like a Woman,

21:51.280 --> 21:53.680
she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion

21:53.680 --> 21:56.320
in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.800
Man, I feel like shit.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.280
["I Feel Like a Woman"]

22:01.280 --> 22:04.400
Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.880
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary

22:06.880 --> 22:09.280
needed to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.920
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people

22:11.920 --> 22:15.360
and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.560
Well, I, for one, am not a menstruator.

22:18.560 --> 22:23.440
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.720
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator

22:26.720 --> 22:28.640
or pregnant people and are thinking,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.800
what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak

22:30.800 --> 22:32.480
gender cuckoldry is that?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.680
Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.600
Some medical organizations have recently begun

22:37.600 --> 22:40.480
using the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.200
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word

22:43.200 --> 22:46.240
menstruators in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.920
This has prompted some conservative,

22:47.920 --> 22:49.760
TERF, and Christian publications

22:49.760 --> 22:51.680
to post panicked commentaries warning

22:51.680 --> 22:54.240
that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.640
But in fact, medical language that assumes

22:56.640 --> 22:58.560
that everyone with a uterus is a woman

22:58.560 --> 23:00.880
erases trans men, or non-binary people

23:00.880 --> 23:02.480
who menstruate and get pregnant.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.520
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,

23:05.520 --> 23:07.760
whereas saying pregnant people includes them

23:07.760 --> 23:10.000
and cis women and doesn't erase anyone,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.520
except for Cincinnatians,

23:11.520 --> 23:13.440
because we all know they're not people.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.960
Take your shitty chili elsewhere.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.200
But I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.120
What kind of misogynistic madness is it

23:19.120 --> 23:21.520
to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

23:21.520 --> 23:23.760
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator

23:23.760 --> 23:25.440
sounds pretty dehumanizing,

23:25.440 --> 23:27.200
and the trans men I've talked to about this

23:27.200 --> 23:28.720
aren't the biggest fans of it either.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.240
Sometimes it takes a while to settle

23:30.240 --> 23:33.040
on language that's both inclusive and usable,

23:33.040 --> 23:35.360
and my prediction is that menstruators

23:35.360 --> 23:36.640
is not gonna work out.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.320
Maybe people who menstruate?

23:38.320 --> 23:40.000
But why can't I just say woman?

23:40.000 --> 23:40.800
That's what I am.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.840
You can't just say woman.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.360
That is what you are.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.360
No one is asking that you stop referring

23:47.360 --> 23:48.720
to yourself as a woman.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.800
Institutional medical language is designed

23:50.800 --> 23:53.120
to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.040
No one is proposing that we stop calling

23:55.040 --> 23:58.080
individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.040
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.000
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.680
I notice you're not suggesting doctors

24:05.680 --> 24:07.840
start saying people with prostates.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.240
Though I am definitely suggesting that.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.040
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces

24:13.040 --> 24:15.520
and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.320
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing

24:18.320 --> 24:20.800
or celebrating periods or wearing pussy hats

24:20.800 --> 24:23.200
at political marches or free-bleeding

24:23.200 --> 24:24.320
all over the National Mall.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.520
I mean, someone has to.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.080
The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.720
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate

24:30.720 --> 24:33.760
their reproductive anatomy in defiance of a society

24:33.760 --> 24:36.240
that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.560
The problem arises only when menstruation

24:38.560 --> 24:41.360
or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men

24:41.360 --> 24:43.760
or exclude wombs whom stoth not bleed.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.360
I mean, trans women do bleed,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.600
but only when we cut ourselves.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.880
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.000
Concern eight, TERF is a slur.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.040
TERF is a slur designed to silence women.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.800
Nay, it is hate speech designed

25:02.800 --> 25:04.720
to incite violence against women.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.960
The word TERF is a pejorative for a person

25:06.960 --> 25:09.600
who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,

25:09.600 --> 25:11.040
but it's not a slur.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.760
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race,

25:13.760 --> 25:15.680
religion, gender, or sexuality.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.680
The word misogynist is pejorative,

25:17.680 --> 25:19.520
it has only negative connotations,

25:19.520 --> 25:22.400
and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.480
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs,

25:24.480 --> 25:25.840
not a type of person.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.680
The same is true of the word TERF.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.480
It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors

25:30.480 --> 25:32.400
that deserve to be derogated.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.280
The term gender-critical is really a euphemism

25:35.280 --> 25:37.280
recently created to replace TERF

25:37.280 --> 25:40.160
with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.040
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race-realist,

25:43.040 --> 25:45.680
which was invented by racists wanting a more flattering

25:45.680 --> 25:47.920
and respectable description of their beliefs.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.320
I've used the term gender-critical in this video

25:50.320 --> 25:52.240
to be inviting to fence-sitters,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.480
but I refuse to cooperate with racists

25:54.480 --> 25:56.320
who want me to use their euphemisms,

25:56.320 --> 25:58.880
and I generally do the same with TERFs.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.000
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.280
I usually like to call people

26:03.280 --> 26:04.800
by whatever they want to be called.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.440
But when it comes to race-realist or gender-critical,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.520
every time I use these phrases,

26:09.520 --> 26:11.520
I'm essentially becoming an accomplice

26:11.520 --> 26:13.680
in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.920
And I have especially little patience

26:15.920 --> 26:18.720
for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,

26:18.720 --> 26:20.880
since most of the language used by TERFs

26:20.880 --> 26:24.240
is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,

26:24.240 --> 26:26.560
harmful, and insulting to trans people.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.200
For instance, TERFs refer to any and all

26:29.200 --> 26:31.840
trans-related surgery as mutilation.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.680
They call trans women TIMs,

26:33.680 --> 26:36.240
an acronym for trans-identified males,

26:36.240 --> 26:39.760
and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,

26:39.760 --> 26:42.800
obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.360
Just to give you a sample of typical TERF prose,

26:45.360 --> 26:46.640
here are a couple comments

26:46.640 --> 26:48.400
from literally the first thread I saw

26:48.400 --> 26:49.920
on the gender-critical subreddit

26:49.920 --> 26:51.520
while I was working on this video.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.480
And I have to admit to considerably more contempt

26:54.480 --> 26:56.080
for the likes of ****,

26:56.080 --> 27:00.400
since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,

27:00.400 --> 27:02.640
insulting to women facial expressions.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.960
I also get a good laugh

27:04.960 --> 27:07.760
at TIMs putting their hands up to their shins.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.680
They're trying to look all dainty

27:09.680 --> 27:11.520
and to hide their Adam's apple,

27:11.520 --> 27:13.440
but it only draws more attention

27:13.440 --> 27:15.920
to their enormous man hands.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.280
I saw an AGP photo shoot with this Neanderthal

27:19.280 --> 27:23.280
in his 50s was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,

27:23.280 --> 27:25.280
his hands dainty at his ear.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.760
In every photo, even group ones at events.

27:30.480 --> 27:34.080
Now I was just grossed out.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.120
So there it is.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.640
That's what this is really about.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.080
In this video, I've gone through a list

27:38.080 --> 27:39.760
of gender-critical concerns,

27:39.760 --> 27:41.120
and I've provided responses

27:41.120 --> 27:42.960
I hope the average person will find fair.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.040
But I would be lying to you by omission

27:45.040 --> 27:46.240
if I were to end this video

27:46.240 --> 27:47.680
without being real with you

27:47.680 --> 27:50.400
about what the core of the gender-critical movement

27:50.400 --> 27:52.000
is actually about.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.520
See, what TERFs do in public

27:53.520 --> 27:55.360
is advance what, on the surface,

27:55.360 --> 27:57.920
are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.960
For example, the critique

27:58.960 --> 28:00.400
that hyperfeminine trans women

28:00.400 --> 28:02.560
are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes

28:02.560 --> 28:03.920
designed to oppress women.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.920
At a glance, this appears to be a critique

28:05.920 --> 28:08.640
of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.840
But in the next breath,

28:09.840 --> 28:11.120
these same TERFs will argue

28:11.120 --> 28:13.680
that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts

28:13.680 --> 28:16.480
who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.720
So if trans women being feminine is bad,

28:18.720 --> 28:20.960
and trans women being masculine is bad,

28:20.960 --> 28:22.400
then there really is no way

28:22.400 --> 28:25.280
that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.440
So in fact, what TERFs really oppose

28:27.440 --> 28:29.200
is not trans women being feminine

28:29.200 --> 28:31.040
or trans women being masculine,

28:31.040 --> 28:33.760
but trans women being trans women.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.600
In other words, the fundamental issue

28:35.600 --> 28:38.000
underlying all these phony concerns

28:38.000 --> 28:40.720
is transphobia, simple animosity

28:40.720 --> 28:42.960
towards trans people's very existence.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.120
And it's pretty easy to recognize that

28:45.120 --> 28:47.600
just from the tone they use when they talk about us.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.520
When you read through the gender-critical subreddit

28:49.520 --> 28:51.600
or TERF Twitter, which you see

28:51.600 --> 28:54.720
is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes

28:54.720 --> 28:57.120
draped over a jagged thorn-tangle

28:57.120 --> 28:59.600
of visceral disgust and targeted hate.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.000
The pure exuberant malice of it all

29:02.000 --> 29:04.560
is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote

29:04.560 --> 29:06.000
from the opening of this video

29:06.000 --> 29:08.400
or in the average gender-critical forum post.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.000
The enormous, snuckly, hairy, beringed paw.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.480
The pancake makeup through which the stubble

29:14.480 --> 29:15.840
was already burgeoning.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.160
This Neanderthal in his 50s.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.520
Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.760
Now I was just grossed out.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.640
What gender-critical feminism really amounts to

29:26.640 --> 29:29.600
is a Baroque palace of rationalizations

29:29.600 --> 29:33.040
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.600
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.360
You know, I came of age when gay marriage

29:37.360 --> 29:39.200
was the most contentious social debate,

29:39.200 --> 29:40.800
and the arguments people made

29:40.800 --> 29:42.240
that marriage was under attack,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.000
that the children would be traumatized,

29:44.080 --> 29:45.920
that bestiality would be next,

29:45.920 --> 29:47.840
that this tiny minority was undermining

29:47.840 --> 29:50.160
all our institutions with their outrageous demands,

29:50.160 --> 29:52.400
it was all just nonsense.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.000
If you got a conservative drunk,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.760
as I used to be able to do,

29:55.760 --> 29:57.920
Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,

29:57.920 --> 29:59.520
he would just blurt out the truth,

29:59.520 --> 30:01.920
which was that the sight of two grown men

30:01.920 --> 30:04.400
locking lips made him wanna bomb.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.000
Homophobia and transphobia

30:06.000 --> 30:08.400
do not originate in the frontal cortex.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.960
They come from the lizard brain disgust response

30:10.960 --> 30:12.560
we evolved to deal with blood,

30:12.640 --> 30:15.200
infection, vomit, feces, flies,

30:15.200 --> 30:17.760
the hairy paw, the stubble burgeoning

30:17.760 --> 30:18.960
through the pancake makeup.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.720
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,

30:22.720 --> 30:24.240
because it's the same disgust

30:24.240 --> 30:26.800
I felt toward myself for years.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.520
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman

30:29.520 --> 30:32.320
on the L platform in Chicago five years ago

30:32.320 --> 30:33.600
and decided then and there

30:33.600 --> 30:36.080
to abandon my first attempt at transition.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.440
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.040
It's the disgust that's always

30:41.040 --> 30:42.720
at the bottom of transphobia,

30:42.720 --> 30:45.600
because transphobia is always the same.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.520
It always comes from the same place,

30:47.520 --> 30:50.320
and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.880
I recently rewatched that classic viral video

30:52.880 --> 30:54.560
from an old episode of Cops

30:54.560 --> 30:56.320
where a police officer humiliates

30:56.320 --> 30:59.200
a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.840
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID,

31:01.840 --> 31:03.760
misgenders her, deadnames her,

31:03.760 --> 31:05.120
mocks her clothes and makeup,

31:05.120 --> 31:06.720
and calls her a crossdresser.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.880
It's all so repetitive and familiar.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.360
It's the same arsenal of petty sadism

31:11.360 --> 31:12.880
you see in the right-wing press,

31:12.880 --> 31:15.200
on 4chan, on doxing forums,

31:15.200 --> 31:16.720
on gender-critical Reddit.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.160
It's all the same.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.640
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair

31:20.640 --> 31:22.640
is her unbreakable wit and confidence

31:22.640 --> 31:24.480
in the face of transphobic abuse.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.800
The single most iconic moment is when,

31:26.800 --> 31:28.720
after being grilled in the back of the cop car

31:28.720 --> 31:31.200
amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,

31:31.200 --> 31:33.360
she glances back at the cop and says,

31:33.360 --> 31:35.120
Excuse my beauty.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.080
Excuse your beauty.

31:36.080 --> 31:36.720
Okay.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.400
And that, right there,

31:38.400 --> 31:42.000
is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
the resilience of trans women,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.400
the assumption of a regal posture,

31:46.400 --> 31:48.800
and even the most abject conditions.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.880
And that's really all you can do,

31:50.880 --> 31:52.480
because there's just no reasoning

31:52.480 --> 31:54.160
a transphobe out of bigotry.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.960
So, to any diehard gender-critical feminists

31:56.960 --> 31:58.240
still watching this,

31:58.240 --> 32:00.160
what else can I say except,

32:00.160 --> 32:01.920
on behalf of all trans women,

32:01.920 --> 32:03.040
excuse my beauty.

32:03.760 --> 32:04.560
Turf.

32:04.640 --> 32:05.440
Turf.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.320
Turf.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.280
Turf.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.080
Turf.

32:34.560 --> 32:50.240
I posted an invitation to Twitter for people who used to be gender-critical feminists

32:50.240 --> 32:54.640
to chew me in the back of the head.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.640
It's PC Ron Amac.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.640
It's PC Ron Amac.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.640
Look at him.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.640
It's so stupid.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.640
It's so stupid.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.640
It's PC Ron Amac.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.640
Corona Premiere.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
Turf beer of choice.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.640
My chromosomes need to unwind after a hard day of hating trans people.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.640
It is absurd.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.640
These titties.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.640
I just saw them and I just lost it.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
I just.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.640
It's just.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.640
What?

33:24.640 --> 33:26.640
What?

33:26.640 --> 33:28.640
I am a W-M-B-Y-N.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.640
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.640
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.640
No one knows what it's like

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
to be a sad trans.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.640
To be a trash can

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
for trap chasers.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640
For trap chasers.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.640
Perfect.
