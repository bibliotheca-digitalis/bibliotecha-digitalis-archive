0	7800	On the day that the female eunuch was issued in America, a person in flapping draperies
7800	10240	rushed up to me and grabbed my hand.
10240	13280	Thank you, it breathed hoarsely.
13280	16640	Thank you so much for all you've done for us, girls.
16640	22680	I smirked and nodded and stepped backward, trying to extricate my hand from the enormous
22680	27160	knackery, hairy, baringered paw that clutched it.
27160	32360	The face staring into mine was thickly coated with a pancake make-up through which the stubble
32360	39680	was already burgeoning in futile competition with a dinel wig of immense luxury and two
39680	42880	pairs of false eyelashes.
42880	48680	Against the bony ribs that could be counted through its flimsy scarf-dress swung a polished
48680	51600	steel woman's liberation emblem.
51600	54560	I should have said, you're a man.
54560	58360	The female eunuch has done less than nothing for you.
58360	60360	Poof!
67080	69240	Let's go, adult human females.
69240	77360	ðŸŽµ
77360	82400	First of all, a reminder that this video is a female-only space, so if there are any men
82400	85040	here today, get out.
85040	89600	I mean, unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own, in
89600	92280	which case like, comment, subscribe.
92280	97280	So look, it's 2019 and I think most people have heard about TERFs, trans-exclusionary
97280	98280	radical feminists.
98280	102480	You know, these fanatics like Germaine Greer who call trans women it and think trans men
102480	106400	are lost lesbian sisters.
106400	108760	You guys do know about trans men, right?
108760	111280	Male-to-female is not the only type of transgender person.
111280	116160	There's also people who were born, well, people who were assigned.
116160	119080	People who were always.
119080	121480	People who identify.
121480	124920	TERFs don't like being called TERFs, they think it's a term of disparagement, which
124920	125920	it is.
125920	130040	They call themselves radical feminists, radfems, or lately, gender critical.
130040	134920	The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity, gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal
134920	139160	construct and biological sex is the only thing that makes a person a man or a woman.
139160	143560	In the past on this channel, I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry, man-hating
143560	147000	bigots whose only real tactic is accusing trans women of being creepy men.
147000	150760	And there definitely are some people who are really like that, but I want to be fair, I
150760	151960	want to be balanced.
151960	156440	So in preparation to make this video, I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people who
156440	159360	used to be gender critical feminists to share their stories with me.
159360	163420	And I got hundreds of responses, a lot of them from women who've had traumatic experiences
163420	167920	with men, and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender where women and
167920	172160	men are completely separate species, where women are safe and men are dangerous.
172160	175720	And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people into their picture of the world at
175720	179160	first challenged their sense of stability and comfort.
179160	183120	It was difficult emotional work, work they needed to do, but still difficult.
183120	186440	And that makes total sense to me, like it's very easy for me to understand why someone
186440	187440	would feel that way.
187440	191240	So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted to the gender critical worldview.
191240	195480	And in this video, I don't just want to parody TERFs, this time I want to really engage with
195480	199800	gender critical ideas in the public arena of free speech, open communication, dialogue
199800	202720	conversation, debate, idea, marketplace, expression, discourse.
202720	205280	Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner radfem.
205280	210040	She's a little shy, sure, but she's here, not queer, reads a lot of Jermaine Greer,
210040	215560	and when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty, she's feeling ex-extra biological,
215560	218320	and when the full moon shines, she speaks.
219320	221600	Ugh, this is agony.
221600	225600	I'm a biological woman trapped in the body of a male narcissist.
225600	227200	Can you imagine?
227200	228200	Ugh.
228200	231920	Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure, but she's not a bigot, you know, I'm sure
231920	236680	she doesn't hate trans people, she just has a fewâ€¦ concerns.
236680	239720	You know, it's like you're not even allowed to ask questions anymore, or you're accused
239720	240720	of transphobia.
240720	245320	We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology that we, the public, never
245320	247000	got a chance to debate.
247000	251480	We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy, yet here we are, allowing biological males to
251480	256080	run rampant in women's spaces, foisting penises on lesbians, and indoctrinating our
256080	260680	children with the ludicrous dogma that girls can become boys with a change of costume.
260680	263720	Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.
263720	267000	She goes on like that for hours, it's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator
267000	268680	shaft with the ghost of Anita Bryant.
268680	270680	Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?
270680	273880	Do you have any idea how many decades I fought for your rights?
273880	275440	Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?
275440	276760	Scholars remain divided.
277000	280040	It does seem like it's getting harder to have conversations about difficult topics.
280040	283480	You know, our children are coming of age in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face
283480	288280	consequences for simply having a politically incorrect opinion about the Jewish question.
288280	289720	It's PC run AMOC.
289720	292040	It's a Hanukkat-astrophe.
292040	296200	Problematic banter aside, the current discourse about transgender issues is an explosion of
296200	297360	untreated sewage.
297360	300720	We have far-right politicians menacing us with legal discrimination and erasure, we
300720	304720	have fear-mongering and hostility in the press, and that, combined with high rates of family
304720	308160	rejection and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.
308160	312520	So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing, and shield ourselves behind simple,
312520	314120	unambiguous slogans.
314120	315640	Trans women are women!
315640	316640	Which is true.
316640	317640	We are women.
317640	318640	But!
318640	319640	Ooh, that was a sinister but.
319640	320640	Watch out for that.
320640	323800	What happens is that people who don't really understand trans issues, in other words, most
323800	327440	people, have lots of unanswered questions about the details.
327440	331880	And in particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory, but not transfeminism,
331880	333200	might wonder things like,
333200	336200	How can you be a woman without the oppression experiences of girlhood?
336200	341840	Why can't you just be a feminine man instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?
341840	347400	Why are misogynistic gender ideologues erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?
347400	350520	Trans people don't like engaging with these questions because most of the time they're
350520	352440	just brandished as weapons against us.
352440	353840	You know, it's like when a man asks,
353840	359520	If society is so sexist against women, then why is it that men are 97% of combat fatalities,
359520	360520	feminazis?
360520	364280	Like you could sit there for three hours trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,
364280	367700	but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?
367700	371840	Because nine times out of ten, that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities, he's
371840	374600	just trolling you to shut down whatever actual point you are making.
374600	376520	And the same goes for people telling me,
376520	381160	You sure do like wearing nails and makeup, is that all you think there is to being a woman?
381160	383200	Could you define womanhood for me?
383200	386640	Like they don't actually care, they're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.
386960	390760	But if you really are sincerely wondering about the answer to these troll questions,
390760	395140	and many people are, then you actually need fairly complicated and nuanced answers.
395140	399040	Which is why they make such good troll questions, because they waste a lot of your time.
399040	403400	In this video I want to take at face value the questions and concerns associated with
403400	407880	gender-critical hostility to trans people, and I want to try to give nuanced answers
407880	409600	rather than dogmatic ones.
409600	414160	Now the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard, so I might fuck something up,
414320	419120	and a lot of trans people want me to represent them absolutely perfectly, so if I do fuck
419120	424000	something up, well, just read me to filth on Twitter like you always do you little shits.
424000	425040	Love you!
425040	427600	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
429680	431760	Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?
431760	434640	We have 13 beautiful women on our show today,
434640	437520	only the catch is that some of them are actually men.
437520	438800	Oops, wrong channel.
440720	443280	Concern 1. Gender Metaphysics
443280	446640	There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.
446640	448800	There are no pink brains and blue brains.
448800	451520	Just because you want to be a woman doesn't mean you are one.
451520	454800	This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.
454800	458640	Trans people often use metaphorical language to describe feelings that are difficult to
458640	462560	put into words, and that's how I understand the trapped in the wrong body language.
462560	467200	Is there literally such a thing as a male soul trapped in a female body or vice versa?
467200	470480	I personally don't believe there is, but I'm a little biased.
470480	475120	I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.
477360	480800	As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting a correlation between
480800	483920	binary transgender identity and cross-sex brain anatomy,
483920	487760	but the evidence really doesn't justify claims about female brains in male bodies
487760	488720	or anything like that.
488720	492400	Brain differences between men and women are statistical averages of things like
492400	496640	gray and white matter density, not, as the term female brain implies,
496640	500160	distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.
500160	503360	So I personally don't believe in any gender metaphysics at all.
503360	508160	I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person, so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,
508160	510880	in that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man,
510880	512640	rather than as always having been a woman.
512640	516400	But it's important to remember that while I may not fit the typical profile,
516400	518960	I am not real and not valid.
518960	523760	But in any case, I live as a woman now, and that's kind of just what's happening
523760	527040	whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.
527040	529600	My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.
529600	533360	I always thought I don't care how someone becomes a woman or a man,
533360	534320	it doesn't matter to me.
535040	538000	Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman,
538000	541840	is going around being a woman, as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.
543360	546000	Concern 2. Gender Stereotypes
546000	547840	What do you mean you live as a woman?
547840	551440	You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes by putting on nails, makeup,
551440	553200	and a fake girly voice?
553200	558000	Listen sweaty, first of all, my girly voice is very fucking real.
558000	562560	Second, my clothes, makeup, voice, none of this makes me a woman.
562560	566000	No trans woman thinks that femininity and womanhood are the same,
566000	569600	rather we're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers
569600	572240	to prompt others to see us for what we are.
572240	575440	Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends don't really understand
575440	578400	why I'm presenting in such a meticulously feminine way,
578400	582880	like they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11am because I'm playing some kind of clout game,
582880	587200	which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir, that's gonna ruin my day,
587200	589760	so I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall
589760	592560	in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.
592560	597520	I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,
597520	600640	because they don't identify with this vision of womanhood at all,
600640	603680	and they've had to struggle since childhood against a society
603680	605680	that's told them they have to be feminine.
605680	607600	And I completely sympathize with that,
607600	611440	I think there should be more gender freedom, less coercion, less restriction.
611440	614720	But also, I've had to fight against the same society
614720	618480	that told me I should really, really, really not be this.
618480	622240	So, I feel like we should be able to form some kind of solidarity here.
623760	626080	Concern three, abolish gender.
626080	630240	But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs of masculinity and femininity,
630240	631600	not conforming to them.
631600	635520	Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.
635520	636880	Abolish gender?
636880	640160	Well, that sounds like an ambitious project for one transsexual,
640160	642320	but, I mean, I'll give it a try.
643120	644720	Solanus, be praised!
644720	649360	No nails, no makeup, I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.
649360	652240	I did it everyone, I abolished gender!
652240	654720	Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier,
654720	656720	so I should probably get rid of that.
657840	659360	How is she though?
659360	661680	She's feeling a little genderless.
661680	663920	I guess the way I position my body is still gendered,
663920	666160	and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.
666160	668880	So what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly
668880	670960	and speak in a genderless robot voice.
670960	674400	My name is five four six six four one seven,
674400	677440	I have no gender, patriarchy is over.
678000	680480	I guess English is still patriarchal language, right,
680480	683680	so I should probably be communicating with a series of genderless sounds.
683680	686000	Neer, neer, neer, neer, neer, neer.
686000	687280	I can't stand this, fuck this.
687280	689920	Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea,
689920	692640	like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth
692640	694800	didn't determine what kind of life you could live?
694800	698480	But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,
698480	700080	kind of like abolish borders.
700080	702560	Your utopian pipe dream is valid.
702560	704800	And denying trans people their gender identity
704800	707120	because abolish gender is kind of like
707120	710320	denying citizenship to immigrants because abolish borders.
710320	712880	Like you're targeting the people who are the most vulnerable
712880	714240	under the present system,
714240	716400	and then leveraging that system against them
716400	718080	under the pretense of abolishing it.
718080	719840	You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists
719840	722080	in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments like,
722080	724960	why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?
724960	726320	You should be abolishing gender,
726320	729040	not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.
729040	731520	No, they don't attack the gender expression of people
731520	732880	with power and influence.
732880	734880	They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,
734880	737120	newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,
737120	738640	and calling her a creepy man,
738640	740720	and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,
740720	743680	or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.
743680	746000	It's almost like when they say abolish gender,
746000	748640	what they really mean is abolish trans people.
748640	750880	It's almost like this is a hate movement
750880	753760	hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.
753760	756080	But surely, I must be missing something.
756560	759600	Concern four, male privilege.
760240	763360	It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement
763360	765920	that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself
765920	768480	without living any of the struggle that entails.
768480	772000	So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.
772000	775280	In the grand scheme of things, I'm really not very oppressed.
775280	778880	I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.
778880	780560	So I don't like to complain about every little
780560	781920	microaggression I experience,
781920	783760	because under the circumstances,
784560	786400	it just seems a little gauche.
786400	787920	And I don't like things that are gauche.
788480	790880	But I've had cis-feminists of my race and class
790880	792880	tell me that I have no idea what it's like
792880	794880	to be talked over and interrupted by men.
794880	797040	Actually, Kropotkin.
797040	798880	Or to experience street harassment,
798880	800400	or to have to treat every first date
800400	802720	like a potentially life-threatening situation,
802720	805760	and it's just bizarre to me that they think that.
805760	808160	Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?
808160	810160	You think men treat me as their equal?
810160	812000	You think street harassers are gonna treat me
812000	814960	with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?
814960	815920	Hey, beautiful.
815920	817200	Where you going, baby?
817200	818080	Where you going?
818080	819280	Oh, it's tranny.
819280	821120	Excuse me, sir, my mistake.
821120	823520	Please, proceed freely to your destination.
824320	825360	Come on, people.
825360	826320	Use your heads.
826320	828880	When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,
828880	830080	what do you think the guy in the steps
830080	831520	of the liquor store is gonna say?
831520	833040	When a trans woman doesn't pass,
833040	835840	it's not like society simply treats her like a man.
835840	837920	No, you get treated as monster gender,
837920	839600	pronouns it and spit,
839600	841600	and male privilege is not a good description
841600	843120	of that experience at all.
843120	844560	Once you start passing as a woman,
844560	847760	it's really a step up, even though women get treated bad,
847760	851120	because it's still better to be a she than an it.
851120	853440	Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical
853440	854960	of the whole notion of passing.
854960	856880	They think they can always clock a tran,
856880	858800	and they assume everyone else can too.
858800	860800	But that's just not reality.
860800	863360	I mean, I'm only a year and a half into my transition,
863360	865440	and at this point I've had zero surgeries,
865440	867200	and it's been like six months
867200	869120	since I was last misgendered offline.
869200	870640	I mean, a person with a good eye for it
870640	871920	will probably clock me,
871920	874480	and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated
874480	876400	into politically correct gender ideology,
876400	878960	but like, you really think the gas station attendant
878960	881520	and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy
881520	885520	are all calling me miss and ma'am because of postmodernism?
885520	886880	I know some of you are gonna sneak off
886880	888560	to your shitty little radfem forums
888560	891040	and obsess over how manly and clockable I am,
891040	892560	but like, at the end of the day,
892560	893600	what am I gonna trust?
893600	896400	The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,
896400	899680	or every social interaction I've had for months.
899680	902160	I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.
902160	904400	I'm ahi tuna, and you're a mackerel sweaty.
904400	905760	Take a fucking sip, babes.
905760	911680	I love that.
911680	914160	Concern five, male socialization.
914160	915520	So you had a male upbringing,
915520	917680	you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,
917680	919760	you benefited from male privilege for decades,
919760	921360	and now you think none of that matters?
921360	923680	You are who you are because of how you were socialized,
923680	925280	not because of how you dress.
925280	927520	All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.
930800	932880	So on the one hand, you're partially right.
932880	934960	I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled
934960	935920	as a nine-year-old girl,
935920	937600	or what that does to a child's psyche.
937600	939200	That kind of thing didn't start happening to me
939200	940160	until I was an adult,
940160	942400	when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.
942400	944720	That's very different from what cis women go through.
944720	946960	My upbringing in adolescence has more in common
946960	949040	with a typical man than a typical woman,
949040	951040	and many of my experiences from those days
951040	954240	I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.
954240	956560	I absolutely benefited from male privilege,
956560	958320	and it did influence who I was,
958320	960800	and who I was in my late teens and early twenties
960800	962400	was an anti-feminist shithead
962400	964240	who had no idea what women go through.
964240	966400	And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,
966400	967680	because in trans discourse,
967680	970400	it's just accepted as obvious that trans men
970400	972240	know what it's like to be raised as women,
972240	975040	and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.
975040	976880	But when it comes to the early life experiences
976880	978640	of trans women, we're supposed to say,
978640	979760	when I was five years old,
979760	981360	I loved wearing my mom's high heels,
981360	983040	or else say nothing at all.
983040	985440	There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,
985440	987440	where she describes the way living as a woman
987440	989280	stifles an adventurous spirit,
989280	991520	and her longing for a male experience.
991520	995920	Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,
995920	997600	sailors and soldiers,
997600	998960	barroom regulars,
998960	1000720	to be part of a scene,
1000720	1003280	anonymous, listening, recording.
1003920	1008160	All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,
1008160	1009120	a female,
1009120	1012400	always supposedly in danger of assault and battery.
1013040	1015920	My consuming interest in men and their lives
1015920	1019840	is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,
1019840	1022480	or as an invitation to intimacy.
1022480	1026800	Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.
1026800	1029520	I want to be able to sleep in an open field,
1029520	1030960	to travel West,
1030960	1032560	to walk freely at night.
1033200	1035680	So I got to do all that in my early 20s,
1035680	1037200	and what I discovered is,
1037200	1038880	I hate sleeping in open fields,
1038880	1040400	I despise the West,
1040400	1042640	and I'd really rather stay inside,
1042640	1044640	collecting ceramics and sucking dick.
1044640	1046240	Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman,
1046240	1048320	and I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man
1048320	1050880	because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews
1050880	1052800	for reasons that are inconceivable to me.
1052800	1055600	What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-20s,
1055600	1057920	I realized that I was inhabiting a gender,
1057920	1059520	body, and sexual persona
1059520	1061200	that were drastically wrong for me,
1061200	1063760	and I tried every possible alternative to transitioning
1063760	1066080	before realizing that I had an irrepressible need
1066080	1067120	to become a woman.
1067120	1068480	So I changed,
1068480	1069680	and when I changed,
1069680	1071440	society's treatment of me changed.
1071440	1073600	Socialization doesn't end with childhood,
1073600	1075120	it's a lifelong process.
1075120	1076960	For example, when I transitioned,
1076960	1079680	my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,
1079680	1081360	and radical feminist haters
1081360	1083440	started commenting on my physical appearance
1083440	1085600	about 20 to 30 times more often,
1085600	1087280	and I had to get used to that being something
1087280	1088560	that matters a lot more.
1088560	1091200	That said, resocialization takes time,
1091200	1093920	and sometimes trans people who are early in transition
1093920	1095680	have most of that process ahead of them.
1095680	1097360	I also think we have to take into account
1097360	1099520	the age at which a person transitions.
1099520	1101360	Kim Petras, whomst we stan,
1102240	1102800	we stan,
1103440	1104080	I stan,
1104080	1105200	oh we stan!
1105200	1106560	She transitioned as a child,
1106560	1108480	and I imagine was socialized more or less
1108480	1109680	the same as a cis woman.
1109680	1111760	Whereas Caitlyn Jenner, whomst,
1111760	1112260	well,
1113840	1114560	just whomst.
1114560	1116480	She made millions of dollars in men's sports,
1116480	1118400	she had six children by three wives,
1118400	1120880	she transitioned in retirement at age 65,
1120880	1123520	and told BuzzFeed that the hardest part of being a woman
1123520	1125120	is figuring out what to wear.
1126400	1128960	This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.
1128960	1130000	It makes me want to cry.
1130240	1132160	I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,
1132160	1134080	but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue
1134080	1136400	that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective
1136400	1137920	doesn't have a leg to stand on.
1137920	1140960	But also, trans women often don't experience
1140960	1143120	male socialization the way cis men do.
1143120	1144960	Many trans women are feminine and queer
1144960	1146080	before they transition,
1146080	1148400	and have always experienced a kind of fem-phobia
1148400	1149760	that is rooted in misogyny.
1149760	1151680	Some trans women also identified as women
1151680	1153120	years before transitioning,
1153120	1155760	and internalized society's messaging about women
1155760	1157840	more than society's messaging about men.
1157840	1159920	Now that's still not the same as living in society
1159920	1161280	as a girl from birth,
1161280	1163680	but it's also pretty different from the socialization
1163680	1164880	of most cis men.
1164880	1167120	I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue
1167120	1169760	that trans women never experience male privilege
1169760	1172160	is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege
1172160	1173840	as a proxy for calling us men.
1174480	1175520	Pull up your zipper.
1175520	1178000	Your male privilege is hanging out.
1178000	1180640	I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point
1180640	1182480	for many gender-critical feminists
1182480	1185040	is that there's an element here of stolen valor,
1185040	1187440	this sense of injustice that people are claiming
1187440	1190000	their identity without experiencing their oppression.
1190000	1192080	It reminds me of what in the trans community
1192080	1194080	are called transmedicalists,
1194080	1196400	people who insist the only real trans people
1196400	1198720	are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.
1198720	1201360	In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing
1201360	1203920	that confirms your identity is pain.
1203920	1206800	What it is to be trans is to despise your body.
1206800	1210000	What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.
1210000	1212000	You didn't suffer like I've suffered.
1212000	1213520	You don't know what it's like.
1213520	1215520	You know, I'm tempted to strike back by saying
1215520	1218240	that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity
1218240	1220240	so stigmatized that most of the people
1220240	1221840	who are attracted to you in private
1221840	1223840	are too ashamed to admit it in public.
1223840	1225280	You don't know what it's like to have a body
1225280	1227040	so non-normative that you're shut out
1227040	1228560	of whole areas of society.
1228560	1231920	I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest
1231920	1233680	does nothing but to provoke infighting
1233680	1235520	between trans women and cis women
1235520	1237840	at a time when we should be marching side by side
1237840	1239680	to destroy video games forever.
1239680	1241120	Hashtag yes all gamers.
1241440	1242640	What, what, what?
1242640	1245360	Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.
1245360	1246960	You don't know what it's like to grow up
1246960	1250000	being shamed for your periods, to fear unwanted pregnancy,
1250000	1252000	to have to fight for your right to abortion,
1252000	1254320	to bear the pain of childbirth.
1254320	1257360	Well, yeah, that's true.
1257360	1260800	My inner Radfem sways in a gentle, victorious samba.
1260800	1262720	I do think it's important for trans women
1262720	1264480	to stand in solidarity with cis women
1264480	1266960	on issues like period equity and abortion rights,
1266960	1268880	and to learn about the experiences of cis women
1268880	1270480	to form a more complete understanding
1270480	1271680	of the female condition.
1271680	1274160	But of course no individual woman experiences
1274160	1275920	all the things women experience,
1275920	1278560	and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood
1278560	1280000	in drastically different ways.
1280000	1282480	For some women, having babies is the most essentially
1282480	1283680	womanly experience.
1283680	1286000	For others, maybe it's having an abortion.
1286000	1287920	I mean, not actually, but you know,
1287920	1289840	TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.
1289840	1292320	For me, it's receiving 12 paragraph emails
1292320	1294320	in my business inbox from married men
1294320	1296000	struggling through the existential crisis
1296000	1299040	of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.
1299040	1300400	Also, do you want to be a guest
1300400	1302560	on my podcast Free Speech Radio?
1302560	1305200	But also, not all women experience their womanhood
1305200	1306480	as essentially oppressive,
1306480	1308880	or centered around the pain of reproductive capacity.
1308880	1311280	When Shania Twain sang Man, I Feel Like a Woman,
1311280	1313680	she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion
1313680	1316320	in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.
1316320	1318800	Man, I feel like shit.
1318800	1321280	["I Feel Like a Woman"]
1321280	1324400	Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.
1324400	1326880	Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary
1326880	1329280	needed to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.
1329280	1331920	We are now expected to talk about pregnant people
1331920	1335360	and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.
1335360	1338560	Well, I, for one, am not a menstruator.
1338560	1343440	I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N, and I will not be erased.
1344560	1346720	Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator
1346720	1348640	or pregnant people and are thinking,
1348640	1350800	what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak
1350800	1352480	gender cuckoldry is that?
1352560	1355680	Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.
1355680	1357600	Some medical organizations have recently begun
1357600	1360480	using the term pregnant people instead of pregnant women.
1360480	1363200	And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word
1363200	1366240	menstruators in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.
1366240	1367920	This has prompted some conservative,
1367920	1369760	TERF, and Christian publications
1369760	1371680	to post panicked commentaries warning
1371680	1374240	that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.
1374240	1376640	But in fact, medical language that assumes
1376640	1378560	that everyone with a uterus is a woman
1378560	1380880	erases trans men, or non-binary people
1380880	1382480	who menstruate and get pregnant.
1382480	1385520	So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,
1385520	1387760	whereas saying pregnant people includes them
1387760	1390000	and cis women and doesn't erase anyone,
1390000	1391520	except for Cincinnatians,
1391520	1393440	because we all know they're not people.
1393440	1394960	Take your shitty chili elsewhere.
1394960	1397200	But I'm a woman, not a goddamn menstruator.
1397200	1399120	What kind of misogynistic madness is it
1399120	1401520	to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?
1401520	1403760	I actually agree with you that the word menstruator
1403760	1405440	sounds pretty dehumanizing,
1405440	1407200	and the trans men I've talked to about this
1407200	1408720	aren't the biggest fans of it either.
1408720	1410240	Sometimes it takes a while to settle
1410240	1413040	on language that's both inclusive and usable,
1413040	1415360	and my prediction is that menstruators
1415360	1416640	is not gonna work out.
1416640	1418320	Maybe people who menstruate?
1418320	1420000	But why can't I just say woman?
1420000	1420800	That's what I am.
1422080	1423840	You can't just say woman.
1423840	1425360	That is what you are.
1425360	1427360	No one is asking that you stop referring
1427360	1428720	to yourself as a woman.
1428720	1430800	Institutional medical language is designed
1430800	1433120	to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.
1433120	1435040	No one is proposing that we stop calling
1435040	1438080	individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.
1438080	1441040	Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.
1441040	1444000	I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.
1444000	1445680	I notice you're not suggesting doctors
1445680	1447840	start saying people with prostates.
1447840	1450240	Though I am definitely suggesting that.
1450240	1453040	But trans activists are invading feminist spaces
1453040	1455520	and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.
1455520	1458320	I have no problem with cis feminists discussing
1458320	1460800	or celebrating periods or wearing pussy hats
1460800	1463200	at political marches or free-bleeding
1463200	1464320	all over the National Mall.
1464320	1465520	I mean, someone has to.
1465520	1468080	The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.
1468080	1470720	I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate
1470720	1473760	their reproductive anatomy in defiance of a society
1473760	1476240	that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.
1476240	1478560	The problem arises only when menstruation
1478560	1481360	or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men
1481360	1483760	or exclude wombs whom stoth not bleed.
1483760	1485360	I mean, trans women do bleed,
1485360	1487600	but only when we cut ourselves.
1487600	1492880	No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.
1493600	1498000	Concern eight, TERF is a slur.
1498000	1501040	TERF is a slur designed to silence women.
1501040	1502800	Nay, it is hate speech designed
1502800	1504720	to incite violence against women.
1504720	1506960	The word TERF is a pejorative for a person
1506960	1509600	who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism,
1509600	1511040	but it's not a slur.
1511040	1513760	A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race,
1513760	1515680	religion, gender, or sexuality.
1515680	1517680	The word misogynist is pejorative,
1517680	1519520	it has only negative connotations,
1519520	1522400	and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.
1522400	1524480	It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs,
1524480	1525840	not a type of person.
1525840	1527680	The same is true of the word TERF.
1527680	1530480	It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors
1530480	1532400	that deserve to be derogated.
1532400	1535280	The term gender-critical is really a euphemism
1535280	1537280	recently created to replace TERF
1537280	1540160	with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.
1540160	1543040	It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race-realist,
1543040	1545680	which was invented by racists wanting a more flattering
1545680	1547920	and respectable description of their beliefs.
1547920	1550320	I've used the term gender-critical in this video
1550320	1552240	to be inviting to fence-sitters,
1552240	1554480	but I refuse to cooperate with racists
1554480	1556320	who want me to use their euphemisms,
1556320	1558880	and I generally do the same with TERFs.
1558880	1562000	Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.
1562000	1563280	I usually like to call people
1563280	1564800	by whatever they want to be called.
1564800	1567440	But when it comes to race-realist or gender-critical,
1568000	1569520	every time I use these phrases,
1569520	1571520	I'm essentially becoming an accomplice
1571520	1573680	in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.
1573680	1575920	And I have especially little patience
1575920	1578720	for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,
1578720	1580880	since most of the language used by TERFs
1580880	1584240	is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,
1584240	1586560	harmful, and insulting to trans people.
1586560	1589200	For instance, TERFs refer to any and all
1589200	1591840	trans-related surgery as mutilation.
1591840	1593680	They call trans women TIMs,
1593680	1596240	an acronym for trans-identified males,
1596240	1599760	and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,
1599760	1602800	obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.
1602800	1605360	Just to give you a sample of typical TERF prose,
1605360	1606640	here are a couple comments
1606640	1608400	from literally the first thread I saw
1608400	1609920	on the gender-critical subreddit
1609920	1611520	while I was working on this video.
1611520	1614480	And I have to admit to considerably more contempt
1614480	1616080	for the likes of ****,
1616080	1620400	since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,
1620400	1622640	insulting to women facial expressions.
1623280	1624960	I also get a good laugh
1624960	1627760	at TIMs putting their hands up to their shins.
1627760	1629680	They're trying to look all dainty
1629680	1631520	and to hide their Adam's apple,
1631520	1633440	but it only draws more attention
1633440	1635920	to their enormous man hands.
1635920	1639280	I saw an AGP photo shoot with this Neanderthal
1639280	1643280	in his 50s was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,
1643280	1645280	his hands dainty at his ear.
1646000	1649760	In every photo, even group ones at events.
1650480	1654080	Now I was just grossed out.
1654080	1655120	So there it is.
1655120	1656640	That's what this is really about.
1656640	1658080	In this video, I've gone through a list
1658080	1659760	of gender-critical concerns,
1659760	1661120	and I've provided responses
1661120	1662960	I hope the average person will find fair.
1662960	1665040	But I would be lying to you by omission
1665040	1666240	if I were to end this video
1666240	1667680	without being real with you
1667680	1670400	about what the core of the gender-critical movement
1670400	1672000	is actually about.
1672000	1673520	See, what TERFs do in public
1673520	1675360	is advance what, on the surface,
1675360	1677920	are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.
1677920	1678960	For example, the critique
1678960	1680400	that hyperfeminine trans women
1680400	1682560	are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes
1682560	1683920	designed to oppress women.
1683920	1685920	At a glance, this appears to be a critique
1685920	1688640	of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.
1688640	1689840	But in the next breath,
1689840	1691120	these same TERFs will argue
1691120	1693680	that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts
1693680	1696480	who are forcing masculinity into female spaces.
1696480	1698720	So if trans women being feminine is bad,
1698720	1700960	and trans women being masculine is bad,
1700960	1702400	then there really is no way
1702400	1705280	that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.
1705280	1707440	So in fact, what TERFs really oppose
1707440	1709200	is not trans women being feminine
1709200	1711040	or trans women being masculine,
1711040	1713760	but trans women being trans women.
1713760	1715600	In other words, the fundamental issue
1715600	1718000	underlying all these phony concerns
1718000	1720720	is transphobia, simple animosity
1720720	1722960	towards trans people's very existence.
1722960	1725120	And it's pretty easy to recognize that
1725120	1727600	just from the tone they use when they talk about us.
1727600	1729520	When you read through the gender-critical subreddit
1729520	1731600	or TERF Twitter, which you see
1731600	1734720	is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes
1734720	1737120	draped over a jagged thorn-tangle
1737120	1739600	of visceral disgust and targeted hate.
1739600	1742000	The pure exuberant malice of it all
1742000	1744560	is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote
1744560	1746000	from the opening of this video
1746000	1748400	or in the average gender-critical forum post.
1748400	1752000	The enormous, snuckly, hairy, beringed paw.
1752000	1754480	The pancake makeup through which the stubble
1754480	1755840	was already burgeoning.
1755840	1758160	This Neanderthal in his 50s.
1758160	1761520	Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.
1761520	1763760	Now I was just grossed out.
1763760	1766640	What gender-critical feminism really amounts to
1766640	1769600	is a Baroque palace of rationalizations
1769600	1773040	built on a foundation of pure disgust.
1773040	1775600	In this respect, it's just like homophobia.
1775600	1777360	You know, I came of age when gay marriage
1777360	1779200	was the most contentious social debate,
1779200	1780800	and the arguments people made
1780800	1782240	that marriage was under attack,
1782240	1784000	that the children would be traumatized,
1784080	1785920	that bestiality would be next,
1785920	1787840	that this tiny minority was undermining
1787840	1790160	all our institutions with their outrageous demands,
1790160	1792400	it was all just nonsense.
1792400	1794000	If you got a conservative drunk,
1794000	1795760	as I used to be able to do,
1795760	1797920	Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,
1797920	1799520	he would just blurt out the truth,
1799520	1801920	which was that the sight of two grown men
1801920	1804400	locking lips made him wanna bomb.
1804400	1806000	Homophobia and transphobia
1806000	1808400	do not originate in the frontal cortex.
1808400	1810960	They come from the lizard brain disgust response
1810960	1812560	we evolved to deal with blood,
1812640	1815200	infection, vomit, feces, flies,
1815200	1817760	the hairy paw, the stubble burgeoning
1817760	1818960	through the pancake makeup.
1819840	1822720	It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,
1822720	1824240	because it's the same disgust
1824240	1826800	I felt toward myself for years.
1826800	1829520	It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman
1829520	1832320	on the L platform in Chicago five years ago
1832320	1833600	and decided then and there
1833600	1836080	to abandon my first attempt at transition.
1836080	1839440	It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.
1839440	1841040	It's the disgust that's always
1841040	1842720	at the bottom of transphobia,
1842720	1845600	because transphobia is always the same.
1845600	1847520	It always comes from the same place,
1847520	1850320	and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.
1850320	1852880	I recently rewatched that classic viral video
1852880	1854560	from an old episode of Cops
1854560	1856320	where a police officer humiliates
1856320	1859200	a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.
1859200	1861840	The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID,
1861840	1863760	misgenders her, deadnames her,
1863760	1865120	mocks her clothes and makeup,
1865120	1866720	and calls her a crossdresser.
1866720	1868880	It's all so repetitive and familiar.
1868880	1871360	It's the same arsenal of petty sadism
1871360	1872880	you see in the right-wing press,
1872880	1875200	on 4chan, on doxing forums,
1875200	1876720	on gender-critical Reddit.
1876720	1878160	It's all the same.
1878160	1880640	What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair
1880640	1882640	is her unbreakable wit and confidence
1882640	1884480	in the face of transphobic abuse.
1884480	1886800	The single most iconic moment is when,
1886800	1888720	after being grilled in the back of the cop car
1888720	1891200	amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,
1891200	1893360	she glances back at the cop and says,
1893360	1895120	Excuse my beauty.
1895120	1896080	Excuse your beauty.
1896080	1896720	Okay.
1896720	1898400	And that, right there,
1898400	1902000	is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,
1902000	1904000	the resilience of trans women,
1904000	1906400	the assumption of a regal posture,
1906400	1908800	and even the most abject conditions.
1908800	1910880	And that's really all you can do,
1910880	1912480	because there's just no reasoning
1912480	1914160	a transphobe out of bigotry.
1914160	1916960	So, to any diehard gender-critical feminists
1916960	1918240	still watching this,
1918240	1920160	what else can I say except,
1920160	1921920	on behalf of all trans women,
1921920	1923040	excuse my beauty.
1923760	1924560	Turf.
1924640	1925440	Turf.
1925600	1926320	Turf.
1926480	1927280	Turf.
1927440	1928080	Turf.
1954560	1970240	I posted an invitation to Twitter for people who used to be gender-critical feminists
1970240	1974640	to chew me in the back of the head.
1974640	1976640	It's PC Ron Amac.
1976640	1978640	It's PC Ron Amac.
1978640	1980640	Look at him.
1980640	1982640	It's so stupid.
1982640	1984640	It's so stupid.
1984640	1986640	It's PC Ron Amac.
1986640	1988640	Corona Premiere.
1988640	1990640	Turf beer of choice.
1990640	1992640	My chromosomes need to unwind after a hard day of hating trans people.
1992640	1994640	It is absurd.
1994640	1996640	These titties.
1996640	1998640	I just saw them and I just lost it.
1998640	2000640	I just.
2000640	2002640	It's just.
2002640	2004640	What?
2004640	2006640	What?
2006640	2008640	I am a W-M-B-Y-N.
2008640	2010640	You do know how I struggle with spelling.
2010640	2012640	V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.
2012640	2014640	V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.
2014640	2016640	V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.
2016640	2018640	No one knows what it's like
2018640	2020640	to be a sad trans.
2020640	2022640	To be a trash can
2022640	2024640	for trap chasers.
2024640	2026640	For trap chasers.
2026640	2028640	Perfect.
