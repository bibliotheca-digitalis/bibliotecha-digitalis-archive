1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,960
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,960
We have to dial in.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,240
This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,080
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,160
There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,720
there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,040
One twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,240
and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,200
So when the day arrived, and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,400
out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,200
that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean if you weren't

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,440
on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,880
rich white kids.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,960
Yuppie hunger games hosted by Ja Rule.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,400
Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Let them eat salad.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,960
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,000
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,240
sandwiches were garbage.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:08,120
Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,760
Imagine looking like this.

26
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,360
Imagine being perfect.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,520
Why are you doing this to women?

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila,

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Your skin is so perfect, uwu.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,000
And Jamila replied,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,560
My skin is currently clear because A. Privileged people have more access to good

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,360
quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those with less privilege.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,640
I also get to sleep more because of this.

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,880
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
easily.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,960
B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,680
C. I exfoliate twice a week.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh boy.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, gorge.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll protect you, queen.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,080
Could she be any more annoying?

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,920
Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,480
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,000
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,800
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,640
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality,

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
does it?

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,440
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
your privilege.

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,160
A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,360
now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to it.

55
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Take me, mother.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
of the coronavirus pandemic.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,280
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,200
normal for just a brief moment in time.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,800
I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so

66
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,840
in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,560
Hashtag thisis40, tag me bitch.

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,000
So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege-checking maneuver, and once again,

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
it has not gone well.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,080
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century, bragging about being humble and letting us

71
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
eat cake.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,640
evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?

74
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,400
Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone-deaf humbled and blessed line, hashtag

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
gross.

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
Happy birthday, mmm.

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,760
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read the motherfucking-

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,720
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,480
was not that she had the party, I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got

80
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
that milf money?

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,040
The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,680
a little bit yikesy.

83
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,720
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,400
This isn't a good look, we say.

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,880
Bad optics.

86
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Not relatable.

87
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Relatable.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,160
Relatability is not a moral category.

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,600
This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,840
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

92
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,400
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
This should have stayed in the drafts.

94
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Hashtag tone-deaf.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,200
We didn't get to have birthday parties, some people couldn't even travel to visit

97
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
their dying relatives.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,920
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.

99
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,000
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,680
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

101
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,760
music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jameel's privileged pores,

102
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
no one ever uses the word envy.

103
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,440
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
own psychology.

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,840
So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.

106
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,920
What is it, where does it come from, and seriously, what is Jameela Jameel's skincare routine?

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
Drop it in the comments, bestie.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,560
Okay, so what is envy?

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

110
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,200
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
what we want, but cannot get.

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,560
It's not simply wanting what another person has, that's greed, which is a much more

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
wholesome sin.

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,320
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,000
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,400
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy, it's emulation or admiration.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,760
At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
It covets.

119
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
they have.

121
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,200
You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated

122
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,640
and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Like Satan, who was willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John Milfton.

124
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,120
It's gonna be 90 minutes of Milf jokes, kids, so strap in.

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,040
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,360
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

127
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,560
celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,440
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,

129
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,880
masculine men.

130
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,040
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

131
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,560
want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

132
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,200
Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.

133
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,520
So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's emulation,

134
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,080
the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more popular option,

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
you can take the black pill.

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Which means believing that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no

137
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,160
woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.

138
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,320
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire wikipedia

139
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
timeline dedicated to tracking them.

140
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,960
And the essential motivation for this violence is envy.

141
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,600
The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable predestined inferiority turns venomous.

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,200
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,

143
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
then no one can.

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
In the words of a murderer,

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,880
The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.

146
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
But most incels aren't murderers.

147
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,720
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

150
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
Because the other sins are fun, right?

151
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
Greed, gluttony, lust?

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
That's what I call a good time.

153
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,520
But envy is misery.

154
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,720
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

155
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,480
Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would

156
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
be like without rich parents.

157
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,540
Yes.

158
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Rich refugee crisis.

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
Look around you.

161
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,400
We've got the guillotine memes.

162
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,280
We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.

163
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
And none of this is new.

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

165
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,720
Jaja Gabor, who supposedly said,

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,800
When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.

167
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
And fair enough, it's a good source of protein.

168
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
But take it from me kids,

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,440
cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

170
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
It's hard to do just once.

171
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
You develop a taste for it.

172
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
It's like they say at NA meetings,

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,960
once you've lured, you just want more.

174
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,040
Also, who counts as the rich?

175
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
Am I the rich?

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat.

177
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,980
EAT.

178
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,300
Stop it.

179
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
See, this is why I quit academia.

180
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

181
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
And I don't want to behave myself.

182
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
I want to be bad.

183
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
Do you want to be bad with me?

184
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
Let's be bad.

185
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:49,600
So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality,

186
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,960
and that societies that have more inequality have more envy.

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
I used to assume that too.

188
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
But the more I think about it, the more I realize,

189
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
that might not be true.

190
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Envy is a basic part of human nature.

191
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,520
It exists in all societies and all economic systems,

192
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,080
and it begins any time two or more people start comparing themselves.

193
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,040
Part Two.

194
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
The Desire for Mommy's Milk.

195
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,640
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy,

196
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
Daddy!

197
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,800
The first stage of human development is the oral stage,

198
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,240
in which the primary concern is oral gratification,

199
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
which is of course provided by mommy milkies.

200
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
Am I doing too much?

201
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll tone it down just a little bit.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,840
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud,

203
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,960
and it's true, he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend

204
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
who had some zany ideas.

205
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
Like penis envy.

206
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,800
Maybe there's transgender men who experience that,

207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
but I don't think it's a basic fact of the female condition.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
Because I take that personally.

210
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
But I feel like even when Freud is wrong,

212
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
he's often at least onto something.

213
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Like with the Oedipus Complex,

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,480
it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?

215
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
That would be weird.

216
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
It's more that you desire an archetype.

217
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
Mother, right?

218
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,200
Mommy.

219
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
You guys get it.

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.

221
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,160
They're the ones who got me started on this milk shit.

222
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm a reverse Socrates.

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,120
I've been corrupted by the young.

224
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.

225
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,120
So Freud says that in the first two years of life,

226
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk.

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,080
And it's also in this stage that envy first emerges.

228
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,320
So I was the oldest child in my family,

229
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,960
and I was less than two years old when my brother was born.

230
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,520
So I don't remember this because I was one year old,

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,480
but my family tells me that when my brother was born,

232
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,040
I was just insanely jealous.

233
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,480
Oh, and I guess now's a good time

234
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,280
to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.

235
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Scholars agree that there is a difference,

236
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,440
and usually they describe the difference

237
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
in one of two ways.

238
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,520
The first is that jealousy is defensive.

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,720
It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours.

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
Whereas envy is offensive.

241
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,400
It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

242
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,240
And the second difference is that envy

243
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,200
is between two people, the envier and the envied,

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,680
whereas jealousy typically involves three people.

245
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,400
As in romantic jealousy, where you have the subject,

246
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,800
the romantic object, and then the rival.

247
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And the subject is jealous of the rival

248
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
because they're protective of their relationship

249
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
with the romantic object.

250
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
And that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry,

251
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
just substituting the romantic object for mommy.

252
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,520
Of course in ordinary English,

253
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,200
people are always gonna say jealousy

254
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,880
when they really mean envy,

255
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,320
probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.

256
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
And I think it's pointless to try to fight that,

257
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
like I wouldn't go around correcting people,

258
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
but just keep in mind that there is a difference.

259
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?

260
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,840
Well I think it's both,

261
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
because initially you're defensive

262
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,080
of your privileged only child relationship

263
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
with your parents.

264
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,840
But a new baby often gets more attention,

265
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,160
at least in your paranoid toddler brain,

266
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
and you might be envious of that.

267
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
And in romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival

268
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,840
if she has qualities that you wish you had.

269
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,000
You know, young kids are little egotists

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
who are very sensitive to when another child

271
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
might be getting preferential treatment.

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,840
One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,000
is it's not fair.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
It's not fair.

275
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,040
Tell me about it, Pampino.

276
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,080
And I've got bad news.

277
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
Life is not getting any more fair than this.

278
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
According to the Bible,

279
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
one of the first events in human history

280
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
is the story of Cain y Abel, los dos hermanos.

281
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
I don't know why I said it in Spanish.

282
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,560
I guess I just thought it would sound cool.

283
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Was I wrong?

284
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,200
Cain.

285
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
It just sounds so much better than Cain.

286
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,720
Cain and Abel.

287
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,560
Cain and Abel.

288
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,520
God tells Cain and Abel each to make a sacrifice,

289
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,680
and then God prefers Abel's.

290
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
You know, because God loves meat.

291
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,840
Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel,

292
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,760
in spite towards God the Father,

293
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Cain kills his younger brother.

294
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,480
In my earliest memories of my brother,

295
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,840
I already loved him,

296
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,680
and I don't remember the envy.

297
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
So I guess I wasn't a Cain.

298
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Cain.

299
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
So I must have somehow worked through this

300
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
without resorting to murder.

301
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger

302
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
leads to a recognition of impotence.

303
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,640
Because at first,

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,320
you selfishly want to be the special most-loved child.

305
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,480
But you see that your parents love your sibling

306
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,520
just as much as you,

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,240
and you're powerless to do anything about it.

308
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
So your ambition to superiority fails.

309
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
And so you have no choice

310
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
but to repress your ambition to superiority

311
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,200
as well as your envy.

312
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
And the result of that repression

313
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
is what we could call herd instinct.

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
Solidarity.

315
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,760
This feeling of identifying with a group,

316
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,120
the equal siblings.

317
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
And as you get older,

318
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,120
the herd instinct evolves into feelings about

319
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
justice, duty, community, and equality.

320
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
But Freud thought these feelings

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,680
retain a vestige of repressed envy.

322
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,440
If I can't be the favorite,

323
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,600
if I can't have special privileges,

324
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
then no one can.

325
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,840
And from these observations,

326
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Freud made the generalization,

327
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,000
Social justice means that we deny ourselves

328
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,560
many things so that others

329
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,280
may have to do without them as well.

330
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
Okay, so we don't want other people

331
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,520
to have anything we can't have.

332
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
So we enviously insist on equality

333
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
as a defense against

334
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
the greater prosperity of others.

335
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,720
Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.

336
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,080
Like I think Freud is definitely

337
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
onto something here.

338
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
But don't some of our community feelings

339
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
also come from a place of

340
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
genuine care for other people?

341
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,200
I cared for someone once.

342
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Rosalind.

343
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
Well, we'll come back to that later.

344
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
Let's put a pin in me for now.

345
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,760
A pin in it for now.

346
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,800
In Freud, I mean.

347
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
Let's put a pin in Freud.

348
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,680
In a 1966 book titled Envy,

349
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
A Theory of Social Behavior,

350
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
the sociologist Helmut Schuck argued

351
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
that rather than being,

352
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
that is a very German name.

353
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Helmut Schuck?

354
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
It's putting me in a German mood, sweetie.

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,280
Hallo meine Lieben.

356
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
Heute gibt's ein neues Video.

357
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
I just get worse at German every year.

358
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,280
Schuck argued that rather than being

359
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
the result of social or economic inequality,

360
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,120
envy is a universal across all human societies,

361
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
including very egalitarian ones.

362
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
For example, in tribal and village cultures

363
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
around the world,

364
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
there's often a concept of black magic

365
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
or witchcraft,

366
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,280
which are thought to be used by envious people

367
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,360
to bewitch the ones they envy.

368
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
You're probably familiar with the concept

369
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
of the evil eye,

370
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
which originates in ancient Greece

371
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,600
or maybe even earlier than that.

372
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
Cultures all over the world today

373
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
understand the evil eye as a kind of curse

374
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
cast by the malignant gaze of an envious person.

375
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,640
Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious,

376
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
but I actually think the concept of the evil eye

377
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy

378
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
and of the social danger that it poses.

379
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
You've probably seen these amulets around,

380
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
there's an emoji for them now,

381
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
which are supposed to protect against the evil eye.

382
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,040
It's called a nazar,

383
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,160
which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance,

384
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
similar to the origin of the English word envy,

385
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,920
which is the Latin invidia,

386
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,840
which just means to look at.

387
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
So there's an agreement across cultures

388
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
that envy is related to sight,

389
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
the malevolent gaze,

390
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
the evil eye.

391
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,400
And these amulets show that a lot of people

392
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
are afraid of being envied

393
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
and want to protect themselves.

394
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel

395
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
with an episode on the evil eye

396
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,560
and the host explains that for Muslims,

397
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,000
it's customary to say,

398
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,800
or God has willed it when admiring a person or object,

399
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.

400
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,920
I love that.

401
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,880
It's like no envy,

402
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,640
like no homo, but no envy.

403
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
Mashallah.

404
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,840
The top comment on that video says,

405
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
See, this is where Kim Kardashian

406
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
went wrong with her birthday post.

407
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
Clearly, no one in the Kardashian cinematic universe

408
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,120
has ever heard of the evil eye.

409
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.

410
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
Why haven't they heard of the evil eye?

411
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
Oh, okay, nevermind.

412
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,200
Every piece of media they've ever produced

413
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,840
is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.

414
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
This is a particularly American thing.

415
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,720
Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.

416
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,520
Like there's advertisements here that literally promise,

417
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,120
if you buy this exclusive luxury vibrator,

418
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
you'll be the envy of all your friends.

419
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
As if it's a good thing to be envied.

420
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,120
Oh, but it is not.

421
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,760
If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?

422
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,840
They seethe over your successes

423
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
and celebrate your misfortunes.

424
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.

425
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,760
So why would anyone want to be envied?

426
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.

427
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,000
On the one hand, we need to be loved,

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
but then there's this other drive in us,

429
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,280
this like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches,

430
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,320
which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved.

431
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,640
In a past Gilded Age, there were stories

432
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard,

433
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,320
which warned what a sad and lonely thing

434
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
success can become.

435
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,680
In ancient democratic Athens,

436
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,560
there was a practice called ostrachismus,

437
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,600
which is the origin of the English word ostracism.

438
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
Ostracism was a procedure

439
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
where the Athenians would assemble

440
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
and each person would write the name

441
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,280
of a person they wanted to ostracize

442
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,840
on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

443
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,360
And whoever got the most votes

444
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
would simply be banished from the city for 10 years,

445
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
no questions asked.

446
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
I love the ancient world.

447
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Things were so direct.

448
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Often this was used to remove someone

449
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant

450
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,720
or just annoying.

451
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,160
According to Plutarch,

452
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,920
I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia,

453
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,840
in one anecdote about Aristides,

454
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,160
known as Aristides the Just,

455
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,480
who was ostracized in 482,

456
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,040
an illiterate citizen not recognizing him

457
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
came up to ask him to write the name Aristides

458
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
on his ostracon.

459
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,240
When Aristides asked why,

460
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
the man replied,

461
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
it was because he was sick of hearing him

462
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,560
being called the Just.

463
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,480
It's good!

464
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
It's so good!

465
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,880
See this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

466
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

467
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
People in most cultures,

468
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,920
not all,

469
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
but most cultures understand

470
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
that being envied is a massive social liability,

471
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

472
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
According to a Tamil saying,

473
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,160
the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

474
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,720
This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome

475
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,920
because the tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.

476
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,560
Shook argues that the fear of envy

477
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,600
is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

478
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
In Haiti,

479
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,240
G.E. Simpson found that a peasant

480
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
will seek to disguise his true economic position

481
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
by purchasing several smaller fields

482
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
rather than one larger piece of land.

483
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
For the same reason,

484
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
he will not wear good clothes.

485
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,480
He does this intentionally

486
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,040
to protect himself against the envious black magic

487
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,000
of his neighbors.

488
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America.

489
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,360
Like I've known people from seriously wealthy families

490
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,560
who move to the city

491
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
and they dress like gutter punks,

492
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,880
like they're trying to pass as poor.

493
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
But in general,

494
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,440
Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy

495
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,120
in the way many other cultures do,

496
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
and I don't think that's an accident.

497
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
We're a nation of show-offs,

498
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,640
and so the taboo against discussing envy

499
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,560
is related to our whole national ethos

500
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,560
of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

501
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
But though the fear of envy

502
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,080
isn't widely talked about or admitted here,

503
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,520
it's definitely still there,

504
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640
only repressed,

505
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
confined to the realm of dreams and art.

506
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
In the movie Black Swan,

507
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,040
Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina

508
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
who achieves her dream

509
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
of getting the lead role in Swan Lake,

510
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,680
after which her life and mind

511
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,880
are totally unraveled by fear of envy.

512
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,920
Black magic,

513
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
Black Swan.

514
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
At first we see how Nina's success

515
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,160
comes at the very real cost of being envied,

516
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,080
by her ex-ballerina mother,

517
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
by the other girls in the company,

518
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,120
and by the former lead ballerina she's replaced.

519
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
Did you suck his c***?

520
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
Not all of us have to.

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
I love Winona Ryder so much.

522
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
I love Natalie Portman so much.

523
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I love Mila Kunis so much.

524
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,160
I just like women.

525
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,840
Where's my shock wand?

526
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,560
Stop it.

527
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,440
Stop standing.

528
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,480
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia,

529
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
as Nina begins hallucinating

530
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
Black Swan doppelgangers,

531
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis,

532
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
who's trying to steal her role.

533
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,800
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

534
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
They'll getcha.

535
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
Did you have some sort of

536
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,600
lesbian dream about me?

537
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,160
Stop.

538
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering

539
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
a kind of self-envy,

540
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,080
where she envies the disinhibited,

541
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,440
sexually liberated,

542
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
corrupted part of herself

543
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,440
that's capable of adult eroticism,

544
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
and also of dancing the Black Swan.

545
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
So she imagines that part of herself

546
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,200
as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

547
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,560
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

548
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,800
There's her dominant White Swan impulse,

549
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,760
which we could call the Squidward personality,

550
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,680
perfectionistic and orderly,

551
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,960
but reserved,

552
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,920
priggish,

553
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
stiff.

554
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse,

555
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,680
which we could call the SpongeBob personality,

556
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,640
intuitive,

557
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
chaotic,

558
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,320
ecstatic.

559
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
In SpongeBob SquarePants,

560
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,880
the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy,

561
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
stemming from failed ambition.

562
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,400
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

563
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,560
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement

564
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,160
but remains a mediocrity,

565
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,040
partly because of his overly dry,

566
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,520
doctrinaire attitude towards art.

567
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal.

568
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
They're literally neighbors,

569
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,920
and they both work the same fast food service job

570
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,320
for the same exploitative capitalist.

571
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,760
But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius

572
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,800
who's able to transform the most mundane activities,

573
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
blowing bubbles,

574
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,200
flipping burgers,

575
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

576
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,280
Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy

577
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,120
and intuitive creativity,

578
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,680
but he can't admit that envy to himself.

579
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling

580
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,560
is contempt,

581
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,400
snobbish disdain for SpongeBob's childish behavior.

582
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,120
What the people want is culture,

583
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,040
not dancing bubbles.

584
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,920
Though deep down,

585
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.

586
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
It's beautiful.

587
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,560
Uh, I mean, uh.

588
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,080
Which we see when he can't help himself

589
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,440
from blowing bubbles,

590
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
or when he trades away all of his possessions

591
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,160
for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands

592
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,320
was a source of infinite entertainment.

593
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,280
A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid

594
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,480
re-watch it now,

595
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
and are horrified to discover

596
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,840
that they identify with Squidward,

597
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,040
whereas as children,

598
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,720
they identified with SpongeBob.

599
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,400
Well, you either die as SpongeBob,

600
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,160
or you live long enough to see yourself

601
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,120
become the Squidward.

602
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,920
FUTURE!

603
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,080
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward,

604
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,920
which is usually explained as

605
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,400
the disappointing drudgery of adult life,

606
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,240
or simply loss of childhood.

607
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
I would argue that envy of childhood

608
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,680
is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

609
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
Squidwardian?

610
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
Are we saying that word?

611
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,440
Are we really saying that word out loud?

612
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,360
To an audience of millions?

613
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay!

614
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
It's basically the same dynamic

615
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,040
as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

616
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,680
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!

617
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,440
You gotta watch out for that one, kids.

618
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,280
If a mysterious stranger shows up

619
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,720
on your doorstep at midnight

620
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,840
asking you to compose a requiem mass for your own father,

621
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
just say no.

622
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants,

623
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
we have a diligent though stuffy wannabe,

624
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,160
envying the effortless playfulness

625
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,760
of the spontaneous genius.

626
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:25,520
Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is,

627
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,080
well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

628
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants

629
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,320
through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,

630
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,

631
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
we could say that Squidward represents

632
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,640
what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,

633
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.

634
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
Nietzsche thought there were two

635
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

636
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo,

637
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,680
is the drive towards self-control, order, logic, morality.

638
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,240
And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus,

639
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,960
is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.

640
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,640
Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives

641
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,360
in conflict, with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.

642
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
Of course, this is a misrepresentation

643
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
of how art is actually created,

644
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,280
because Nietzsche's whole point is that

645
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,520
you need a balance of the two drives.

646
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,880
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist

647
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,760
like SpongeBob, because creating good art

648
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,040
requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.

649
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,200
See? It is all in the technique.

650
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,840
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

651
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,120
Get off the stage!

652
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,880
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

653
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
In order to give the perfect performance,

654
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
Mina has to unify her fragmented personality

655
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,680
and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry

656
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
between her two artistic impulses.

657
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,600
It was perfect.

658
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:59,520
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina-doppelgangers

659
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
Can you guess it?

660
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,120
is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,

661
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,880
which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear

662
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
of the American middle class.

663
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family

664
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,560
with a vacation house and a boat,

665
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,960
along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family

666
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
whom the Wilsons envy.

667
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,400
Saw their new car, right?

668
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,120
You had to do it.

669
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,920
You just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.

670
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,400
One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded

671
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,760
by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

672
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,560
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,

673
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,600
explains that her family is metaphysically tethered

674
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,960
to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions

675
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,160
of their lives in a liminal backroom's underworld.

676
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,520
It's super fucking liminal.

677
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.

678
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,320
Not again.

679
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
Once upon a time, there was a girl,

680
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,360
and the girl had a shadow.

681
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,120
The two were connected, tethered together.

682
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,080
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.

683
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,400
But when the shadow was hungry,

684
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,560
she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

685
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,680
We later find out that all over the US,

686
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,000
O-U-S spells us.

687
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
Hey, that's the title of the movie.

688
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,880
Ohhhhh.

689
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,200
The tethered have risen up to kill

690
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,280
their privileged doppelgangers,

691
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,520
and to link arms across the country

692
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,440
in a dark parody of the real world

693
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,600
1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across America.

694
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,800
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression

695
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,680
of middle class guilt about privilege,

696
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
and fear of envy.

697
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
It's not a movie about the working class.

698
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,520
If it was a movie about the working class,

699
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,880
then the working class would be able

700
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,320
to speak human languages,

701
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
and would not be scary monsters

702
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,120
who make animal sounds

703
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
and stagger around like zombies.

704
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,600
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's

705
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
nightmare of the working class.

706
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Us represents in a self-aware way

707
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,920
what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

708
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,080
The fear of the envious poor,

709
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,880
of revolution, of slave revolt.

710
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,040
Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.

711
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,840
But Us diverges from other home invasion movies

712
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,800
by not just being fearful about the underclass,

713
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
but also guilty.

714
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,360
The idea of the tethered underclass

715
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,840
represents life as a zero-sum game

716
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,160
where every moment of your happiness

717
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,280
is bought with someone else's suffering.

718
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,680
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy,

719
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,280
an internalization of the black magic logic

720
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,000
of people who blame their own misfortunes

721
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
on the people they envy.

722
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,800
As Shook puts it,

723
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
my neighbor's harvest

724
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,920
can only have turned out better than mine

725
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,600
because he has somehow succeeded

726
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
in reducing mine by black magic.

727
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,040
So the fear of envy and the guilt of success

728
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,280
are repressed in American culture,

729
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,600
but they still find expression in movies.

730
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
Jordan Peele is kind of like

731
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.

732
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,160
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol,

733
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,840
a story about the guilt of the rich

734
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,040
if ever there was one.

735
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts

736
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
who show him how wretched and sad

737
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,040
the lives of his employees are,

738
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,160
and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone,

739
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,720
and his funeral is only attended by businessmen

740
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,280
on the condition that lunch is provided.

741
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,960
Dickens was truly the master

742
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,800
of scaring the rich straight.

743
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,560
So maybe fear of envy

744
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,280
can serve a softly regulatory function

745
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,640
by motivating charity and generosity in the rich.

746
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,760
But in general,

747
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,200
I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.

748
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,400
Because remember,

749
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,480
the basic logic of envy is,

750
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,920
if I can't have it, then no one can.

751
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,160
Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.

752
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,320
It's taking privileges away,

753
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,120
not for the material benefit of the underprivileged,

754
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,400
but merely for the psychological satisfaction

755
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,840
of the envious person.

756
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
And that's even worse when you consider

757
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
that envy is subjective.

758
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
It doesn't necessarily target

759
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,680
objective power and privilege.

760
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,800
So envy in politics is not by any means

761
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,320
relegated to the left.

762
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,880
Conservative politics is brimming with envy.

763
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,840
Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt,

764
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,360
you often hear people say,

765
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,440
I had to pay my student loans,

766
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
so they should too.

767
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,920
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

768
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
The logic here is,

769
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,200
since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,

770
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,120
no one should.

771
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,520
It's intergenerational envy,

772
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,120
which is a pretty common thing.

773
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,320
Usually older generations envying the young.

774
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Kids these days have it so easy.

775
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,280
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast

776
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,560
and sent text messages on the Pony Express.

777
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
The feeling is basically,

778
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,480
it's not fair that kids these days

779
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,960
don't have to suffer like I suffered.

780
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,160
Or think about the concept of a welfare queen,

781
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,440
which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

782
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,080
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.

783
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,400
It's all this envious suspicion

784
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
about illegal immigrants sneaking in

785
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,560
and getting government handouts

786
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
without having to pay taxes.

787
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
I had to work hard for my money,

788
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,320
so why should these people get a free ride?

789
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,080
Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant

790
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,280
is actually like,

791
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,280
except in the imagination of people who envy them.

792
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,800
Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people,

793
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,320
so it's especially sharp when it targets people

794
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,600
who are supposed to be beneath you.

795
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,320
The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin

796
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,120
made what I think is a pretty compelling argument

797
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,400
that both anti-Semitism and misogyny

798
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,240
are partly rooted in envy.

799
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,080
She quotes a bigoted argument

800
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,400
made by the wife-killing protagonist

801
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,280
of Tolstoy's story, The Kreutzer Sonata,

802
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,520
who resents that women and Jews

803
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
find a kind of paradoxical power in their own oppression.

804
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
Just like the Jews,

805
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,720
as they pay us back for their oppression

806
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,320
by financial domination,

807
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,600
so it is with women.

808
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,080
Ah, you want us to be traitors only?

809
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,880
All right.

810
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,840
As traitors, we will dominate you, say the Jews.

811
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,800
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

812
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,520
All right.

813
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
As objects of sensuality, we will enslave you.

814
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,360
Dworkin explains,

815
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,840
This dominance of men by women

816
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,240
is experienced by the men as real,

817
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,520
emotionally real,

818
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,800
sexually real,

819
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
psychologically real.

820
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,760
It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.

821
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
The woman appears to control sex.

822
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
The man needs it.

823
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,920
This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.

824
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,880
Women control access to what men want,

825
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
which gives women a kind of indirect power

826
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,120
that some men envy.

827
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,000
They envy the sexual power of women.

828
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,320
It doesn't matter to the misogynist that,

829
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,

830
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,320
women objectively have less power in society than men.

831
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,640
He envies women because they have what he desires.

832
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,160
Likewise, it didn't matter to Weimar anti-Semites

833
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,200
that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

834
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,520
Anti-Semitism is often rooted in an envious obsession

835
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,080
with the disproportionate influence

836
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,320
and affluence of Jewish people.

837
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,640
It is not the absolute differences between men

838
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
which feed envy,

839
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,440
but subjective perception,

840
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
the optics of envy.

841
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Magic mirror on the wall.

842
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Who's the cuntest of them all?

843
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,960
Thou art cunt, my queen.

844
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,440
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

845
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
Oh, yes, it's me.

846
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
What?

847
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning

848
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
of this whole transition.

849
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm not sure what to expect.

850
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm kind of just in the beginning

851
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,200
of this whole transition.

852
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
You know, like a young little girl

853
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,960
going through all these things,

854
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
having a sleepover with the girls.

855
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,480
What do we do on a sleepover?

856
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?

857
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,920
Alas, she is more cunt than thee.

858
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,160
My pussy stunting on the Gram has come to nothing.

859
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
The classic 1937 Disney movie

860
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,240
Snow White and the Wicked Milf

861
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,680
is the story of a, quote,

862
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,360
vain and wicked queen

863
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,800
who obsessively envies

864
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
the beauty of her own stepdaughter.

865
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
Are you sure this one's for children?

866
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,120
Every day the milf queen asks the mirror

867
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,720
who is the fairest one of all,

868
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,840
and the mirror responds

869
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,440
that the queen is the fairest,

870
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,800
till one day it says

871
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,120
the stepdaughter Snow White is the fairest,

872
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,440
which sends the queen into an envious fury,

873
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.

874
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
So first of all, can we talk plot holes, ding?

875
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,360
Are we really supposed to believe

876
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,320
that this is more beautiful than this?

877
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,920
Uh, ding.

878
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?

879
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
What's going on, Walt?

880
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,840
Why don't you take a seat?

881
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

882
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,560
It's hard to tell

883
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,120
because she's constantly surrounded by manlets,

884
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,120
but she's just so boring,

885
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,400
and the queen is such a baddie.

886
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,240
Step on my throat, mother.

887
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
This is a horny video.

888
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.

889
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

890
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
So despite the injustice done to its lead milf,

891
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,720
Snow White does illustrate

892
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,320
some interesting things about envy.

893
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,040
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft

894
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,560
as an expression of envy.

895
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
We have the age difference,

896
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,200
intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.

897
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women

898
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,160
who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

899
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
to rage against Gen Z.

900
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
Pretty counterproductive,

901
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,600
since if you're worried about seeming old,

902
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,040
complaining about the youths,

903
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
it's probably not helping your case gorge.

904
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,440
You might wonder if there's also jealousy

905
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,960
involved with the evil queen.

906
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,640
Is she worried that the king

907
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,960
is gonna fall in love with his own daughter?

908
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,480
Well, I don't think so,

909
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
because we never even see the king.

910
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
The queen doesn't mention him.

911
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,120
It's not about the king.

912
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,600
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

913
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
It's just one woman envying another woman

914
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
over beauty for its own sake.

915
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,080
We stan a Bechdel test passing

916
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,880
movie about women hating each other.

917
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,120
Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gas keep, light boss.

918
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,440
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,

919
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,520
the queen first tries killing Snow White

920
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,040
with beauty accessories,

921
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
poisoning a comb,

922
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
and lacing her to death with a corset.

923
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
I wish I could die that way.

924
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,400
What's really striking

925
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,000
is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.

926
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,120
This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look,

927
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,000
is willing to transform herself with witchcraft

928
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
into an ugly old hag,

929
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,960
just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.

930
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,360
And the queen disguising herself as an old hag

931
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,320
parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.

932
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,440
I mean, you could actually argue

933
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,160
that the queen is simply a persona of Satan,

934
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
it's paradise lost all over again,

935
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,720
which also happens to be the title of my memoir.

936
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,560
The queen is incredibly petty,

937
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,880
because even according to the, again,

938
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
wrong and tasteless mirror,

939
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.

940
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,160
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy

941
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,560
still be consumed by envy?

942
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,720
Well, basically, because that's how envy works.

943
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
It's petty, it's subjective,

944
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,240
and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,

945
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,520
or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.

946
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,080
So you can be the second best in the world,

947
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,880
and still be obsessively envious

948
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,240
of the one person who may barely even be above you.

949
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,600
In fact, there's studies showing

950
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,280
that Olympic silver medalists

951
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,760
are actually less satisfied with their prize

952
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
than bronze medalists,

953
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,960
probably because the bronze medalist

954
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,120
is just happy to be on the podium at all,

955
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,400
while the silver medalist is so close to first,

956
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,720
they can't help but wonder, what if?

957
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,600
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth

958
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,320
not by comparing ourselves to any absolute standard,

959
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,400
but by comparing ourselves to each other,

960
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,320
and we're more likely to compare ourselves

961
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,160
to the people who are around us

962
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
than we are to people who are far away.

963
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,520
We could call this the proximity effect of envy.

964
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,480
We're more likely to envy people who are close to us,

965
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,920
or similar to us,

966
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
especially people we're in competition with.

967
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,720
That's why social media is such a nightmare.

968
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,400
It's an incubator of envy,

969
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,120
because it puts everyone next to everyone else.

970
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,400
So we're all being compared, all in competition,

971
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,800
and it can destroy your self-esteem,

972
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,360
because you're comparing your actual life

973
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,440
to these idealized images.

974
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,200
And it also turns public figures

975
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,280
into lightning rods for envy,

976
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,200
because of the numeric visibility of popularity and success.

977
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect

978
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,920
that envy within an oppressed class

979
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,240
is often more venomous and obsessive

980
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,840
than envy for the oppressor.

981
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,360
So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan,

982
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,000
you have women envying other women,

983
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,800
because women are often in competition with each other.

984
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,120
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

985
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,280
In media, there's constant portrayals

986
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
of vain and envious women.

987
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,560
Jealous bitches fighting over men.

988
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
Over youth.

989
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
Over beauty.

990
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,040
It's like drag queen femininity.

991
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,800
Death becomes her femininity.

992
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,640
-"En garde, bitch!"

993
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope,

994
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,640
but, how do I put this delicately,

995
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
sometimes reality is misogynistic.

996
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,440
Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on!

997
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,240
The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.

998
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,320
In her 1976 essay Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood,

999
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,120
feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism

1000
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,040
from within the women's movement.

1001
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,160
-"I've been watching for years with increasing dismay

1002
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,360
as the movement consciously destroys anyone within it

1003
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,280
who stands out in any way."

1004
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,560
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.

1005
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
-"And who do they attack?

1006
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,240
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind

1007
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,160
would seem to be the worst crime.

1008
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,480
Do anything that every other woman secretly

1009
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,200
or otherwise feels she could do just as well,

1010
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,400
and you're in for it.

1011
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,760
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist,

1012
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,720
a ruthless mercenary out to make her fame and fortune

1013
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,200
over the dead bodies of selfless sisters

1014
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,120
who have buried their abilities

1015
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,040
and sacrificed their ambitions

1016
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,920
for the greater glory of feminism."

1017
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,280
Freeman speculates,

1018
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,840
-"The primary reason there have been so few great women blank

1019
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,200
is not merely that greatness has been undeveloped

1020
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,400
or unrecognized,

1021
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,440
but that women exhibiting potential for achievement

1022
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,160
are punished by both women and men.

1023
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,960
The fear of success is quite rational

1024
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,600
when one knows that the consequence of achievement

1025
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,840
is hostility and not praise."

1026
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,280
So at no point in this essay

1027
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,680
does Joe Freeman use the word envy.

1028
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,960
But as usual, envy is right below the surface,

1029
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,320
causing all the trouble.

1030
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,360
So Freeman is describing

1031
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,680
how people from marginalized groups,

1032
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,800
whose ambition raises them above the typical limits

1033
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,480
set by marginalization,

1034
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,360
are often ostracized from their own communities.

1035
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,720
But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.

1036
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,840
I have an explanation.

1037
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,200
The explanation is envy.

1038
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,160
And women are more likely to envy other women.

1039
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,280
Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.

1040
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

1041
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,200
If we did this topic justice,

1042
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,280
this video would be nine centuries long.

1043
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,800
-"En garde, bitch!"

1044
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,320
A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women,

1045
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,760
and there is some truth to that.

1046
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
There definitely was a time in my life

1047
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,200
when I used to envy cis women for being cis women,

1048
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,120
but now I kind of just don't even allow myself

1049
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,560
to have the thought,

1050
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,240
what if I were a cis woman?

1051
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,160
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible,

1052
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,280
it's unobtainable,

1053
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,840
I actually envy cis women less.

1054
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,440
So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women

1055
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,280
because of the proximity effect,

1056
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,520
and because another trans woman

1057
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,080
represents an actual possibility

1058
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,960
of what I, a trans woman, could become.

1059
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,720
She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.

1060
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,600
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

1061
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,360
Am I the only one who finds it hard

1062
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,800
to watch trans creators?

1063
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,720
Before I realized I was a trans woman,

1064
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,560
I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,

1065
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
Nyx Fears, and other trans creators.

1066
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,320
But ever since I realized I was trans,

1067
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
I just get this angry, resentful feeling

1068
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,280
in the pit of my stomach

1069
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
whenever I get recommended any of these videos.

1070
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,760
I seriously loved ContraPoints,

1071
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,920
but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,

1072
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,520
I just wanna scream.

1073
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,480
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

1074
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,120
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

1075
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,480
Am I just a toxic person?

1076
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,240
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person,

1077
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,400
at least not any worse than anyone else,

1078
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,280
it's just that human nature is a toxic person.

1079
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
And that angry, resentful feeling

1080
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,640
in the pit of your stomach

1081
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
that makes you wanna scream

1082
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,360
and feel such a hatred has a name,

1083
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,440
and the name is Envy.

1084
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,840
I actually admire the person who wrote this post,

1085
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,960
because they're doing the best

1086
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
that any of us can do, really,

1087
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,720
which is noticing the feeling

1088
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,720
without endorsing the feeling.

1089
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,960
I wish that more people could feel things

1090
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,320
without rushing to a rational defense of the feeling.

1091
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,160
And isn't rationality itself

1092
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,520
often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious?

1093
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,320
Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.

1094
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,600
For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual

1095
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
who complains that,

1096
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,240
when I transitioned,

1097
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,040
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping

1098
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,360
but kids these days just waltz on in

1099
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,960
and walk out with hormones.

1100
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,840
It's intergenerational envy, trans edition.

1101
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,040
It was hard for me,

1102
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,040
so it should be hard for everyone,

1103
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
like the student debt debate.

1104
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,760
If I can't have it, no one can.

1105
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,920
And look, I do have sympathy and admiration

1106
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,120
for older trans people.

1107
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,680
Like, being trans in 2021

1108
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,720
is already the maximum level of adversity

1109
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,760
that I can handle.

1110
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,120
I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.

1111
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,800
However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.

1112
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,960
Envy is not sacred rage,

1113
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,600
and the malignant demands of envious people

1114
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,040
should be ignored.

1115
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,240
God, this community.

1116
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,080
The constant competition.

1117
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,000
The envy, the cringing.

1118
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,160
It makes it really hard to get along

1119
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,440
with other trans people.

1120
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,640
Oh, speaking of which.

1121
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
Gay tangent, everybody.

1122
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,680
Gay tangent.

1123
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,240
Envy presents kind of a unique problem

1124
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,080
to same-sex attracted people

1125
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,920
because of the increased risk

1126
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,960
of envying the very people you're attracted to.

1127
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
I want to f*** the ones I envy.

1128
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,920
I envy.

1129
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,280
You know, it's the classic

1130
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,240
do I want you or do I want to be you problem.

1131
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,320
I've heard feminine queer women say

1132
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,240
they could never date another femme

1133
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,360
because they're worried

1134
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,360
they would just end up envying her.

1135
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,240
So dating masculine women solves that problem

1136
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,920
because having separate roles,

1137
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,120
separate aesthetics,

1138
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,560
separate categories

1139
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,240
helps to avert proximity envy between partners.

1140
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,360
Unfortunately, I am not that smart.

1141
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,320
Basically, I am attracted to femininity.

1142
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,760
But I also want to embody

1143
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,840
a kind of feminine archetype myself.

1144
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,720
I'm not masculine and I don't want to be.

1145
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,440
You know, I used to think

1146
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,600
I'd only want to date another trans woman

1147
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,440
because of the mutual understanding.

1148
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,360
But I've kind of realized that at this point

1149
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,520
it may actually be more psychologically healthy

1150
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,440
for me to open up to dating cis women.

1151
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,960
I used to not want to do that

1152
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.

1153
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
But at this point, honestly, just be a man.

1154
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,160
Whatever, it's fine.

1155
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,400
As a drag queen once said,

1156
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be

1157
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,320
and more of a woman than you'll ever have.

1158
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,040
Yes, gawd.

1159
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,680
Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?

1160
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,200
I think at a distance,

1161
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,200
it's okay to indulge the attraction emulation ambiguity.

1162
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,680
But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone,

1163
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,920
you have to make up your mind

1164
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,440
that you desire this woman

1165
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,600
and you do not want to be her.

1166
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,760
Because think about it from the other perspective.

1167
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,680
What could be less attractive

1168
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,240
than someone who literally wants to be you?

1169
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,000
Teacher, make her stop copying me.

1170
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,240
Like as much as I joke every episode

1171
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,200
about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,

1172
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,840
you don't want to date that bitch.

1173
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,040
Imagine trying to date Eve from All About Eve.

1174
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,520
Pass.

1175
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,040
Hard pass.

1176
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,760
So if you're a queer woman or a queer anything, honestly,

1177
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,160
and you find yourself envying your partner,

1178
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,520
my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.

1179
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,160
An enviable woman wanted to be with you.

1180
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,160
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.

1181
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,040
I get it though, it's complicated.

1182
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,880
You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm

1183
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,320
what we truly desire,

1184
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,640
but how do you know what you truly desire?

1185
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,840
Do I want mommy?

1186
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,320
Or do I want to be the mommy?

1187
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,700
Yes.

1188
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,360
Just yes.

1189
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,440
Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

1190
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,280
The mother half took over completely.

1191
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,640
Do I look okay?

1192
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,760
Is my hat on straight?

1193
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,120
So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.

1194
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,000
And people especially cannot seem to notice

1195
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,560
when they themselves are feeling envious.

1196
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,920
Like that person who puzzled over the angry resentful feeling

1197
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,120
in the pit of their stomach

1198
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,600
without being able to name what they were feeling.

1199
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,920
There's two reasons why people are usually in denial

1200
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,120
about their own envy.

1201
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,280
One is guilt, and the other is shame.

1202
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,740
Shame.

1203
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,800
Shame because admitting to yourself that you envy someone

1204
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,520
implies that you feel inferior to them,

1205
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,720
which is shameful.

1206
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,400
It wounds the ego.

1207
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,440
And guilt because envy is malicious.

1208
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,720
If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable

1209
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,880
about their success and good fortune,

1210
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,840
and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.

1211
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,080
That's cruel and antisocial.

1212
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,480
It goes against most ideas of morality,

1213
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,160
and it's a thought that's usually

1214
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
not socially acceptable to admit.

1215
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,040
So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable.

1216
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,720
And we deal with that by suppressing it from our awareness.

1217
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,240
But it is still there.

1218
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
And in order to maintain the denial,

1219
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,160
we have to convince ourselves that this angry resentful feeling

1220
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,680
in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.

1221
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
Think about how in Spongebob,

1222
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,360
Squidward shows contempt for Spongebob's childishness,

1223
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,240
for blowing bubbles, for having fun at work,

1224
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,800
when in fact, Squidward envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy

1225
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,480
and intuitive creativity.

1226
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,960
But he can't allow himself to have the thought

1227
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,720
that he envies Spongebob,

1228
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,640
because that would mean recognizing

1229
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,040
the intolerably shameful truth

1230
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,000
that he feels inferior to Spongebob.

1231
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,240
So what he does instead is convince himself

1232
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,840
that what he really is, is a refined sophisticate,

1233
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,080
scoffing at this childish fool.

1234
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,680
How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors?

1235
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,200
We could call this envy-to-contempt sublimation.

1236
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,080
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term,

1237
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,520
which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling

1238
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,440
or socially unacceptable longing

1239
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,600
into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

1240
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
So the classic example used by Freud

1241
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,560
is the transformation of sexual urges,

1242
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,240
of erotic energy, into creative expression.

1243
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,480
It's like the founder of the NoFap movement,

1244
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,160
Lady Gaga, once said,

1245
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,720
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,

1246
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,040
they're gonna take my creativity from me through my...

1247
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,200
So according to Freud,

1248
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,080
the vast majority of erotic longings

1249
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,600
can never be fulfilled.

1250
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,960
Tell me about a segment...

1251
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,480
Ugh, misery.

1252
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,680
But there's a positive side to this, supposedly,

1253
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,720
which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings

1254
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,520
into a more socially acceptable productivity.

1255
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,840
So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,

1256
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,280
maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires,

1257
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,680
or for that matter, philosophical treatises

1258
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,880
about the will to power.

1259
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,400
Oh, we'll get to you.

1260
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,640
Freud thought that civilization itself

1261
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,800
is built at the cost of our instincts,

1262
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
most of which we have to sacrifice

1263
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,640
in order to live in a society.

1264
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,560
So like erotic impulses,

1265
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,720
I think envy can be sublimated,

1266
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,520
which is what's happening when it becomes contempt.

1267
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,480
Another example is the blog McMansion Hell,

1268
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,800
which makes fun of the tasteless architecture

1269
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,200
of suburban ostentatious trash.

1270
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog

1271
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,200
is the pleasure and relief of looking down at the rich.

1272
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,760
Because looking enviously up at the rich

1273
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,800
is painful, it makes you feel inferior.

1274
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
And a way to alleviate that pain

1275
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,360
is to sublimate envy and pretend

1276
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,840
that you're an aristocratic aesthete

1277
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,440
scoffing at the vulgar taste of the era of East.

1278
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,520
These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.

1279
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,800
Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.

1280
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,320
I once heard a trans woman say,

1281
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,360
at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.

1282
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,400
The subtext is,

1283
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,640
there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer

1284
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,520
who lives in LA and has a lot of cosmetic surgery

1285
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,680
to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

1286
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,080
But it costs a lot of money to look like this.

1287
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,160
And a lot of trans women can't afford

1288
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,760
surgeries that they want.

1289
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,920
And one way to cope with frustrated desire

1290
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,240
is to convince yourself that the thing

1291
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,760
that's out of reach is not worth having anyway.

1292
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,680
See also the discourse on Twitter

1293
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,760
about how passing is transphobic.

1294
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,200
There's an ancient Greek fable

1295
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,800
where a fox wants some grapes,

1296
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,400
but he can't reach the vine.

1297
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
So he walks away bitterly and says,

1298
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,720
well the grapes are transphobic anyway.

1299
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
The cisgender version of this is maybe

1300
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
the not-like-other-girls meme,

1301
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,360
which is classic envy-to-contempt sublimation.

1302
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,080
The trope is usually that other girls

1303
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,600
are popular and slutty.

1304
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,920
They have fake tans and fake nails.

1305
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,680
They like partying and makeup

1306
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,000
and stupid music for idiots.

1307
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,760
But I'm quirky and real.

1308
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,720
I listen to Pink Floyd and read books

1309
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,280
and eat lots of pizza late at night,

1310
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,120
alone and sad.

1311
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
There's usually a subtext of anxiety

1312
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,800
about inferiority,

1313
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,600
the other girls being more socially accepted,

1314
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,200
feminine, and put together.

1315
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,280
A lot of times the other girls

1316
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,800
don't even exist, right?

1317
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,600
They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.

1318
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,200
Like where are these other girls

1319
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,800
who've never eaten pizza

1320
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,760
and enjoy wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?

1321
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,680
Are they between the sofa cushions?

1322
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,760
Did you put them in with the other laundry?

1323
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,000
Are the other girls in the room with us right now?

1324
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,680
So the feeling of inferiority

1325
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,120
toward the other girls

1326
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,520
is reframed as a kind of contemptuous

1327
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,040
hipster superiority,

1328
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,120
which is really just an ego-defensive

1329
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,640
persona of resentment.

1330
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,320
Like Janice in Mean Girls.

1331
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,680
She's not even really a lesbian.

1332
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,880
She's Lebanese.

1333
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,920
Lebanese.

1334
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,440
Regina got confused.

1335
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,280
And then she dances with a boy at the end

1336
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,280
and is readmitted into girlhood.

1337
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,720
Uh, thank you for that Tina Fey,

1338
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,600
that's very helpful.

1339
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,200
Great.

1340
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,880
Another way we can reframe

1341
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,200
feelings of envious inferiority

1342
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,960
is by transforming them into moral superiority.

1343
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,000
Moral superiority often being the refuge

1344
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,640
of people with nothing better to feel superior about.

1345
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,760
We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy

1346
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,120
if we convince ourselves

1347
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,360
that what we're actually experiencing

1348
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,400
is justified, legitimate hatred.

1349
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,600
So for example,

1350
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,320
think of the morality around sexuality.

1351
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,920
Part 69.

1352
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,560
Sluts.

1353
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,240
Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

1354
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,880
Cancel me?

1355
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,160
En garde!

1356
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,320
Bitch!

1357
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,480
Why does everyone hate sluts so much?

1358
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,640
Sluts never did nothing wrong to nobody.

1359
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,120
Open sexual promiscuity is in a way

1360
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,880
analogous to opulence.

1361
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,120
You're conspicuously enjoying something

1362
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,480
that other people want but may not be able to get.

1363
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,040
Many cultures have norms about modesty,

1364
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,480
for example expecting women

1365
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,240
to cover their hair in public.

1366
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,000
This is usually explained as

1367
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,240
prophylaxis against male lust,

1368
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,840
but I wonder if it also serves

1369
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,640
to prevent a more generalized envy,

1370
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,520
which female beauty has a way of attracting.

1371
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,360
Men often slut shame

1372
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,840
because they want to control female sexuality.

1373
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,840
And by female sexuality,

1374
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,920
I do mean male sexuality,

1375
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,640
because often what they're really struggling to control

1376
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,080
is their own desire.

1377
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,080
But slut shaming is also done

1378
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,800
pretty viciously by women to each other.

1379
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,560
And that's a complicated thing.

1380
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,920
It's more than just envy.

1381
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,280
Sometimes it comes from a sense

1382
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,720
that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men

1383
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,720
is compromising the collective

1384
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,040
sex-withholding power of the group,

1385
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
almost like she's crossing a picket line.

1386
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,440
But there's also sometimes a resentment

1387
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,760
that a woman who's showing skin

1388
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,440
is using her body to get unearned attention.

1389
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,600
And that smells like envy to me.

1390
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,840
I don't use my body to get attention,

1391
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,000
so no one should.

1392
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
The repressed feeling is

1393
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,040
maybe I'm a little jealous

1394
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,720
that she's getting all this attention

1395
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,240
by posting thirst traps,

1396
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,920
but you don't think that.

1397
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,880
You think,

1398
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
I am above this

1399
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,120
because I am chaste.

1400
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,880
I have class.

1401
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,960
I am a feminist.

1402
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,400
I would also suggest accusing her

1403
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,480
of pandering to the male gaze.

1404
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,080
That's, of course, the feminist way

1405
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,440
of calling someone a low-down hobag skank.

1406
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,400
So again, we have envy to contempt sublimation,

1407
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,240
and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.

1408
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,520
The psychological need to convince ourselves

1409
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,440
that envy is morality can become so strong

1410
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
that we actually start inventing things

1411
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,200
to be outraged about.

1412
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,840
Take, for instance, the tendency to imagine

1413
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,280
that the wealthy and powerful

1414
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,240
are enjoying wild satanic orgies

1415
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,440
and indulging all the forbidden salacious pleasures

1416
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,520
that we ourselves are denied.

1417
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,560
Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists

1418
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,720
who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton

1419
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,600
reclining in a garden of earthly delights,

1420
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,360
sampling the pleasures of Ephibes.

1421
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,640
Live, laugh, love that for her.

1422
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,960
Envy is very imaginative when it comes

1423
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,000
to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

1424
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,

1425
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,880
the queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.

1426
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,520
If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette,

1427
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,680
it's probably that when she heard about a famine

1428
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,440
where the people had no bread,

1429
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,880
she infamously responded,

1430
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,880
let them eat cake.

1431
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,440
What an evil bitch.

1432
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,120
How could she say that?

1433
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,240
Well, she didn't.

1434
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,520
She never said it.

1435
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,560
It's a lie.

1436
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,480
The phrase let them eat cake,

1437
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,560
originally let them eat brioche,

1438
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,800
first appeared in Rousseau's Confessions,

1439
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,360
written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.

1440
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,120
Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.

1441
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,600
Probably no one ever said this.

1442
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
It's kind of like how the most famous photo

1443
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,240
of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing

1444
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,720
a Stop Being Poor t-shirt.

1445
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,320
What an evil bitch.

1446
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,000
How could she wear that?

1447
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Well, she didn't.

1448
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,360
It's photoshopped.

1449
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,560
The actual shirt said Stop Being Desperate.

1450
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,000
Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes

1451
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,040
of its enemies.

1452
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,000
I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

1453
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,520
I mean, what is a Disney villain

1454
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,440
if not an opulent homosexual

1455
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,280
seen through the eyes of the envious?

1456
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,640
See how I do it?

1457
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,080
I'm gonna try lowering the ISO

1458
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,680
because it's so f***ing bright in here now.

1459
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,640
Okay, well it's a much lower ISO.

1460
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,240
What if I get another white over here?

1461
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,600
That's what this channel is really about,

1462
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,520
one biological female's quest

1463
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,920
to create a harmonious color story.

1464
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,280
In the years leading up to

1465
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,280
and during the French Revolution,

1466
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,080
Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed

1467
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,360
in these sleazy tabloids called libelles.

1468
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,600
It's the same root as the English word libel.

1469
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,640
The often pornographic libelles depicted the queen

1470
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,320
as a bisexual demon

1471
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,560
who was constantly having drunken orgies

1472
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,960
and sexually manipulating everyone around her.

1473
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,200
All of which is very interesting,

1474
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,360
but none of which is true.

1475
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,680
The historian Robert Darnton called it

1476
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,760
an avalanche of defamation

1477
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,200
that has no parallel in the history of vilification.

1478
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,360
This woman took the blame,

1479
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,040
the moral blame,

1480
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,720
for the structural failings of a broken economic system.

1481
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,000
And by the time she was brought

1482
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,360
before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793,

1483
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,600
the actual person Marie Antoinette

1484
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,680
had long ago been overshadowed

1485
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,760
by the libellous caricature of her.

1486
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,240
Now there was maybe one good reason

1487
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,080
for executing the former queen,

1488
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,120
which is that the legitimacy of your new republic

1489
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,800
is a little more secure

1490
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,000
when you don't have living monarchs hanging around.

1491
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,520
Someone better tell the English.

1492
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,280
But the problem with that reasoning

1493
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,960
is it has nothing to do

1494
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,240
with whether or not the queen deserved to die.

1495
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,960
And beheading a recently widowed mother of two

1496
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,080
in front of a jeering crowd for political expediency

1497
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,120
might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.

1498
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,360
So the Revolution had to convince themselves

1499
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,600
that the queen deserved it,

1500
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,920
which was pretty easy after decades of,

1501
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,800
again, false and defamatory gossip.

1502
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,120
In her biography of Marie Antoinette,

1503
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,200
Antonia Fraser describes

1504
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,520
how the prison guards separated Marie

1505
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,120
from her eight-year-old son,

1506
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,960
who they plied with alcohol

1507
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,760
and groomed into accusing his own mother

1508
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,520
of incestuous abuse.

1509
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,480
To justify killing Marie Antoinette,

1510
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,640
they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a mother.

1511
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,360
So she was convicted of what may as well have been

1512
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,160
crimes against ethics in games journalism,

1513
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,680
and sent to the guillotine,

1514
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,200
where her last words were

1515
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,560
sorry to the executioner for stepping on his foot.

1516
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,800
A women-stop-apologizing challenge.

1517
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,120
This is what a girlboss winning looks like.

1518
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,880
So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.

1519
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,440
Hey, how are you?

1520
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,480
An innocent milf was killed that day,

1521
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,200
and I, for one, won't stand for it.

1522
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,600
So look, we have a psychological incentive

1523
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,760
to believe that people whom we envy are immoral monsters,

1524
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,480
because then we get to label our hatred and violence

1525
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,160
toward them justice.

1526
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,800
Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty,

1527
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,640
and part of the reason for that

1528
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,720
is that calling cruelty what it is

1529
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,040
takes the fun out of it.

1530
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,520
It reminds me of the second best day

1531
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,200
in the history of Twitter,

1532
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,120
October 1st, 2020,

1533
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,360
the day that Trump got COVID.

1534
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,800
And I'm gonna be honest,

1535
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,400
I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.

1536
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,120
Well, well, well.

1537
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,920
If it isn't the leopards-eating-people's-faces party

1538
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,000
having their faces eaten by leopards.

1539
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,040
It's the last time I eat cake.

1540
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,400
Like Dan Savage said,

1541
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,720
it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

1542
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,080
The next day, I tweeted,

1543
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,000
these last 24 hours have been the first time

1544
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,320
I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years,

1545
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,720
because this website is good for one thing only,

1546
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,280
reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.

1547
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,200
And someone responded to that saying,

1548
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,560
oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?

1549
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,320
But why was I being a killjoy?

1550
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,120
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

1551
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,960
Well, for most people,

1552
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,920
I guess not me,

1553
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,600
but for normal people,

1554
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,800
for other girls,

1555
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,400
cruelty is only pleasurable

1556
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,160
as long as they can convince themselves

1557
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,240
it's something other than cruelty.

1558
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,760
Justice served.

1559
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,720
So again, reason, rationality,

1560
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,840
are often the attempt to publicly communicate,

1561
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,800
to evangelize our private feelings.

1562
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,920
And morality, ethics, and justice

1563
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,520
are often put forward

1564
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,240
as the respectable public face

1565
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,400
of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.

1566
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,440
But is this a corruption of morality?

1567
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,240
Or have we stumbled onto something darker?

1568
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,400
What if morality itself

1569
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,480
is simply the expression

1570
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,040
of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?

1571
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,680
It's too early for this.

1572
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,320
I mean, it's literally 7 a.m. where I'm filming.

1573
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know how this keeps happening to me.

1574
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,920
My head gets cut off one afternoon.

1575
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,080
Puts me in a philosophical mood.

1576
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,320
Next morning, I've stayed up all night

1577
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,160
and I'm still talking about the philosophes.

1578
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,680
Meow meow.

1579
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,040
Hello again, kittens.

1580
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,960
Let's talk about justice, uwu.

1581
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,440
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

1582
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,560
Sonia?

1583
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,840
Soda meow your?

1584
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,320
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know,

1585
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,920
if I wasn't being Natalie.

1586
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,720
Look, I've been seeing a lot of comments lately

1587
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,760
along the lines of,

1588
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,040
Natalie used to do serious academic arguments.

1589
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,880
Now she only cares about makeup.

1590
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,120
All right, you little shits.

1591
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,640
You want book learning?

1592
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm gonna learn you so hard.

1593
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,200
I'm gonna learn you so hard

1594
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,880
you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.

1595
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,240
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1596
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,560
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche.

1597
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,000
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

1598
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Friedrich was a German philosopher

1599
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,040
who had a lot to say about envy and morality.

1600
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,080
But before we get into that,

1601
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,920
I want to say a little bit about his life,

1602
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,000
because it's just very funny.

1603
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,720
Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch,

1604
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,640
but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful little Friedrich,

1605
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,840
he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

1606
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,080
Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain,

1607
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,760
nearly blind incel,

1608
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,760
who probably slept with a prostitute once

1609
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,160
and got syphilis and died.

1610
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,160
Life is funny.

1611
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,520
Sad, but funny.

1612
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,560
In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil,

1613
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,920
the editor says,

1614
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,480
though he prided himself on being comfortable with women,

1615
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,400
he does not seem to have been very successful

1616
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,440
in establishing emotionally satisfying relationships with them,

1617
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,880
which is hardly surprising.

1618
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,840
Ah!

1619
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,200
I love when the introduction to a book

1620
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,360
is just a brutal roast of the author.

1621
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,240
Who wrote this?

1622
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,760
Rolf Peter Horstmann.

1623
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,880
You're killing it, Rolf.

1624
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,840
You're savage.

1625
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,640
I adore.

1626
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,720
Friedrich's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.

1627
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,680
What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated,

1628
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,400
highly neurotic man who had to try hard

1629
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,040
to avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.

1630
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,080
Oh.

1631
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,640
He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable,

1632
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,120
and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping pills

1633
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,120
using the name Dr. Nietzsche.

1634
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,800
Dr. Nietzsche?

1635
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,200
Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once.

1636
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,120
Behind a Dairy Queen.

1637
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,800
Nietzsche was also a failed musician,

1638
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,600
and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's wife.

1639
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,760
The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.

1640
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,720
You beta cuck.

1641
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,120
Why did I do that?

1642
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,360
Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche

1643
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,360
is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

1644
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,360
I just wanna mom this guy, honestly.

1645
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,280
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

1646
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,960
His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.

1647
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,320
You know, I think it's interesting

1648
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,240
that a person this pathetic

1649
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,040
can also be a genius whose name will never die.

1650
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,720
He's someone who had a lot of reason

1651
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,560
to be envious and self-pitying,

1652
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,600
but his philosophy couldn't be more against that.

1653
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,160
And as a person of pathetic experience myself,

1654
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,720
that is unironically kind of inspiring to me.

1655
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,160
So let's go in.

1656
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,040
In his book on the genealogy of morality,

1657
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,440
Frederick wants to explain the origin

1658
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,520
of the concepts of good and evil.

1659
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
Under what conditions did man invent

1660
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,200
the value judgments good and evil,

1661
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,600
and what value do they themselves have?

1662
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,800
Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?

1663
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,080
Hang on, my food's here.

1664
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,240
That's right, you're getting a mukbang, sweetie.

1665
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,080
Did you think I was gonna sit at this giant table

1666
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,280
and not be eating something?

1667
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:16,880
This video's been going on more than an hour,

1668
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,640
so I assume you guys are drunk by now,

1669
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,800
and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.

1670
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,000
You guys can't even see.

1671
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,400
Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi,

1672
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,000
and it's my mission to eat all of this

1673
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,760
while summarizing the entire life

1674
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,200
and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

1675
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,400
Trisha Paytas, Nicocado, consider this a challenge.

1676
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,280
So Frederick argues that good and bad,

1677
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,520
not good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,

1678
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,840
but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values

1679
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,280
of people with power.

1680
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,680
So to be good meant to be powerful,

1681
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,920
strong, beautiful, healthy,

1682
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,120
and to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.

1683
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,240
I'm gonna eat one like a cat.

1684
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,960
And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.

1685
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,160
So in a lot of languages,

1686
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,120
the word that means morally good or spiritually noble

1687
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,880
originally meant noble in the sense of aristocratic,

1688
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,160
the propertied class.

1689
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,280
Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani,

1690
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,520
that's Sanskrit for noble truths.

1691
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,440
Arya means noble.

1692
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,320
And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble,

1693
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,440
but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the rich.

1694
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,800
And originally, it was just the name

1695
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,560
that a culture in Northern India gave themselves, the Aryans.

1696
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,440
I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.

1697
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,240
This was later misunderstood by Europeans

1698
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,200
who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.

1699
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,960
Oops, goddammit.

1700
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,360
Goddammit, kids, can we not?

1701
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,560
Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut,

1702
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,600
or the English good, to the name of the Goths.

1703
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,200
No, not those Goths,

1704
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,680
the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

1705
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,800
Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.

1706
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,080
I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.

1707
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,680
The German word schlecht, which means bad,

1708
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,400
is related to schlicht, which means plain,

1709
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,360
simple, originally common, low,

1710
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,000
not aristocratic, not noble.

1711
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,880
So good and bad were originally the values

1712
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,400
of warrior aristocrats,

1713
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,000
who were like Homeric heroes celebrating themselves.

1714
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,760
And Frederick calls their value system master morality,

1715
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,960
this glorification of combat, feasting,

1716
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,720
athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty.

1717
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,400
These things were called good,

1718
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,840
and their opposites, weakness, impotence,

1719
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,840
ugliness, were called bad.

1720
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,240
The ancient nobles worshiped noble gods

1721
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,560
who acted like them and shared their values.

1722
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
I mean, if I created a personal goddess,

1723
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,560
I think we all know what animal that would be,

1724
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,960
me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.

1725
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,320
So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars,

1726
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,440
the god of war,

1727
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,600
and it was like they were worshiping themselves.

1728
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,400
They were dumb jocks worshiping dumb jock gods.

1729
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,520
Well, good for them,

1730
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,800
but what about the people who got shoved into lockers?

1731
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
Well, Frederick's example,

1732
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,520
and this is gonna create some misunderstandings later,

1733
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,400
but his example is the Jews,

1734
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,200
who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.

1735
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,480
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.

1736
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,520
Oh, they did, multiple times.

1737
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,720
But for several centuries,

1738
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,640
the Romans were just too powerful.

1739
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,840
No one could stop them.

1740
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,120
So the question is,

1741
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,640
what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed

1742
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,360
and who lack the power to overthrow the oppressor?

1743
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,360
Well, in that case,

1744
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,160
frustrated vindictiveness builds over time

1745
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,160
to become this deep bitterness,

1746
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,160
which Nietzsche gave the French name

1747
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,800
Résentiment, resentment in English.

1748
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,600
Oui, eh, eh, oui, absolument, naturellement.

1749
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,720
I don't speak French,

1750
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,960
I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.

1751
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,720
M'en, pas, quatre, eh, eh oui.

1752
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,520
I don't like the English,

1753
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,960
but I like the French even less.

1754
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,240
Because they're always dressed so well

1755
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,240
and they speak a sexier language than me.

1756
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:58,880
Stop it.

1757
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,640
This is your final warning, comprendez-vous?

1758
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,080
Good wine though, I'll give them that.

1759
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,600
So there's a German word, Neid, which means envy.

1760
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,360
So why is Frederick using this French term, Résentiment?

1761
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,800
What's going on, Frederick?

1762
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,920
Why are you speaking French?

1763
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,520
Are you nervous?

1764
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,880
Are you trying to impress me?

1765
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
Nietzsche must have said Résentiment,

1766
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,440
because he thought it was something different than envy.

1767
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,440
I think the difference is resentment,

1768
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,640
and I'm just gonna use the English word

1769
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,000
so I don't sound like an asshole,

1770
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,160
resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has,

1771
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,320
but of a permanent frustration of the desire for revenge.

1772
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,000
It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.

1773
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,960
Now revenge itself implies weakness,

1774
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,720
at least a temporary weakness.

1775
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,440
We say revenge is best served cold,

1776
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,640
but actually, revenge is only served cold.

1777
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,760
If it's served hot, if someone slaps you

1778
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,440
and you slap them back immediately,

1779
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,920
that's retaliation, not revenge.

1780
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,720
You brought this on yourself.

1781
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,480
Revenge is only a possibility

1782
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,800
when you can't retaliate immediately,

1783
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,000
so you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming.

1784
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,560
But if you're too weak, too impotent

1785
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,160
to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.

1786
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,920
So Nietzsche's argument is that a person

1787
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,560
who's too weak to get material revenge

1788
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,600
can instead get psychological revenge

1789
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,840
by creating a new morality.

1790
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,040
In Frederick's words,

1791
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,320
the beginning of the slave's revolt and morality

1792
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,520
occurs when resentment itself turns creative

1793
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,280
and gives birth to values.

1794
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,760
This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?

1795
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,800
What are you doing, Frederick?

1796
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,520
So while master morality says that good

1797
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,320
is power, riches, health, and strength,

1798
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
and bad is the opposite,

1799
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,040
slave morality, the morality of resentment,

1800
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,000
says blessed are the poor, the meek,

1801
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,080
the sick, the powerless.

1802
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,640
This is the good of slave morality,

1803
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,480
and its opposite is not the bad,

1804
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,040
but a new concept, the evil.

1805
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,320
And what is evil?

1806
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,360
Well, everything that master morality says is good.

1807
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,240
Power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.

1808
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,320
He's talking about Christianity here,

1809
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,240
he's not talking about Judaism.

1810
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,080
But Frederick thinks of Christianity

1811
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,080
as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the Romans,

1812
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,640
an inversion of the empire's values.

1813
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,640
But he also thinks that slave morality

1814
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,720
is fundamentally dishonest.

1815
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,720
It's like the fox and the grapes.

1816
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,960
Not being able to take revenge

1817
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,920
is called not wanting to take revenge.

1818
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,400
It might even be called forgiveness.

1819
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,320
Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.

1820
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,080
Submission to people you hate is called obedience.

1821
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,360
Having to wait is called patience.

1822
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,520
Inability to satisfy sexual desire

1823
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,200
is called chastity, purity, and so on.

1824
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,960
And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself

1825
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,240
as a powerful, noble beast of prey,

1826
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,480
slave morality is born of saying no to the master

1827
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,640
and everything he has that you can't.

1828
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,800
I like to have my belly rubbed.

1829
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,280
Scratch my back above my tail, please.

1830
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,560
I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away

1831
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,320
because it's getting warm and I'm full.

1832
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,080
This has not been a successful mukbang.

1833
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,920
It turns out that it's actually very difficult

1834
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,920
to do a mukbang while talking.

1835
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,520
I should've thought this through a little harder, hmm.

1836
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,960
So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge,

1837
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,920
but that desire for revenge never completely disappears.

1838
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,040
It's there, for example,

1839
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,360
in the Christian idea of the last judgment.

1840
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,200
No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.

1841
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,640
God will do that for us.

1842
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,200
And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.

1843
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,800
I find this book thrilling to read, honestly,

1844
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,480
and I'm not easily thrilled,

1845
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,640
especially not by philosophers.

1846
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,240
I think this book in particular gets me

1847
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,880
because, especially if you were raised Christian,

1848
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,440
this is so the opposite of everything

1849
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,640
you were ever taught to believe

1850
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,440
that it almost feels, like, dirty.

1851
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,640
Should I be reading this?

1852
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,920
Is this allowed?

1853
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,120
Because even if you're not religious,

1854
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,560
most of us still agree with a lot of Christian morality.

1855
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,240
Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.

1856
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,960
Blessed are the meek, sure.

1857
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,120
But then Frederick comes along and he's like,

1858
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,280
mm, morality is just a cope for frustrated vindictiveness.

1859
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,360
And you're like, I need to lie down.

1860
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,640
Where's my smelling salts?

1861
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:33,680
But wait, there's more.

1862
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,040
This gets even darker.

1863
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,960
Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia

1864
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,560
of European history, slave morality has triumphed.

1865
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,200
St. Paul made Christianity marketable,

1866
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,520
the Emperor Constantine converted,

1867
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,120
and by the Middle Ages,

1868
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,840
even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down

1869
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,120
not to powerful warrior gods made in their own image,

1870
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,880
but to a god that was weak,

1871
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,040
suffering, victimized, oppressed.

1872
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,080
So by the 19th century,

1873
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,360
slave morality had become the only morality.

1874
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,440
And it's not just Christianity, either.

1875
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,600
The secular version of these values

1876
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,000
became socialism, anarchism.

1877
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,560
About free thinkers and atheists,

1878
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,160
Nietzsche has this to say.

1879
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,720
We loathe the church, not its poison.

1880
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,000
Apart from the church, we too love the poison.

1881
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,280
Okay, the poison.

1882
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,360
What is the poison?

1883
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,440
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind,

1884
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,640
and turns humans against our own natural instincts.

1885
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,080
Not just against aggression,

1886
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,080
but against sexuality,

1887
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,360
against ambition,

1888
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,720
against power,

1889
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,480
against life itself.

1890
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,560
And there's two possible outcomes of this.

1891
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,160
One is that resentment becomes a political movement,

1892
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,560
the conspiracy of those who suffer,

1893
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,320
the tyranny of the herd,

1894
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,720
the revolution that eats itself.

1895
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,440
Only we are good and just, is what they say.

1896
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,160
As though health, success, strength, pride,

1897
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,360
and the feeling of power were in themselves depravities

1898
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,120
for which penance, bitter penance,

1899
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,720
will one day be exacted.

1900
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,520
Among them, we find plenty of vengeance seekers

1901
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,200
disguised as judges,

1902
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,440
with the word justice continually in their mouth

1903
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,040
like poisonous spittle.

1904
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,720
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob,

1905
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,480
which I'm sure we're all familiar with.

1906
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,160
The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward,

1907
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,560
and attacks the individual conscience,

1908
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,480
producing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.

1909
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,240
Because slave morality condemns

1910
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:33,840
not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing us,

1911
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,040
but also the beast of prey within,

1912
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,880
our own animal instincts,

1913
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,960
what Christianity calls sin.

1914
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,440
So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.

1915
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,160
We hate ourselves, we hate our own nature,

1916
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,640
we hate life itself.

1917
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,720
I mean, is he wrong?

1918
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,160
You see a girl boss winning,

1919
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,800
I only see the will to power.

1920
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,200
Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats

1921
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,920
who've become domesticated house pets,

1922
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,120
at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.

1923
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,880
That's very valid, Frederick.

1924
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,800
That's super hecking valid.

1925
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,600
So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far,

1926
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,840
but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.

1927
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,280
One is that Frederick associating slave morality

1928
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,000
with the Jews is very irresponsible.

1929
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,240
Even though he didn't intend to be antisemitic,

1930
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,720
and even though he was outspoken against antisemitism

1931
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,600
in his own time,

1932
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,000
when you keep referring to the Christian values

1933
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,760
you're critiquing as Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge,

1934
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,480
some people might get the wrong idea.

1935
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,080
And some people did, Frederick.

1936
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,560
Like your dumbass sister, Elizabeth Nietzsche,

1937
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,040
who became a literal alternative ethno-identitarian.

1938
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,160
God damn it, Liz.

1939
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,760
Kind of goth goals, though.

1940
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,280
Yes, that kind of goth.

1941
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,240
You're right this time.

1942
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,480
My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred

1943
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,760
to Frederick that genuinely caring about other people

1944
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,720
is an option.

1945
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,560
Like not because caring about other people

1946
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,040
is repressing your true selfish nature,

1947
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,280
but just because caring about other people

1948
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,880
is part of your nature.

1949
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,000
And isn't it?

1950
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,960
Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?

1951
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,920
I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment

1952
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,720
accurately describes a very real thing.

1953
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,560
But it's not the only thing.

1954
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,440
There is genuine care and love in this world,

1955
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,320
I've been told.

1956
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,440
I've heard rumors.

1957
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,200
And I'm even gonna go so far as to say

1958
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,120
hashtag not all Christians.

1959
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,720
Christ, I'm defending the Christians.

1960
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,240
What is this channel coming to?

1961
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,720
There are Christians, maybe not most,

1962
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,080
but still some, for whom love and forgiveness

1963
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,000
are genuine experiences,

1964
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,640
and not just some kind of twisted,

1965
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,360
impotent, passive-aggressive vengeance.

1966
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,920
Where I agree with Nietzsche, and with Freud,

1967
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,720
is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation

1968
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,560
of justice and morality is retribution,

1969
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,840
envy, or some combination of the two.

1970
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,000
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

1971
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,920
There's a famous Martin Luther King quote

1972
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,440
responding to Nietzsche.

1973
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,680
What is needed is a realization

1974
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,080
that power without love is reckless and abusive,

1975
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,520
and that love without power is sentimental and anemic.

1976
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,720
Power at its best is love

1977
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,320
implementing the demands of justice,

1978
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,720
and justice at its best is love correcting everything

1979
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,320
that stands against love.

1980
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,000
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche

1981
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,800
that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.

1982
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,040
But there still needs to be some kind of emotional

1983
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,440
or spiritual force that keeps humanity

1984
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,120
from tearing itself apart.

1985
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,760
And maybe something like this Christian idea

1986
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,160
of love for humanity is the missing piece.

1987
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,000
Because without something like that,

1988
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,440
I just see retribution and envy snowballing

1989
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,280
into human self-destruction.

1990
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,720
And I hate that for us.

1991
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,320
It's not very sliving of us.

1992
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,600
Do you guys know about sliving?

1993
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,160
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?

1994
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,000
She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do,

1995
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,720
but you know, I try to support smaller creators.

1996
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:08,240
Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life

1997
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,040
into one word.

1998
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,000
It's the new that's hot.

1999
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,160
Maybe I'll do a video about love

2000
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,680
when I'm in a better mood.

2001
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,960
So for now, well, let's put it this way.

2002
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,240
God is dead, and we have killed him, yeah?

2003
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:21,760
Sliving!

2004
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,320
Sliving!

2005
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,040
Okay, I'm moisturized.

2006
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,920
I'm primed.

2007
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,000
I've proven my academic credentials.

2008
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,520
Now it's time to do my makeup.

2009
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,480
That's right, children.

2010
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,320
I'm going full Bailey Sarian.

2011
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,720
I'm going full suspish.

2012
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,080
So I guess I should say something

2013
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,320
about the political implications of all this,

2014
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,120
since I guess this channel is about politics.

2015
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,440
Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article

2016
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,280
to remember what I'm doing with my life.

2017
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,520
So this morality of resentment,

2018
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,720
of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge

2019
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,240
judges that power is evil.

2020
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,200
I don't use foundation.

2021
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,400
I just use concealer.

2022
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,480
I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup,

2023
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,080
but I don't need to be good at makeup, okay?

2024
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,160
I have a million subscribers on YouTube.

2025
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,680
I don't need to be good.

2026
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,960
There was a New York Times article

2027
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,760
about young women's attitudes toward political ambition,

2028
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,760
and one of the women who was interviewed said,

2029
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,200
as a white woman, I know I have unearned privilege.

2030
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,240
So am I really the best person to be in leadership?

2031
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,840
Uh, yes.

2032
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,560
Yes, you are.

2033
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,400
Because we need leaders like you

2034
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,240
who are capable of questioning

2035
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,320
the legitimacy of their own authority.

2036
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,160
Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck

2037
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,160
with another blonde beast of prey.

2038
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,120
And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege,

2039
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,480
especially as a leader,

2040
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,640
but let's not be so self-effacing

2041
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,360
that we efface ourselves off the face of the earth.

2042
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,880
This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.

2043
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,800
If you think power is evil,

2044
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,920
then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,

2045
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,960
which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance,

2046
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,640
since, like MLK said,

2047
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,800
you have to at least have some power

2048
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,040
to implement the demands of justice.

2049
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,080
Remember what incels call taking the black pill,

2050
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,800
this conviction that the reason you don't have a girlfriend

2051
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,200
is just that you're genetically undesirable.

2052
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,880
There's nothing you can do to change it,

2053
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,440
and I guess women are just too shallow

2054
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,080
to be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite

2055
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,760
that festers in your heart.

2056
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,520
For a lot of black-pilled incels,

2057
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,760
it seems like there's only one thing left in life

2058
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,720
that they enjoy,

2059
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,000
which is simply the pleasure of complaining,

2060
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,760
of moaning in pain.

2061
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,960
It reminds me of a comment from Dostoevsky's

2062
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,640
second most horrible protagonist.

2063
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:57,680
The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain,

2064
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,320
and part of the satisfaction of moaning

2065
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,120
is inflicting your pain on other people.

2066
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,040
This kind of malignant moaning,

2067
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,680
it's kind of the opposite of music,

2068
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,000
because a lot of music, like blues,

2069
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,840
is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.

2070
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,360
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

2071
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,800
My woman don't love me no more,

2072
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,240
but I know her sister will.

2073
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,840
You know, optimism.

2074
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,520
I think a lot of incel discourse

2075
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,920
is really just malignant moaning, right?

2076
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,280
It's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem.

2077
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,760
It's just a contagious expression of misery,

2078
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,680
a moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.

2079
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,760
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

2080
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,760
The redistribution of sex.

2081
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,840
State-mandated GFs.

2082
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,760
That's very valid.

2083
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,240
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.

2084
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,320
That's not the point.

2085
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,680
So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.

2086
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,320
It's very easy to point and laugh at them,

2087
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,720
but what's harder is to look in the mirror

2088
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,440
and notice how these exact same tendencies

2089
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,520
are rampant in our own communities.

2090
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,000
So the incel black pill is just one instance

2091
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,800
of what I call an ideology of resentment,

2092
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,800
a discourse that outwardly appears

2093
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,640
like moral or political critique,

2094
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,560
but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.

2095
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,320
The goal of resentment politics

2096
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,400
is not to improve conditions.

2097
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,000
In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt

2098
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,200
for any morally compromised sellouts

2099
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,840
who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.

2100
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,360
They don't want victory.

2101
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,560
They don't want power.

2102
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,360
They want to endlessly critique power.

2103
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,000
Because for them, critique is an important

2104
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,560
psychological defense against feeling impotent.

2105
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,240
Schaler described it this way.

2106
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,800
It is peculiar to resentment criticism

2107
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,400
that it does not seriously desire

2108
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,000
that its demands be fulfilled.

2109
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,600
It does not want to cure the evil.

2110
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,320
The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.

2111
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,920
What am I going to do with my eyes?

2112
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,840
I think a pink kind of look.

2113
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,280
We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

2114
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,280
I just, I love that hay fever look.

2115
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,720
As a general rule,

2116
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,000
the more radical a political community claims to be,

2117
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,280
the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.

2118
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,200
Self-styled radicals will tell you

2119
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,400
superficial surface reforms do not interest us.

2120
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,120
The problem must be critiqued at its root.

2121
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,920
And then the root turns out to be this universal,

2122
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,000
all-encompassing evil, right?

2123
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,520
Society itself.

2124
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,480
The system.

2125
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,520
The machine.

2126
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,320
A resentment ideologue always imagines himself

2127
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,440
to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt

2128
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,880
against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.

2129
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.

2130
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,640
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

2131
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,000
It's hard to talk while doing this.

2132
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,320
And nothing short of total revolution

2133
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,560
counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.

2134
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,880
We have to dismantle the entire system.

2135
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,880
Burn it all down.

2136
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,960
I guess it's pedestrian to point out

2137
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,760
that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent

2138
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,840
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

2139
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,840
Our kingdom is coming, comrades.

2140
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,480
Often the appeal of utopian ideology

2141
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,920
is similar to religion.

2142
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,200
It's not about healthcare, higher wages,

2143
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,360
relief from police violence.

2144
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,240
Those are actual goals that could be demanded,

2145
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,760
worked for, and achieved.

2146
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,040
Utopian ideology instead promises relief

2147
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,360
from some general malaise, alienation.

2148
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,560
And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect

2149
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,640
that Marx ascribes to religion.

2150
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,080
But release from the general anguish of human existence

2151
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,680
is not a political goal.

2152
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,800
There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries,

2153
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,440
and so far, zero utopias.

2154
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,280
Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,

2155
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,640
are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.

2156
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,440
When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.

2157
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,240
And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.

2158
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,240
And because of the proximity effect,

2159
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,200
envy may actually increase after the revolution.

2160
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,560
You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade,

2161
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,320
a successful citoyen, oui, a kulak,

2162
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,400
than you ever were of the aristocrats.

2163
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,840
So envy turns paranoid and imaginative

2164
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,600
in revolutionary moments.

2165
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,240
It gets sublimated into morality,

2166
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,720
and the accusations start flying.

2167
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,680
That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.

2168
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,680
That peasant is hoarding grain.

2169
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,720
So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,

2170
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,160
the gulags fill up.

2171
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,120
For an authoritarian, strongman takes over

2172
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,560
just to announce another revolution two decades later.

2173
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,440
The things people will do to stay relevant, honestly.

2174
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,240
And for what?

2175
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:33,840
What long-term egalitarian utopia results?

2176
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,000
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

2177
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,800
So look, I do understand that sometimes

2178
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,400
you just have to do a revolution.

2179
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,240
And if I'd been there in 1789,

2180
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,120
I'm sure I'd be storming the Bastille myself.

2181
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,600
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

2182
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,280
Revolution is a bloody nightmare

2183
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,440
that happens because society is collapsing

2184
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,720
and people are desperate.

2185
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,120
At worst, revolution is nothing more

2186
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,120
than a violent day of retribution.

2187
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,960
And at best, it lays the groundwork

2188
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,040
for future incremental progress.

2189
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,960
But it will never usher in utopia,

2190
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,280
nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,

2191
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,800
which, I'm sorry to report,

2192
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,640
is simply the resting state of an unsedated human mind.

2193
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,000
Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,

2194
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,960
that all leftist or all egalitarian politics

2195
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,240
is born of envy.

2196
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:20,740
No.

2197
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,200
This is a specific subtype.

2198
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,960
There are plenty of reasons,

2199
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,120
other than envy or fear of envy,

2200
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,280
to oppose an economic distribution

2201
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,440
where some people have billions of dollars

2202
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,640
while other people are dying

2203
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,160
because they can't afford insulin.

2204
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,360
Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources

2205
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,880
to promote human well-being.

2206
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,000
And personally, I just don't want to live in a country

2207
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,560
where people are dying because they can't afford medicine.

2208
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,360
And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes

2209
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,880
for that not to happen.

2210
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,320
So while I'm putting down strawman versions of my argument,

2211
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,080
I'm also not saying,

2212
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,240
oh, let's just stop being envious.

2213
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:56,820
No.

2214
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,080
That's impossible.

2215
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,000
I think envy is like libido.

2216
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,160
It's a basic force of human nature

2217
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,400
that's more or less unstoppable.

2218
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,920
But with the right leadership,

2219
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,520
I think that envy can potentially be sublimated

2220
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,640
or redirected into something more constructive.

2221
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,920
Because raw envy is a very bad basis

2222
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,600
for egalitarian politics.

2223
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,360
It often targets the wrong people,

2224
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,280
like millionaires instead of billionaires,

2225
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,080
and eventually it turns the revolution against itself

2226
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,000
and you get the circular firing squad.

2227
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,440
The self-cannibalism.

2228
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,680
The problem I see on the left today

2229
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,160
is that without any genuine political outlet,

2230
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:35,040
resentment mostly manifests as morality.

2231
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,840
Morality itself being a way to vent

2232
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,840
envious aggression and vindictiveness.

2233
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,480
On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?

2234
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,800
We're all about structural analysis,

2235
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,800
the material conditions,

2236
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,240
systems of power,

2237
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,640
intersectional identity hierarchies.

2238
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,760
But if you look at what people

2239
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,760
actually spend their time doing here,

2240
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,480
it's all this obsessive moral policing.

2241
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,120
I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win

2242
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,040
on any major political stage,

2243
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,560
we feel disempowered.

2244
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,640
And so this moral fanaticism

2245
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,800
is a psychological substitute.

2246
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,400
Like with Marie Antoinette,

2247
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,120
it's easier to blame people than systems.

2248
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,480
Also, structural analysis is very boring,

2249
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,320
and destroying people with gossip

2250
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,920
is extremely entertaining.

2251
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,880
This obsessive moral policing

2252
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,560
also gets turned inward

2253
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,400
and becomes leftist guilt.

2254
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,760
You know, this useless internalized scolding.

2255
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,120
I think I'm done with my makeup.

2256
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,000
What do we think?

2257
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,800
Leave a comment.

2258
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,960
I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare

2259
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,240
since last time I did skincare,

2260
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,760
I was critiqued by Hyram.

2261
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,760
So I am going to spray my face a couple times

2262
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,400
with this Tatcha skin mist,

2263
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,000
if that's okay with Hyram.

2264
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,840
It feels good to finally address this feud.

2265
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,560
Clear the air.

2266
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,760
I look a lot better with makeup.

2267
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,600
I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,

2268
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,360
it's just that it's very much enhanced

2269
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,400
by painting a different face on top of my face.

2270
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,320
But hey, at least this way I've kind of like,

2271
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,600
I've kind of earned it, you know,

2272
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,800
because it's my skill.

2273
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,120
So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist

2274
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,640
that's been running for years,

2275
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,840
and I haven't listened in a while,

2276
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,120
but in the early episodes,

2277
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,320
they'd bring on these women

2278
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,960
who would confess their feminist sins.

2279
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,760
You know,

2280
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,040
hi, my name is Amber,

2281
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,120
I'm a feminist,

2282
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,080
but I enjoy being choked in bed.

2283
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,560
It's hard being a woman.

2284
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,160
Not only are you being choked,

2285
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,920
you also feel guilty about it.

2286
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,000
The same moral hand-wringing

2287
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,840
happens with body positivity.

2288
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,360
When you make loving your body

2289
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,280
into a moral imperative,

2290
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,360
not only are you still going to hate your body,

2291
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,440
but now you're also going to feel guilty

2292
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,640
about hating your body

2293
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,400
because it makes you a bad feminist.

2294
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,840
So there was one problem,

2295
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,360
and now there's two problems.

2296
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
Thanks, morality.

2297
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,320
That's very helpful.

2298
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,160
Now I want to take a moment to acknowledge

2299
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,200
that a lot of conservatives have made some version

2300
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,360
of the argument I'm making in this video.

2301
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,480
For example,

2302
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,720
Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia

2303
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,440
have argued that academic postmodernists

2304
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,040
are motivated by resentment.

2305
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,320
The argument is that

2306
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,480
deconstructionist literary theory

2307
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,720
is a kind of envious vengeance

2308
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,640
against the beauty and virtuosity

2309
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,400
of canonical great art.

2310
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,400
And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.

2311
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,560
A lot of academics are failed artists,

2312
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,320
but I was even more manqué than that.

2313
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,240
I've noticed that working class,

2314
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,920
non-academic socialists

2315
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,080
do tend to be more productive

2316
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,440
and more self-advancing,

2317
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,440
involved in unionizing or organizing.

2318
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,640
Whereas, it's usually people who went to college.

2319
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,160
I went to college!

2320
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,280
Presumably because they had

2321
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,600
middle-class ambitions at some point,

2322
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,000
but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,

2323
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,720
who become the great critiquers of capital.

2324
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,320
I mean, I can tell you from experience

2325
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,000
that when I was eating Chef Boyardee

2326
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,280
over my master's degree,

2327
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,360
that's when I was most likely to say things like,

2328
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,280
according to Antonio Gramsci,

2329
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,520
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

2330
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,320
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology

2331
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,120
manufactures the consent of the civil term.

2332
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,640
Uh, so point taken.

2333
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:58,160
But some conservatives take this argument way too far,

2334
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,000
and try to argue that the entire left

2335
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,320
is nothing but a coalition of resentment.

2336
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,840
Like, there's a video on YouTube

2337
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,080
of the philosophy professor Stephen Hicks

2338
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,080
doing a version of the post-modernism

2339
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,520
is resentment argument,

2340
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,640
and in the comments section,

2341
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,160
there's a bunch of people saying,

2342
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,480
this describes Black Lives Matter,

2343
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,200
Antifa, and the Democrats.

2344
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,080
Does it, though?

2345
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,600
I mean, any political movement

2346
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,040
is gonna have people in it

2347
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,880
who suffer from resentment poisoning.

2348
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,600
But Black Lives Matter, at its core,

2349
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,480
is about the right not to be murdered by police.

2350
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,640
The slogan, Black Lives Matter,

2351
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,840
is an affirmation of the value of black life.

2352
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,800
So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.

2353
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,760
Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

2354
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,280
was inspired by Nietzsche

2355
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,080
to create the slogan All Power to the People.

2356
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,800
When we coined the expression All Power to the People,

2357
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,200
we had in mind emphasizing the word power,

2358
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,280
for we recognize that the will to power

2359
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,880
is the basic drive of man,

2360
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,520
but it is incorrect to seek power over people.

2361
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,160
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power

2362
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,200
of exploitation and racism for hundreds of years,

2363
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,080
and the black community has its will to power also.

2364
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,040
What we seek, however, is not power over people,

2365
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,080
but the power of control of our own destiny.

2366
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,000
That, to me, is a role model

2367
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,840
for how to do identity politics

2368
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,600
without centering resentment.

2369
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,880
It's instead an affirmation of self-determination

2370
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,000
and self-respect.

2371
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,800
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.

2372
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,640
Whereas if your whole political project

2373
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,160
is defined in the negative,

2374
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,360
then you're allowing yourself

2375
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,960
to be defined by your enemies.

2376
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,800
I find feminism is prone to this,

2377
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
where even, and in fact especially,

2378
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,560
the most radical feminists

2379
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,120
cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness

2380
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,720
of being the second sex

2381
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,280
and defining themselves against men.

2382
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,240
Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.

2383
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,560
She's the most radical of radical feminists,

2384
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,440
and my first impulse is actually to defend her

2385
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,680
because she's very widely hated,

2386
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:54,720
and most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.

2387
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,480
Like in that Stephen Hicks video,

2388
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,160
Hicks summarizes Dworkin as

2389
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,360
calling all heterosexual males rapists.

2390
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,720
Literally in the preface to her most famous book,

2391
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:05,920
Dworkin says,

2392
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,800
If one's sexual experience has always,

2393
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,920
and without exception, been based on dominance,

2394
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,160
how could one understand that this book

2395
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,720
does not say that all men are rapists

2396
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,800
or that all intercourse is rape?

2397
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,280
Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor

2398
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,800
and I'm just a makeup vlogger,

2399
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,040
but my gut feeling on this one is,

2400
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,400
before criticizing a book,

2401
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,720
maybe read the book.

2402
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,600
Just a thought.

2403
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,640
Get it together, prof.

2404
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,120
You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.

2405
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,240
I mean, there's no shame in that.

2406
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,440
It happens to me all the time.

2407
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,400
That being said,

2408
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,000
I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct

2409
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,400
that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.

2410
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,720
What Dworkin does say in this book

2411
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,560
is arguably even more bleak

2412
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,320
than what is falsely attributed to her.

2413
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,080
The book is called Intercourse.

2414
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,760
She wrote a book called Intercourse.

2415
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,680
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

2416
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,960
I can actually easily imagine that.

2417
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,520
Never mind.

2418
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,120
So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.

2419
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,040
Penetration, to be specific.

2420
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,880
Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,

2421
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,120
invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.

2422
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,040
So it's against the Freudian

2423
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,680
male castration anxiety interpretation,

2424
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:17,520
where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.

2425
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,800
Imagine being afraid of that.

2426
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,560
Imagine being afraid of that.

2427
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,120
I'm gonna get a facelift someday

2428
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,240
and I'm gonna look like this.

2429
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:27,680
I'm perfect.

2430
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,560
I certainly don't agree with everything she says,

2431
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,040
but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?

2432
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,640
Closer than Freud, anyway.

2433
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:38,400
Think about what men typically say to women during the act.

2434
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,680
Do they say,

2435
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,040
Hell, I'm being devoured.

2436
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,800
Never heard that one.

2437
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,440
Have you?

2438
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,280
No, usually it's more along the lines of,

2439
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,520
You like that, don't you?

2440
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,400
You little.

2441
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,040
Et cetera.

2442
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,600
And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded and enjoy it.

2443
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,200
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation

2444
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,400
because they're taught to.

2445
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,280
But enjoying it, she'd have to say,

2446
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,840
doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.

2447
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,160
So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true

2448
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,920
and some things that are off the fucking rails.

2449
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,800
Where she loses me is where she starts getting blackpilled.

2450
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,680
And this book, this is the feminist blackpill.

2451
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:17,280
It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.

2452
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,080
She says,

2453
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,160
Male-dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.

2454
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,320
This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.

2455
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,120
Uh, okay.

2456
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:31,360
So women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.

2457
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,160
We can dream, Andrea.

2458
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,120
We can dream.

2459
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,960
Like most ideology of resentment,

2460
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,800
this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms

2461
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,440
that might actually improve the situation of women.

2462
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,880
Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence,

2463
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,560
filth, and abjection of it all.

2464
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,160
I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian,

2465
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,960
but in that second wave political way.

2466
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,240
Quoting from the foreword,

2467
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,920
To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.

2468
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,760
In 30 plus years of knowing her,

2469
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,040
I've never heard of a single romance with a woman, not one.

2470
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,600
This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250 page book about sex

2471
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,720
that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.

2472
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:17,840
Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women,

2473
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,960
it's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.

2474
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,840
You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters,

2475
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,120
but I don't think that's true.

2476
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,800
I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.

2477
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,600
The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and, uh, Oedipus the King.

2478
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,160
It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters,

2479
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,680
because they're stuck with this,

2480
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:40,400
and love is closer to hatred than neutrality.

2481
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,640
So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?

2482
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,440
What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?

2483
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,360
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,

2484
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,800
because no one ever told them they could.

2485
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,240
Romance.

2486
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,160
That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.

2487
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,400
Joan Didion, of course, being not like other girls.

2488
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,600
Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.

2489
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,040
Despite all efforts to socialize women to want intercourse,

2490
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,840
women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

2491
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,800
that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.

2492
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,000
That does sound nice.

2493
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,960
I'm so lonely.

2494
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,880
I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women, though.

2495
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,600
Like, there are definitely women out there who, uh,

2496
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,920
they don't make love, Anastasia.

2497
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,160
They f*** hard.

2498
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,320
I'm really sleepy, and this bed right behind me just looks so nice.

2499
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,920
I can't in here right now.

2500
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,480
What if I just go to sleep, and then wake up,

2501
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,880
and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.

2502
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,840
I don't want to do it now.

2503
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,000
I'll get Pikachu, that'll make this easier.

2504
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,440
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

2505
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,600
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

2506
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,080
Why?

2507
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,440
Because he's the yellowest.

2508
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,600
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

2509
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,320
You can't name anything.

2510
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,360
You can't think of anything.

2511
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,120
So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,

2512
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,320
then just say that.

2513
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,680
Is that what you want, Pikachu?

2514
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,680
I bet it is.

2515
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,200
And Dworkin did get married.

2516
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,120
To a gay man.

2517
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,960
So I guess she found what she wanted.

2518
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,240
Lucky.

2519
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,640
Envying Andrea Dworkin.

2520
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,560
Is that really what we've sunk to around here?

2521
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,800
You know, I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.

2522
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,240
I know this isn't very original, but I had a bad year.

2523
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,520
You know, I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot,

2524
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,320
got my heart comprehensively broken,

2525
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,160
and then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to

2526
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,280
spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.

2527
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,280
You know, I stopped saying yes to life,

2528
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,320
and I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.

2529
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,120
By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon,

2530
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:39,600
one of the greatest appropriate-for-all-ages video games of all time.

2531
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,760
Look at him go!

2532
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,880
I'm taking the hair clips out.

2533
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,840
I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

2534
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,520
It's because I'm trans.

2535
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,040
It's because I'm gay.

2536
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,560
That's why I'll die alone.

2537
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,160
Yeah, that's the reason I'm alone.

2538
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,320
Definitely not because I don't leave the house.

2539
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:58,800
See, I am not immune to incel-tier brain poisoning,

2540
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:04,320
and you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.

2541
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,640
Society did this to me.

2542
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:10,400
A transphobic society made me hate myself.

2543
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,520
Well, yeah, that's true.

2544
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,160
But at a certain point, you have to take responsibility for your own mind,

2545
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:21,680
and decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.

2546
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,680
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,

2547
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,280
the mind is its own place,

2548
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,080
and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.

2549
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,040
Yes, squad.

2550
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:32,640
So I ask myself, what kind of mind do I want to be?

2551
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,120
Do I want to obsess over what I lack,

2552
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:38,000
concede society's judgment of my inferiority,

2553
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,400
become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?

2554
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,240
Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor,

2555
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,760
stop chasing the dragon, and say yes to life?

2556
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,480
The answer, of course, is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.

2557
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,920
But we're not gonna do that,

2558
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,960
because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.

2559
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,840
The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

2560
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:08,880
Also, nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.

2561
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,200
It's beyond a personality flaw,

2562
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:16,560
it's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance at happiness you have.

2563
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,960
So in the short time that you're alive,

2564
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,920
you have to discover that which is noble in yourself, and say yes to it.

2565
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,920
You know, don't say no to getting older, say yes to being a MILF.

2566
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,600
Yes, yes.

2567
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,120
What I'm really trying to say here is,

2568
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,400
Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.

2569
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,600
Spongebob says yes to life, and so should we.

2570
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,120
Yes to ourselves.

2571
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,160
Yes to art.

2572
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,680
Yes to sensuality.

2573
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,200
Yes to the world.

2574
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,080
Yes.

2575
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,040
Yes.

2576
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,400
Eh, we.

2577
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,960
Is this really how we're ending the video?

2578
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,120
I guess.

2579
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,480
Okay, bye!

2580
01:45:52,480 --> 01:46:08,640
🎶

2581
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,040
Oh, so what if my fantasies make no sense?

2582
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,040
You wanna talk about things that don't make sense?

2583
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,240
Heterosexuality.

2584
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,320
Let's put that under the microscope, hmm?

2585
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,040
You want me to believe that a straight woman,

2586
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,840
who knows the difference between magenta and mauve,

2587
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,680
is gonna date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,

2588
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,520
and that's just gonna work out fine.

2589
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,000
You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?

2590
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,000
I don't think so.

2591
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,200
Not on my watch.

2592
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,440
See, I think straight men should date each other.

2593
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,640
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then f*** each other.

2594
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,880
And then straight women can pair off,

2595
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,480
decoupage some shit,

2596
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,920
and eat each other out.

2597
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,880
Isn't that better?

2598
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,080
Isn't that more rational?

2599
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,840
I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.

2600
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,640
Like, I wish I had anatomical control over them.

2601
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,140
Hello?

2602
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,960
Yes, Dr. Spiegel?

2603
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,480
Yes, it's me again.

2604
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,480
I have a suggestion.

2605
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:57,280
What do we even have here?

2606
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:02,880
We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp,

2607
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,160
some, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.

2608
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,600
I've never been as much into rolls.

2609
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,120
I'm a cat, you know I like fish.

2610
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,840
You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.

2611
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,640
It's an affront to my feline nature.

2612
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:52,640
So

2613
01:47:52,640 --> 01:48:15,600
Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
