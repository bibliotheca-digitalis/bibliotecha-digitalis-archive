WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.960
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

00:25.960 --> 00:26.960
We have to dial in.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.760
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

00:33.760 --> 00:41.240
This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

00:41.240 --> 00:45.080
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.160
There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,

00:49.160 --> 00:54.720
there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.040
One twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,

01:00.040 --> 01:06.240
and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

01:06.240 --> 01:12.200
So when the day arrived, and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned

01:12.200 --> 01:17.400
out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

01:17.400 --> 01:22.200
that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean if you weren't

01:22.200 --> 01:27.440
on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.560
Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and

01:32.560 --> 01:33.880
rich white kids.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.960
Yuppie hunger games hosted by Ja Rule.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.720
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.400
Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
Let them eat salad.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.960
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.000
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those

01:57.000 --> 01:59.240
sandwiches were garbage.

01:59.240 --> 02:08.120
Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.760
Imagine looking like this.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.360
Imagine being perfect.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.000
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.520
Why are you doing this to women?

02:15.520 --> 02:19.280
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila,

02:19.280 --> 02:21.640
Your skin is so perfect, uwu.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.000
And Jamila replied,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.560
My skin is currently clear because A. Privileged people have more access to good

02:28.560 --> 02:35.360
quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those with less privilege.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.640
I also get to sleep more because of this.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.880
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
easily.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.960
B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.680
C. I exfoliate twice a week.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Oh boy.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.600
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, gorge.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.040
I'll protect you, queen.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.080
Could she be any more annoying?

02:56.080 --> 02:58.920
Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.480
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

03:07.480 --> 03:12.000
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

03:12.120 --> 03:18.800
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

03:18.800 --> 03:24.640
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality,

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
does it?

03:25.640 --> 03:30.440
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

03:30.440 --> 03:31.440
your privilege.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.160
A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous

03:36.160 --> 03:42.360
now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.

03:42.360 --> 03:46.760
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to it.

03:46.760 --> 03:52.240
I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
Take me, mother.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

03:57.960 --> 03:59.760
of the coronavirus pandemic.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.280
40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.360
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

04:07.360 --> 04:10.280
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

04:10.280 --> 04:15.200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

04:15.200 --> 04:19.760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

04:19.760 --> 04:22.200
normal for just a brief moment in time.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.800
I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so

04:26.840 --> 04:31.840
in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.560
Hashtag thisis40, tag me bitch.

04:35.560 --> 04:42.000
So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege-checking maneuver, and once again,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
it has not gone well.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.080
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century, bragging about being humble and letting us

04:49.080 --> 04:50.080
eat cake.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.120
Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being

04:55.120 --> 04:58.640
evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?

04:58.640 --> 05:04.400
Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone-deaf humbled and blessed line, hashtag

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
gross.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.160
Happy birthday, mmm.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.760
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read the motherfucking-

05:11.760 --> 05:16.720
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

05:16.720 --> 05:21.480
was not that she had the party, I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
that milf money?

05:22.640 --> 05:29.040
The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

05:29.040 --> 05:30.680
a little bit yikesy.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.720
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

05:35.720 --> 05:38.400
This isn't a good look, we say.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.880
Bad optics.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.880
Not relatable.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
Relatable.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.160
Relatability is not a moral category.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.600
This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.400
Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,

05:52.400 --> 05:56.840
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.400
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.280
This should have stayed in the drafts.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.280
Hashtag tone-deaf.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.520
Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?

06:09.520 --> 06:14.200
We didn't get to have birthday parties, some people couldn't even travel to visit

06:14.200 --> 06:16.000
their dying relatives.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.920
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.

06:22.920 --> 06:27.000
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.680
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

06:33.680 --> 06:41.760
music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jameel's privileged pores,

06:41.760 --> 06:43.840
no one ever uses the word envy.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.440
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
own psychology.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.840
So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.920
What is it, where does it come from, and seriously, what is Jameela Jameel's skincare routine?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.440
Drop it in the comments, bestie.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.560
Okay, so what is envy?

07:03.560 --> 07:08.800
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.200
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

07:15.200 --> 07:17.800
what we want, but cannot get.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.560
It's not simply wanting what another person has, that's greed, which is a much more

07:22.560 --> 07:24.040
wholesome sin.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.320
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

07:29.320 --> 07:32.000
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.400
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy, it's emulation or admiration.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.760
At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.760
It covets.

07:41.760 --> 07:47.800
Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
they have.

07:48.800 --> 07:54.200
You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated

07:54.200 --> 07:59.640
and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

07:59.640 --> 08:05.360
Like Satan, who was willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John Milfton.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.120
It's gonna be 90 minutes of Milf jokes, kids, so strap in.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.040
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

08:12.040 --> 08:18.360
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

08:18.360 --> 08:22.560
celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

08:22.560 --> 08:28.440
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,

08:28.440 --> 08:29.880
masculine men.

08:29.880 --> 08:36.040
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

08:36.040 --> 08:41.560
want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

08:41.560 --> 08:45.200
Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.520
So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's emulation,

08:50.520 --> 08:56.080
the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more popular option,

08:56.080 --> 08:58.080
you can take the black pill.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.720
Which means believing that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no

09:02.720 --> 09:08.160
woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.

09:08.160 --> 09:14.320
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire wikipedia

09:14.320 --> 09:16.800
timeline dedicated to tracking them.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.960
And the essential motivation for this violence is envy.

09:20.960 --> 09:27.600
The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable predestined inferiority turns venomous.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.200
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,

09:33.200 --> 09:35.360
then no one can.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.200
In the words of a murderer,

09:37.200 --> 09:42.880
The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.440
But most incels aren't murderers.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.000
Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.160
The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.720
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.040
Because the other sins are fun, right?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.360
Greed, gluttony, lust?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.200
That's what I call a good time.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.520
But envy is misery.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.720
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

10:10.720 --> 10:16.480
Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would

10:16.480 --> 10:19.040
be like without rich parents.

10:19.040 --> 10:19.540
Yes.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.240
Rich refugee crisis.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.680
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.640
Look around you.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.400
We've got the guillotine memes.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.280
We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.800
And none of this is new.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.920
The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

10:37.920 --> 10:40.720
Jaja Gabor, who supposedly said,

10:40.720 --> 10:46.800
When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
And fair enough, it's a good source of protein.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.240
But take it from me kids,

10:50.240 --> 10:53.440
cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.120
It's hard to do just once.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.560
You develop a taste for it.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.480
It's like they say at NA meetings,

10:58.480 --> 11:00.960
once you've lured, you just want more.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.040
Also, who counts as the rich?

11:03.040 --> 11:04.240
Am I the rich?

11:04.240 --> 11:06.480
I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat.

11:06.480 --> 11:06.980
EAT.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.300
Stop it.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.760
See, this is why I quit academia.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.560
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.320
And I don't want to behave myself.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.600
I want to be bad.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.800
Do you want to be bad with me?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.120
Let's be bad.

11:21.440 --> 11:49.600
So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality,

11:49.600 --> 11:52.960
and that societies that have more inequality have more envy.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.160
I used to assume that too.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.720
But the more I think about it, the more I realize,

11:56.720 --> 11:58.080
that might not be true.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.160
Envy is a basic part of human nature.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.520
It exists in all societies and all economic systems,

12:03.520 --> 12:08.080
and it begins any time two or more people start comparing themselves.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.040
Part Two.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.800
The Desire for Mommy's Milk.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.640
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy,

12:16.640 --> 12:17.280
Daddy!

12:17.280 --> 12:20.800
The first stage of human development is the oral stage,

12:20.800 --> 12:24.240
in which the primary concern is oral gratification,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.800
which is of course provided by mommy milkies.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.560
Am I doing too much?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.000
I'll tone it down just a little bit.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.840
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud,

12:33.840 --> 12:36.960
and it's true, he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend

12:36.960 --> 12:38.880
who had some zany ideas.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.080
Like penis envy.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.800
Maybe there's transgender men who experience that,

12:42.800 --> 12:46.000
but I don't think it's a basic fact of the female condition.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.120
As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

12:49.120 --> 12:50.480
Because I take that personally.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.880
I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.800
But I feel like even when Freud is wrong,

12:55.360 --> 12:57.600
he's often at least onto something.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.520
Like with the Oedipus Complex,

12:59.520 --> 13:02.480
it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?

13:03.040 --> 13:04.160
That would be weird.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.720
It's more that you desire an archetype.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.840
Mother, right?

13:08.480 --> 13:09.200
Mommy.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.080
You guys get it.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.840
Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.160
They're the ones who got me started on this milk shit.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.600
I'm a reverse Socrates.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.120
I've been corrupted by the young.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.320
My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.120
So Freud says that in the first two years of life,

13:23.120 --> 13:26.320
libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.080
And it's also in this stage that envy first emerges.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.320
So I was the oldest child in my family,

13:32.320 --> 13:34.960
and I was less than two years old when my brother was born.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.520
So I don't remember this because I was one year old,

13:37.520 --> 13:40.480
but my family tells me that when my brother was born,

13:40.480 --> 13:43.040
I was just insanely jealous.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.480
Oh, and I guess now's a good time

13:44.480 --> 13:47.280
to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.080
Scholars agree that there is a difference,

13:50.080 --> 13:53.440
and usually they describe the difference

13:53.440 --> 13:54.720
in one of two ways.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.520
The first is that jealousy is defensive.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.720
It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.040
Whereas envy is offensive.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.400
It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.240
And the second difference is that envy

14:08.240 --> 14:11.200
is between two people, the envier and the envied,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.680
whereas jealousy typically involves three people.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.400
As in romantic jealousy, where you have the subject,

14:16.400 --> 14:18.800
the romantic object, and then the rival.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.800
And the subject is jealous of the rival

14:20.800 --> 14:23.200
because they're protective of their relationship

14:23.200 --> 14:24.720
with the romantic object.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.120
And that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry,

14:27.120 --> 14:30.160
just substituting the romantic object for mommy.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.520
Of course in ordinary English,

14:31.520 --> 14:33.200
people are always gonna say jealousy

14:33.200 --> 14:34.880
when they really mean envy,

14:34.880 --> 14:38.320
probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
And I think it's pointless to try to fight that,

14:40.320 --> 14:42.720
like I wouldn't go around correcting people,

14:42.720 --> 14:44.800
but just keep in mind that there is a difference.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.560
So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?

14:48.560 --> 14:49.840
Well I think it's both,

14:49.840 --> 14:51.840
because initially you're defensive

14:51.840 --> 14:54.080
of your privileged only child relationship

14:54.080 --> 14:55.120
with your parents.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.840
But a new baby often gets more attention,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.160
at least in your paranoid toddler brain,

15:00.160 --> 15:02.240
and you might be envious of that.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.440
And in romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival

15:05.440 --> 15:07.840
if she has qualities that you wish you had.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.000
You know, young kids are little egotists

15:10.000 --> 15:12.880
who are very sensitive to when another child

15:12.880 --> 15:15.040
might be getting preferential treatment.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.840
One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies

15:17.840 --> 15:20.000
is it's not fair.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.520
It's not fair.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.040
Tell me about it, Pampino.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.080
And I've got bad news.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.360
Life is not getting any more fair than this.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.800
According to the Bible,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.040
one of the first events in human history

15:33.040 --> 15:37.040
is the story of Cain y Abel, los dos hermanos.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.040
I don't know why I said it in Spanish.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.560
I guess I just thought it would sound cool.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.400
Was I wrong?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.200
Cain.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.200
It just sounds so much better than Cain.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
Cain and Abel.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.560
Cain and Abel.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.520
God tells Cain and Abel each to make a sacrifice,

15:51.520 --> 15:53.680
and then God prefers Abel's.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.800
You know, because God loves meat.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.840
Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel,

15:59.840 --> 16:01.760
in spite towards God the Father,

16:01.760 --> 16:04.080
Cain kills his younger brother.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.480
In my earliest memories of my brother,

16:06.480 --> 16:07.840
I already loved him,

16:07.840 --> 16:09.680
and I don't remember the envy.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.680
So I guess I wasn't a Cain.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.320
Cain.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.800
So I must have somehow worked through this

16:14.800 --> 16:16.240
without resorting to murder.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.800
Freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger

16:20.800 --> 16:23.600
leads to a recognition of impotence.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.640
Because at first,

16:24.640 --> 16:28.320
you selfishly want to be the special most-loved child.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.480
But you see that your parents love your sibling

16:30.480 --> 16:31.520
just as much as you,

16:32.080 --> 16:34.240
and you're powerless to do anything about it.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.440
So your ambition to superiority fails.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.120
And so you have no choice

16:39.120 --> 16:41.920
but to repress your ambition to superiority

16:41.920 --> 16:43.200
as well as your envy.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.120
And the result of that repression

16:45.120 --> 16:48.000
is what we could call herd instinct.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.040
Solidarity.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.760
This feeling of identifying with a group,

16:51.760 --> 16:53.120
the equal siblings.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.160
And as you get older,

16:54.160 --> 16:57.120
the herd instinct evolves into feelings about

16:57.120 --> 17:00.160
justice, duty, community, and equality.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.000
But Freud thought these feelings

17:02.000 --> 17:05.680
retain a vestige of repressed envy.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.440
If I can't be the favorite,

17:07.440 --> 17:09.600
if I can't have special privileges,

17:10.400 --> 17:12.240
then no one can.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.840
And from these observations,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.760
Freud made the generalization,

17:15.760 --> 17:20.000
Social justice means that we deny ourselves

17:20.000 --> 17:22.560
many things so that others

17:22.560 --> 17:25.280
may have to do without them as well.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.040
Okay, so we don't want other people

17:27.040 --> 17:29.520
to have anything we can't have.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.720
So we enviously insist on equality

17:32.720 --> 17:34.080
as a defense against

17:34.080 --> 17:36.240
the greater prosperity of others.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.720
Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.080
Like I think Freud is definitely

17:40.080 --> 17:41.520
onto something here.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.600
But don't some of our community feelings

17:43.600 --> 17:45.520
also come from a place of

17:45.520 --> 17:47.360
genuine care for other people?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.200
I cared for someone once.

17:52.960 --> 17:53.920
Rosalind.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.760
Well, we'll come back to that later.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.280
Let's put a pin in me for now.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.760
A pin in it for now.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.800
In Freud, I mean.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.200
Let's put a pin in Freud.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.680
In a 1966 book titled Envy,

18:09.680 --> 18:11.440
A Theory of Social Behavior,

18:11.440 --> 18:14.000
the sociologist Helmut Schuck argued

18:14.000 --> 18:14.880
that rather than being,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.400
that is a very German name.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.360
Helmut Schuck?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.440
It's putting me in a German mood, sweetie.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.280
Hallo meine Lieben.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.760
Heute gibt's ein neues Video.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.600
I just get worse at German every year.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.280
Schuck argued that rather than being

18:27.280 --> 18:29.840
the result of social or economic inequality,

18:29.840 --> 18:33.120
envy is a universal across all human societies,

18:33.120 --> 18:35.440
including very egalitarian ones.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.160
For example, in tribal and village cultures

18:38.160 --> 18:39.120
around the world,

18:39.120 --> 18:41.520
there's often a concept of black magic

18:41.520 --> 18:42.720
or witchcraft,

18:42.720 --> 18:45.280
which are thought to be used by envious people

18:45.280 --> 18:47.360
to bewitch the ones they envy.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.960
You're probably familiar with the concept

18:48.960 --> 18:50.080
of the evil eye,

18:50.080 --> 18:51.760
which originates in ancient Greece

18:51.760 --> 18:53.600
or maybe even earlier than that.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.760
Cultures all over the world today

18:55.760 --> 18:58.960
understand the evil eye as a kind of curse

18:58.960 --> 19:02.240
cast by the malignant gaze of an envious person.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.640
Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.280
but I actually think the concept of the evil eye

19:07.280 --> 19:10.480
reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy

19:10.480 --> 19:12.880
and of the social danger that it poses.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.360
You've probably seen these amulets around,

19:15.360 --> 19:16.880
there's an emoji for them now,

19:16.880 --> 19:19.520
which are supposed to protect against the evil eye.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.040
It's called a nazar,

19:21.040 --> 19:24.160
which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.320
similar to the origin of the English word envy,

19:26.320 --> 19:27.920
which is the Latin invidia,

19:27.920 --> 19:29.840
which just means to look at.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.920
So there's an agreement across cultures

19:31.920 --> 19:33.760
that envy is related to sight,

19:33.760 --> 19:35.280
the malevolent gaze,

19:35.280 --> 19:36.240
the evil eye.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.400
And these amulets show that a lot of people

19:38.400 --> 19:40.320
are afraid of being envied

19:40.320 --> 19:42.080
and want to protect themselves.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.320
I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel

19:44.320 --> 19:46.000
with an episode on the evil eye

19:46.000 --> 19:48.560
and the host explains that for Muslims,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.000
it's customary to say,

19:51.680 --> 19:54.800
or God has willed it when admiring a person or object,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.200
you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.

19:57.200 --> 19:57.920
I love that.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.880
It's like no envy,

19:58.880 --> 20:00.640
like no homo, but no envy.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.240
Mashallah.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.840
The top comment on that video says,

20:19.040 --> 20:20.480
See, this is where Kim Kardashian

20:20.480 --> 20:22.240
went wrong with her birthday post.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.520
Clearly, no one in the Kardashian cinematic universe

20:25.520 --> 20:27.120
has ever heard of the evil eye.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.880
Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.240
Why haven't they heard of the evil eye?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.960
Oh, okay, nevermind.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.200
Every piece of media they've ever produced

20:35.200 --> 20:37.840
is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.400
This is a particularly American thing.

20:40.400 --> 20:44.720
Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.520
Like there's advertisements here that literally promise,

20:47.520 --> 20:51.120
if you buy this exclusive luxury vibrator,

20:51.120 --> 20:53.360
you'll be the envy of all your friends.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.440
As if it's a good thing to be envied.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.120
Oh, but it is not.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.760
If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.840
They seethe over your successes

21:01.840 --> 21:03.760
and celebrate your misfortunes.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.440
Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.760
So why would anyone want to be envied?

21:09.760 --> 21:11.600
Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.000
On the one hand, we need to be loved,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.080
but then there's this other drive in us,

21:16.080 --> 21:21.280
this like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches,

21:21.280 --> 21:24.320
which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.640
In a past Gilded Age, there were stories

21:26.640 --> 21:29.440
like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard,

21:29.440 --> 21:32.320
which warned what a sad and lonely thing

21:32.320 --> 21:34.080
success can become.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.680
In ancient democratic Athens,

21:37.680 --> 21:40.560
there was a practice called ostrachismus,

21:40.560 --> 21:43.600
which is the origin of the English word ostracism.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.200
Ostracism was a procedure

21:45.200 --> 21:47.200
where the Athenians would assemble

21:47.200 --> 21:48.960
and each person would write the name

21:48.960 --> 21:51.280
of a person they wanted to ostracize

21:51.280 --> 21:53.840
on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.360
And whoever got the most votes

21:55.360 --> 21:58.480
would simply be banished from the city for 10 years,

21:58.480 --> 21:59.840
no questions asked.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.160
I love the ancient world.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.240
Things were so direct.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
Often this was used to remove someone

22:06.240 --> 22:09.600
who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant

22:09.600 --> 22:10.720
or just annoying.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.160
According to Plutarch,

22:12.160 --> 22:13.920
I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia,

22:13.920 --> 22:15.840
in one anecdote about Aristides,

22:15.840 --> 22:18.160
known as Aristides the Just,

22:18.160 --> 22:20.480
who was ostracized in 482,

22:20.480 --> 22:23.040
an illiterate citizen not recognizing him

22:23.120 --> 22:25.520
came up to ask him to write the name Aristides

22:25.520 --> 22:26.640
on his ostracon.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.240
When Aristides asked why,

22:28.240 --> 22:29.440
the man replied,

22:29.440 --> 22:31.040
it was because he was sick of hearing him

22:31.040 --> 22:32.560
being called the Just.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.480
It's good!

22:35.120 --> 22:36.320
It's so good!

22:36.320 --> 22:38.880
See this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.600
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.200
People in most cultures,

22:43.200 --> 22:43.920
not all,

22:43.920 --> 22:45.920
but most cultures understand

22:45.920 --> 22:48.720
that being envied is a massive social liability,

22:48.720 --> 22:51.760
so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.440
According to a Tamil saying,

22:53.440 --> 22:56.160
the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.720
This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome

22:58.720 --> 23:01.920
because the tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.560
Shook argues that the fear of envy

23:04.560 --> 23:07.600
is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.560
In Haiti,

23:08.560 --> 23:10.240
G.E. Simpson found that a peasant

23:10.240 --> 23:12.720
will seek to disguise his true economic position

23:12.720 --> 23:14.640
by purchasing several smaller fields

23:14.640 --> 23:16.720
rather than one larger piece of land.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.600
For the same reason,

23:17.600 --> 23:19.200
he will not wear good clothes.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.480
He does this intentionally

23:20.480 --> 23:23.040
to protect himself against the envious black magic

23:23.040 --> 23:24.000
of his neighbors.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.480
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.360
Like I've known people from seriously wealthy families

23:29.360 --> 23:30.560
who move to the city

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
and they dress like gutter punks,

23:32.560 --> 23:34.880
like they're trying to pass as poor.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.000
But in general,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.440
Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy

23:39.440 --> 23:41.120
in the way many other cultures do,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.720
and I don't think that's an accident.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.320
We're a nation of show-offs,

23:44.320 --> 23:46.640
and so the taboo against discussing envy

23:46.640 --> 23:48.560
is related to our whole national ethos

23:48.640 --> 23:50.560
of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.680
But though the fear of envy

23:51.680 --> 23:54.080
isn't widely talked about or admitted here,

23:54.080 --> 23:55.520
it's definitely still there,

23:55.520 --> 23:56.640
only repressed,

23:56.640 --> 23:59.440
confined to the realm of dreams and art.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.480
In the movie Black Swan,

24:04.480 --> 24:07.040
Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina

24:07.040 --> 24:08.080
who achieves her dream

24:08.080 --> 24:10.240
of getting the lead role in Swan Lake,

24:10.240 --> 24:11.680
after which her life and mind

24:11.680 --> 24:14.880
are totally unraveled by fear of envy.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.920
Black magic,

24:15.920 --> 24:16.960
Black Swan.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.200
At first we see how Nina's success

24:19.200 --> 24:22.160
comes at the very real cost of being envied,

24:22.160 --> 24:24.080
by her ex-ballerina mother,

24:24.080 --> 24:26.240
by the other girls in the company,

24:26.240 --> 24:29.120
and by the former lead ballerina she's replaced.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.400
Did you suck his c***?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.640
Not all of us have to.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.440
I love Winona Ryder so much.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.200
I love Natalie Portman so much.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
I love Mila Kunis so much.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.160
I just like women.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.840
Where's my shock wand?

24:41.840 --> 24:42.560
Stop it.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.440
Stop standing.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.480
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.240
as Nina begins hallucinating

24:48.240 --> 24:50.000
Black Swan doppelgangers,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.200
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis,

24:53.200 --> 24:54.880
who's trying to steal her role.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.800
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.400
They'll getcha.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.920
Did you have some sort of

24:59.920 --> 25:01.600
lesbian dream about me?

25:01.600 --> 25:02.160
Stop.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.160
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering

25:04.160 --> 25:05.920
a kind of self-envy,

25:05.920 --> 25:08.080
where she envies the disinhibited,

25:08.080 --> 25:09.440
sexually liberated,

25:09.440 --> 25:11.120
corrupted part of herself

25:11.120 --> 25:13.440
that's capable of adult eroticism,

25:13.440 --> 25:15.360
and also of dancing the Black Swan.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.920
So she imagines that part of herself

25:17.920 --> 25:21.200
as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.560
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.800
There's her dominant White Swan impulse,

25:26.800 --> 25:29.760
which we could call the Squidward personality,

25:29.760 --> 25:31.680
perfectionistic and orderly,

25:31.680 --> 25:32.960
but reserved,

25:32.960 --> 25:33.920
priggish,

25:33.920 --> 25:34.880
stiff.

25:34.880 --> 25:38.400
And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse,

25:38.400 --> 25:41.680
which we could call the SpongeBob personality,

25:41.680 --> 25:42.640
intuitive,

25:42.640 --> 25:43.600
chaotic,

25:43.600 --> 25:44.320
ecstatic.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.640
In SpongeBob SquarePants,

25:46.640 --> 25:50.880
the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy,

25:50.880 --> 25:52.320
stemming from failed ambition.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.400
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.560
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement

25:58.560 --> 26:00.160
but remains a mediocrity,

26:00.160 --> 26:03.040
partly because of his overly dry,

26:03.040 --> 26:05.520
doctrinaire attitude towards art.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.000
SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.280
They're literally neighbors,

26:09.280 --> 26:11.920
and they both work the same fast food service job

26:11.920 --> 26:14.320
for the same exploitative capitalist.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.760
But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius

26:17.760 --> 26:20.800
who's able to transform the most mundane activities,

26:20.800 --> 26:22.080
blowing bubbles,

26:22.080 --> 26:23.200
flipping burgers,

26:23.200 --> 26:25.360
into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

26:25.360 --> 26:29.280
Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy

26:29.280 --> 26:31.120
and intuitive creativity,

26:31.120 --> 26:33.680
but he can't admit that envy to himself.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.360
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling

26:37.360 --> 26:38.560
is contempt,

26:38.640 --> 26:42.400
snobbish disdain for SpongeBob's childish behavior.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.120
What the people want is culture,

26:45.120 --> 26:47.040
not dancing bubbles.

26:47.040 --> 26:47.920
Though deep down,

26:47.920 --> 26:50.960
Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.400
It's beautiful.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.560
Uh, I mean, uh.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.080
Which we see when he can't help himself

26:56.080 --> 26:57.440
from blowing bubbles,

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
or when he trades away all of his possessions

26:59.440 --> 27:02.160
for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands

27:02.160 --> 27:04.320
was a source of infinite entertainment.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.280
A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid

27:07.280 --> 27:08.480
re-watch it now,

27:08.480 --> 27:10.000
and are horrified to discover

27:10.000 --> 27:11.840
that they identify with Squidward,

27:11.840 --> 27:13.040
whereas as children,

27:13.040 --> 27:14.720
they identified with SpongeBob.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.400
Well, you either die as SpongeBob,

27:16.400 --> 27:18.160
or you live long enough to see yourself

27:18.160 --> 27:19.120
become the Squidward.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.920
FUTURE!

27:21.920 --> 27:24.080
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward,

27:24.080 --> 27:25.920
which is usually explained as

27:25.920 --> 27:28.400
the disappointing drudgery of adult life,

27:28.400 --> 27:30.240
or simply loss of childhood.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.720
I would argue that envy of childhood

27:32.720 --> 27:35.680
is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.560
Squidwardian?

27:36.560 --> 27:37.840
Are we saying that word?

27:37.840 --> 27:39.440
Are we really saying that word out loud?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.360
To an audience of millions?

27:42.720 --> 27:43.600
Okay!

27:43.600 --> 27:45.520
It's basically the same dynamic

27:45.520 --> 27:49.040
as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.680
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!

27:51.680 --> 27:53.440
You gotta watch out for that one, kids.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.280
If a mysterious stranger shows up

27:55.280 --> 27:56.720
on your doorstep at midnight

27:56.720 --> 27:59.840
asking you to compose a requiem mass for your own father,

27:59.840 --> 28:01.200
just say no.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.840
So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.320
we have a diligent though stuffy wannabe,

28:06.320 --> 28:08.160
envying the effortless playfulness

28:08.160 --> 28:09.760
of the spontaneous genius.

28:09.760 --> 28:25.520
Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is,

28:25.520 --> 28:28.080
well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.480
Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants

28:30.480 --> 28:32.320
through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.240
stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,

28:34.240 --> 28:36.320
we could say that Squidward represents

28:36.320 --> 28:38.640
what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,

28:38.640 --> 28:41.440
while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.960
Nietzsche thought there were two

28:42.960 --> 28:46.480
conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.120
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo,

28:49.120 --> 28:53.680
is the drive towards self-control, order, logic, morality.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.240
And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus,

28:56.240 --> 29:00.960
is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.640
Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives

29:04.640 --> 29:09.360
in conflict, with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.440
Of course, this is a misrepresentation

29:11.440 --> 29:13.520
of how art is actually created,

29:13.520 --> 29:15.280
because Nietzsche's whole point is that

29:15.280 --> 29:17.520
you need a balance of the two drives.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.880
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist

29:20.880 --> 29:23.760
like SpongeBob, because creating good art

29:23.760 --> 29:27.040
requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.200
See? It is all in the technique.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.840
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.120
Get off the stage!

29:33.120 --> 29:36.880
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.200
In order to give the perfect performance,

29:39.200 --> 29:42.320
Mina has to unify her fragmented personality

29:42.320 --> 29:45.680
and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry

29:45.680 --> 29:47.680
between her two artistic impulses.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.600
It was perfect.

29:50.560 --> 29:59.520
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina-doppelgangers

30:00.720 --> 30:01.760
Can you guess it?

30:01.760 --> 30:05.120
is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,

30:05.120 --> 30:08.880
which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
of the American middle class.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.320
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family

30:14.320 --> 30:16.560
with a vacation house and a boat,

30:16.560 --> 30:20.960
along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family

30:20.960 --> 30:22.720
whom the Wilsons envy.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.400
Saw their new car, right?

30:24.400 --> 30:25.120
You had to do it.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.920
You just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.400
One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded

30:30.400 --> 30:33.760
by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.560
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,

30:36.560 --> 30:39.600
explains that her family is metaphysically tethered

30:39.600 --> 30:42.960
to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions

30:42.960 --> 30:46.160
of their lives in a liminal backroom's underworld.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.520
It's super fucking liminal.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.760
I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.320
Not again.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.840
Once upon a time, there was a girl,

30:53.840 --> 30:55.360
and the girl had a shadow.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.120
The two were connected, tethered together.

30:59.680 --> 31:04.080
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.400
But when the shadow was hungry,

31:06.960 --> 31:10.560
she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.680
We later find out that all over the US,

31:13.680 --> 31:16.000
O-U-S spells us.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.840
Hey, that's the title of the movie.

31:17.840 --> 31:18.880
Ohhhhh.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.200
The tethered have risen up to kill

31:21.200 --> 31:23.280
their privileged doppelgangers,

31:23.280 --> 31:25.520
and to link arms across the country

31:25.520 --> 31:27.440
in a dark parody of the real world

31:27.440 --> 31:31.600
1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across America.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.800
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression

31:34.800 --> 31:37.680
of middle class guilt about privilege,

31:37.680 --> 31:38.960
and fear of envy.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.440
It's not a movie about the working class.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.520
If it was a movie about the working class,

31:43.520 --> 31:44.880
then the working class would be able

31:44.880 --> 31:46.320
to speak human languages,

31:46.320 --> 31:47.920
and would not be scary monsters

31:47.920 --> 31:49.120
who make animal sounds

31:50.240 --> 31:52.480
and stagger around like zombies.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.600
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's

31:55.600 --> 31:58.000
nightmare of the working class.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.400
Us represents in a self-aware way

32:00.400 --> 32:03.920
what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.080
The fear of the envious poor,

32:06.080 --> 32:08.880
of revolution, of slave revolt.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.040
Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.840
But Us diverges from other home invasion movies

32:13.840 --> 32:16.800
by not just being fearful about the underclass,

32:16.800 --> 32:18.560
but also guilty.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.360
The idea of the tethered underclass

32:21.360 --> 32:23.840
represents life as a zero-sum game

32:23.840 --> 32:26.160
where every moment of your happiness

32:26.160 --> 32:29.280
is bought with someone else's suffering.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.680
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy,

32:31.680 --> 32:35.280
an internalization of the black magic logic

32:35.280 --> 32:38.000
of people who blame their own misfortunes

32:38.000 --> 32:39.440
on the people they envy.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.800
As Shook puts it,

32:40.800 --> 32:42.000
my neighbor's harvest

32:42.000 --> 32:43.920
can only have turned out better than mine

32:43.920 --> 32:45.600
because he has somehow succeeded

32:45.600 --> 32:47.760
in reducing mine by black magic.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.040
So the fear of envy and the guilt of success

32:51.040 --> 32:53.280
are repressed in American culture,

32:53.280 --> 32:55.600
but they still find expression in movies.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.960
Jordan Peele is kind of like

32:56.960 --> 32:59.440
the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.160
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol,

33:02.160 --> 33:03.840
a story about the guilt of the rich

33:03.840 --> 33:05.040
if ever there was one.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.040
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts

33:07.040 --> 33:09.040
who show him how wretched and sad

33:09.120 --> 33:11.040
the lives of his employees are,

33:11.040 --> 33:14.160
and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.720
and his funeral is only attended by businessmen

33:16.720 --> 33:19.280
on the condition that lunch is provided.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.960
Dickens was truly the master

33:20.960 --> 33:22.800
of scaring the rich straight.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.560
So maybe fear of envy

33:24.560 --> 33:27.280
can serve a softly regulatory function

33:27.280 --> 33:30.640
by motivating charity and generosity in the rich.

33:30.640 --> 33:31.760
But in general,

33:31.760 --> 33:35.200
I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.400
Because remember,

33:36.400 --> 33:38.480
the basic logic of envy is,

33:39.040 --> 33:41.920
if I can't have it, then no one can.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.160
Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.320
It's taking privileges away,

33:48.320 --> 33:51.120
not for the material benefit of the underprivileged,

33:51.120 --> 33:54.400
but merely for the psychological satisfaction

33:54.400 --> 33:55.840
of the envious person.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.840
And that's even worse when you consider

33:57.840 --> 33:59.760
that envy is subjective.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.600
It doesn't necessarily target

34:01.600 --> 34:03.680
objective power and privilege.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.800
So envy in politics is not by any means

34:06.800 --> 34:08.320
relegated to the left.

34:08.320 --> 34:10.880
Conservative politics is brimming with envy.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.840
Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt,

34:13.840 --> 34:15.360
you often hear people say,

34:15.360 --> 34:17.440
I had to pay my student loans,

34:17.440 --> 34:18.960
so they should too.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.920
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.960
The logic here is,

34:22.960 --> 34:25.200
since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,

34:25.920 --> 34:27.120
no one should.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.520
It's intergenerational envy,

34:29.520 --> 34:31.120
which is a pretty common thing.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.320
Usually older generations envying the young.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.400
Kids these days have it so easy.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.280
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast

34:39.280 --> 34:42.560
and sent text messages on the Pony Express.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.000
The feeling is basically,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.480
it's not fair that kids these days

34:46.480 --> 34:48.960
don't have to suffer like I suffered.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.160
Or think about the concept of a welfare queen,

34:52.160 --> 34:55.440
which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.080
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.400
It's all this envious suspicion

35:00.400 --> 35:03.040
about illegal immigrants sneaking in

35:03.040 --> 35:04.560
and getting government handouts

35:04.560 --> 35:06.240
without having to pay taxes.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.920
I had to work hard for my money,

35:07.920 --> 35:10.320
so why should these people get a free ride?

35:10.320 --> 35:12.080
Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant

35:12.080 --> 35:13.280
is actually like,

35:13.280 --> 35:17.280
except in the imagination of people who envy them.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.800
Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people,

35:20.800 --> 35:24.320
so it's especially sharp when it targets people

35:24.320 --> 35:27.600
who are supposed to be beneath you.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.320
The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin

35:30.320 --> 35:33.120
made what I think is a pretty compelling argument

35:33.120 --> 35:36.400
that both anti-Semitism and misogyny

35:36.400 --> 35:38.240
are partly rooted in envy.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.080
She quotes a bigoted argument

35:40.080 --> 35:42.400
made by the wife-killing protagonist

35:42.400 --> 35:45.280
of Tolstoy's story, The Kreutzer Sonata,

35:45.280 --> 35:47.520
who resents that women and Jews

35:47.520 --> 35:51.520
find a kind of paradoxical power in their own oppression.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.880
Just like the Jews,

35:52.880 --> 35:54.720
as they pay us back for their oppression

35:54.720 --> 35:56.320
by financial domination,

35:56.320 --> 35:57.600
so it is with women.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.080
Ah, you want us to be traitors only?

36:00.240 --> 36:00.880
All right.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.840
As traitors, we will dominate you, say the Jews.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.800
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

36:06.800 --> 36:07.520
All right.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.160
As objects of sensuality, we will enslave you.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.360
Dworkin explains,

36:11.360 --> 36:13.840
This dominance of men by women

36:13.840 --> 36:16.240
is experienced by the men as real,

36:16.240 --> 36:17.520
emotionally real,

36:17.520 --> 36:18.800
sexually real,

36:18.800 --> 36:20.240
psychologically real.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.760
It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.400
The woman appears to control sex.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.760
The man needs it.

36:27.760 --> 36:31.920
This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.880
Women control access to what men want,

36:34.880 --> 36:37.680
which gives women a kind of indirect power

36:37.680 --> 36:39.120
that some men envy.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.000
They envy the sexual power of women.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.320
It doesn't matter to the misogynist that,

36:44.320 --> 36:46.400
especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,

36:46.400 --> 36:50.320
women objectively have less power in society than men.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.640
He envies women because they have what he desires.

36:54.720 --> 36:58.160
Likewise, it didn't matter to Weimar anti-Semites

36:58.160 --> 37:01.200
that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.520
Anti-Semitism is often rooted in an envious obsession

37:05.520 --> 37:08.080
with the disproportionate influence

37:08.080 --> 37:10.320
and affluence of Jewish people.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.640
It is not the absolute differences between men

37:12.640 --> 37:13.600
which feed envy,

37:13.600 --> 37:15.440
but subjective perception,

37:15.440 --> 37:17.040
the optics of envy.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.400
Magic mirror on the wall.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.400
Who's the cuntest of them all?

37:25.200 --> 37:28.960
Thou art cunt, my queen.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.440
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.760
Oh, yes, it's me.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.800
What?

37:38.800 --> 37:41.200
In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning

37:41.200 --> 37:42.640
of this whole transition.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.400
I'm not sure what to expect.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.760
I'm kind of just in the beginning

37:45.760 --> 37:47.200
of this whole transition.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.200
You know, like a young little girl

37:49.200 --> 37:50.960
going through all these things,

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
having a sleepover with the girls.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.480
What do we do on a sleepover?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.480
Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?

37:58.320 --> 38:01.920
Alas, she is more cunt than thee.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.160
My pussy stunting on the Gram has come to nothing.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.720
The classic 1937 Disney movie

38:12.720 --> 38:14.240
Snow White and the Wicked Milf

38:14.240 --> 38:15.680
is the story of a, quote,

38:15.680 --> 38:17.360
vain and wicked queen

38:17.360 --> 38:18.800
who obsessively envies

38:18.800 --> 38:20.640
the beauty of her own stepdaughter.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.200
Are you sure this one's for children?

38:23.200 --> 38:25.120
Every day the milf queen asks the mirror

38:25.120 --> 38:26.720
who is the fairest one of all,

38:26.720 --> 38:27.840
and the mirror responds

38:27.840 --> 38:29.440
that the queen is the fairest,

38:29.440 --> 38:30.800
till one day it says

38:30.800 --> 38:33.120
the stepdaughter Snow White is the fairest,

38:33.120 --> 38:35.440
which sends the queen into an envious fury,

38:35.440 --> 38:38.240
resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.800
So first of all, can we talk plot holes, ding?

38:41.440 --> 38:43.360
Are we really supposed to believe

38:43.360 --> 38:46.320
that this is more beautiful than this?

38:46.880 --> 38:47.920
Uh, ding.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.640
Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.240
What's going on, Walt?

38:52.240 --> 38:53.840
Why don't you take a seat?

38:53.840 --> 38:55.840
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

38:55.840 --> 38:56.560
It's hard to tell

38:56.560 --> 38:59.120
because she's constantly surrounded by manlets,

38:59.120 --> 39:01.120
but she's just so boring,

39:01.120 --> 39:04.400
and the queen is such a baddie.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.240
Step on my throat, mother.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.080
This is a horny video.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.640
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.520
So despite the injustice done to its lead milf,

39:15.520 --> 39:16.720
Snow White does illustrate

39:16.720 --> 39:18.320
some interesting things about envy.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.040
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft

39:21.040 --> 39:22.560
as an expression of envy.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.240
We have the age difference,

39:24.240 --> 39:27.200
intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.600
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women

39:29.600 --> 39:32.160
who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

39:32.160 --> 39:34.000
to rage against Gen Z.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.200
Pretty counterproductive,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.600
since if you're worried about seeming old,

39:37.600 --> 39:39.040
complaining about the youths,

39:39.600 --> 39:41.600
it's probably not helping your case gorge.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.440
You might wonder if there's also jealousy

39:43.440 --> 39:44.960
involved with the evil queen.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.640
Is she worried that the king

39:46.640 --> 39:48.960
is gonna fall in love with his own daughter?

39:48.960 --> 39:50.480
Well, I don't think so,

39:50.480 --> 39:52.000
because we never even see the king.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.200
The queen doesn't mention him.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.120
It's not about the king.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.600
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.000
It's just one woman envying another woman

40:00.000 --> 40:01.920
over beauty for its own sake.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.080
We stan a Bechdel test passing

40:05.440 --> 40:06.880
movie about women hating each other.

40:06.880 --> 40:11.120
Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gas keep, light boss.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.440
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,

40:13.440 --> 40:15.520
the queen first tries killing Snow White

40:15.520 --> 40:17.040
with beauty accessories,

40:17.040 --> 40:18.160
poisoning a comb,

40:18.160 --> 40:20.320
and lacing her to death with a corset.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.920
I wish I could die that way.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.400
What's really striking

40:24.400 --> 40:28.000
is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.120
This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look,

40:31.120 --> 40:34.000
is willing to transform herself with witchcraft

40:34.000 --> 40:36.160
into an ugly old hag,

40:36.160 --> 40:38.960
just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.360
And the queen disguising herself as an old hag

40:41.360 --> 40:44.320
parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.440
I mean, you could actually argue

40:45.440 --> 40:48.160
that the queen is simply a persona of Satan,

40:48.160 --> 40:50.240
it's paradise lost all over again,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.720
which also happens to be the title of my memoir.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.560
The queen is incredibly petty,

40:54.560 --> 40:56.880
because even according to the, again,

40:56.880 --> 40:58.960
wrong and tasteless mirror,

40:58.960 --> 41:02.240
she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.

41:02.240 --> 41:06.160
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy

41:06.160 --> 41:08.560
still be consumed by envy?

41:08.560 --> 41:12.720
Well, basically, because that's how envy works.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.040
It's petty, it's subjective,

41:15.040 --> 41:18.240
and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,

41:18.240 --> 41:21.520
or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.080
So you can be the second best in the world,

41:24.080 --> 41:26.880
and still be obsessively envious

41:26.880 --> 41:30.240
of the one person who may barely even be above you.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.600
In fact, there's studies showing

41:31.600 --> 41:33.280
that Olympic silver medalists

41:33.280 --> 41:35.760
are actually less satisfied with their prize

41:35.760 --> 41:37.280
than bronze medalists,

41:37.280 --> 41:38.960
probably because the bronze medalist

41:38.960 --> 41:41.120
is just happy to be on the podium at all,

41:41.120 --> 41:44.400
while the silver medalist is so close to first,

41:44.400 --> 41:46.720
they can't help but wonder, what if?

41:46.720 --> 41:49.600
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth

41:49.600 --> 41:52.320
not by comparing ourselves to any absolute standard,

41:52.320 --> 41:54.400
but by comparing ourselves to each other,

41:54.400 --> 41:56.320
and we're more likely to compare ourselves

41:56.320 --> 41:58.160
to the people who are around us

41:58.160 --> 42:00.160
than we are to people who are far away.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.520
We could call this the proximity effect of envy.

42:03.520 --> 42:06.480
We're more likely to envy people who are close to us,

42:06.480 --> 42:07.920
or similar to us,

42:07.920 --> 42:10.400
especially people we're in competition with.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.720
That's why social media is such a nightmare.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.400
It's an incubator of envy,

42:14.400 --> 42:17.120
because it puts everyone next to everyone else.

42:17.120 --> 42:20.400
So we're all being compared, all in competition,

42:20.400 --> 42:22.800
and it can destroy your self-esteem,

42:22.800 --> 42:25.360
because you're comparing your actual life

42:25.360 --> 42:27.440
to these idealized images.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.200
And it also turns public figures

42:29.200 --> 42:31.280
into lightning rods for envy,

42:31.280 --> 42:35.200
because of the numeric visibility of popularity and success.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.040
It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect

42:39.040 --> 42:41.920
that envy within an oppressed class

42:41.920 --> 42:44.240
is often more venomous and obsessive

42:44.240 --> 42:45.840
than envy for the oppressor.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.360
So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan,

42:49.360 --> 42:52.000
you have women envying other women,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.800
because women are often in competition with each other.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.120
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

42:57.120 --> 42:59.280
In media, there's constant portrayals

42:59.280 --> 43:01.280
of vain and envious women.

43:01.280 --> 43:04.560
Jealous bitches fighting over men.

43:04.640 --> 43:05.760
Over youth.

43:05.760 --> 43:06.880
Over beauty.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.040
It's like drag queen femininity.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.800
Death becomes her femininity.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.640
-"En garde, bitch!"

43:14.640 --> 43:17.200
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope,

43:17.920 --> 43:20.640
but, how do I put this delicately,

43:20.640 --> 43:22.640
sometimes reality is misogynistic.

43:22.640 --> 43:25.440
Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on!

43:25.440 --> 43:28.240
The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.

43:28.240 --> 43:32.320
In her 1976 essay Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood,

43:32.320 --> 43:35.120
feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism

43:35.120 --> 43:37.040
from within the women's movement.

43:37.040 --> 43:40.160
-"I've been watching for years with increasing dismay

43:40.160 --> 43:43.360
as the movement consciously destroys anyone within it

43:43.360 --> 43:45.280
who stands out in any way."

43:45.280 --> 43:48.560
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.160
-"And who do they attack?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.240
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind

43:52.240 --> 43:54.160
would seem to be the worst crime.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.480
Do anything that every other woman secretly

43:56.480 --> 43:59.200
or otherwise feels she could do just as well,

43:59.200 --> 44:00.400
and you're in for it.

44:00.400 --> 44:03.760
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist,

44:03.760 --> 44:06.720
a ruthless mercenary out to make her fame and fortune

44:06.720 --> 44:09.200
over the dead bodies of selfless sisters

44:09.200 --> 44:11.120
who have buried their abilities

44:11.120 --> 44:13.040
and sacrificed their ambitions

44:13.040 --> 44:15.920
for the greater glory of feminism."

44:15.920 --> 44:17.280
Freeman speculates,

44:17.280 --> 44:21.840
-"The primary reason there have been so few great women blank

44:21.840 --> 44:25.200
is not merely that greatness has been undeveloped

44:25.200 --> 44:26.400
or unrecognized,

44:26.400 --> 44:29.440
but that women exhibiting potential for achievement

44:29.440 --> 44:32.160
are punished by both women and men.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.960
The fear of success is quite rational

44:34.960 --> 44:37.600
when one knows that the consequence of achievement

44:37.600 --> 44:39.840
is hostility and not praise."

44:39.840 --> 44:41.280
So at no point in this essay

44:41.280 --> 44:43.680
does Joe Freeman use the word envy.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.960
But as usual, envy is right below the surface,

44:46.960 --> 44:48.320
causing all the trouble.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.360
So Freeman is describing

44:51.360 --> 44:53.680
how people from marginalized groups,

44:53.680 --> 44:56.800
whose ambition raises them above the typical limits

44:56.800 --> 44:58.480
set by marginalization,

44:58.480 --> 45:01.360
are often ostracized from their own communities.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.720
But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.840
I have an explanation.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.200
The explanation is envy.

45:07.200 --> 45:10.160
And women are more likely to envy other women.

45:10.160 --> 45:13.280
Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.760
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

45:15.760 --> 45:17.200
If we did this topic justice,

45:17.200 --> 45:19.280
this video would be nine centuries long.

45:19.280 --> 45:22.800
-"En garde, bitch!"

45:22.800 --> 45:26.320
A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women,

45:26.320 --> 45:27.760
and there is some truth to that.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.760
There definitely was a time in my life

45:29.760 --> 45:33.200
when I used to envy cis women for being cis women,

45:33.200 --> 45:35.120
but now I kind of just don't even allow myself

45:35.120 --> 45:36.560
to have the thought,

45:36.560 --> 45:38.240
what if I were a cis woman?

45:38.240 --> 45:42.160
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible,

45:42.160 --> 45:43.280
it's unobtainable,

45:43.280 --> 45:45.840
I actually envy cis women less.

45:45.840 --> 45:49.440
So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women

45:49.440 --> 45:51.280
because of the proximity effect,

45:51.280 --> 45:53.520
and because another trans woman

45:53.520 --> 45:56.080
represents an actual possibility

45:56.080 --> 45:58.960
of what I, a trans woman, could become.

45:58.960 --> 46:02.720
She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.600
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.360
Am I the only one who finds it hard

46:07.360 --> 46:08.800
to watch trans creators?

46:08.800 --> 46:10.720
Before I realized I was a trans woman,

46:10.720 --> 46:12.560
I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,

46:12.560 --> 46:14.240
Nyx Fears, and other trans creators.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.320
But ever since I realized I was trans,

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
I just get this angry, resentful feeling

46:18.320 --> 46:19.280
in the pit of my stomach

46:19.280 --> 46:22.000
whenever I get recommended any of these videos.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.760
I seriously loved ContraPoints,

46:23.760 --> 46:25.920
but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,

46:26.320 --> 46:27.520
I just wanna scream.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.480
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

46:30.480 --> 46:33.120
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.480
Am I just a toxic person?

46:34.480 --> 46:38.240
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person,

46:38.240 --> 46:40.400
at least not any worse than anyone else,

46:40.400 --> 46:43.280
it's just that human nature is a toxic person.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.200
And that angry, resentful feeling

46:45.200 --> 46:46.640
in the pit of your stomach

46:46.640 --> 46:48.480
that makes you wanna scream

46:48.480 --> 46:51.360
and feel such a hatred has a name,

46:51.360 --> 46:53.440
and the name is Envy.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.840
I actually admire the person who wrote this post,

46:55.840 --> 46:56.960
because they're doing the best

46:56.960 --> 46:58.640
that any of us can do, really,

46:58.640 --> 47:00.720
which is noticing the feeling

47:00.720 --> 47:02.720
without endorsing the feeling.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.960
I wish that more people could feel things

47:04.960 --> 47:08.320
without rushing to a rational defense of the feeling.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.160
And isn't rationality itself

47:10.160 --> 47:13.520
often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious?

47:13.520 --> 47:16.320
Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.

47:16.320 --> 47:19.600
For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual

47:19.600 --> 47:20.880
who complains that,

47:20.880 --> 47:22.240
when I transitioned,

47:22.240 --> 47:25.040
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping

47:25.040 --> 47:27.360
but kids these days just waltz on in

47:27.360 --> 47:28.960
and walk out with hormones.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.840
It's intergenerational envy, trans edition.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.040
It was hard for me,

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
so it should be hard for everyone,

47:35.040 --> 47:36.640
like the student debt debate.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.760
If I can't have it, no one can.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.920
And look, I do have sympathy and admiration

47:41.920 --> 47:43.120
for older trans people.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.680
Like, being trans in 2021

47:45.680 --> 47:48.720
is already the maximum level of adversity

47:48.720 --> 47:49.760
that I can handle.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.120
I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.800
However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.960
Envy is not sacred rage,

47:58.960 --> 48:01.600
and the malignant demands of envious people

48:01.600 --> 48:03.040
should be ignored.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.240
God, this community.

48:04.240 --> 48:06.080
The constant competition.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.000
The envy, the cringing.

48:08.640 --> 48:10.160
It makes it really hard to get along

48:10.160 --> 48:11.440
with other trans people.

48:11.440 --> 48:12.640
Oh, speaking of which.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.400
Gay tangent, everybody.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.680
Gay tangent.

48:15.680 --> 48:18.240
Envy presents kind of a unique problem

48:18.240 --> 48:20.080
to same-sex attracted people

48:20.080 --> 48:21.920
because of the increased risk

48:21.920 --> 48:24.960
of envying the very people you're attracted to.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.720
I want to f*** the ones I envy.

48:26.720 --> 48:27.920
I envy.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.280
You know, it's the classic

48:29.280 --> 48:32.240
do I want you or do I want to be you problem.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.320
I've heard feminine queer women say

48:34.320 --> 48:36.240
they could never date another femme

48:36.240 --> 48:37.360
because they're worried

48:37.360 --> 48:39.360
they would just end up envying her.

48:39.360 --> 48:42.240
So dating masculine women solves that problem

48:42.240 --> 48:43.920
because having separate roles,

48:43.920 --> 48:45.120
separate aesthetics,

48:45.120 --> 48:46.560
separate categories

48:46.560 --> 48:50.240
helps to avert proximity envy between partners.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.360
Unfortunately, I am not that smart.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.320
Basically, I am attracted to femininity.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.760
But I also want to embody

48:57.760 --> 48:59.840
a kind of feminine archetype myself.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.720
I'm not masculine and I don't want to be.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.440
You know, I used to think

49:03.440 --> 49:05.600
I'd only want to date another trans woman

49:05.600 --> 49:07.440
because of the mutual understanding.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.360
But I've kind of realized that at this point

49:09.360 --> 49:11.520
it may actually be more psychologically healthy

49:11.520 --> 49:13.440
for me to open up to dating cis women.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.960
I used to not want to do that

49:14.960 --> 49:16.960
because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.

49:16.960 --> 49:20.160
But at this point, honestly, just be a man.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.160
Whatever, it's fine.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.400
As a drag queen once said,

49:24.400 --> 49:26.160
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be

49:26.160 --> 49:28.320
and more of a woman than you'll ever have.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.040
Yes, gawd.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.680
Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?

49:31.680 --> 49:33.200
I think at a distance,

49:33.200 --> 49:37.200
it's okay to indulge the attraction emulation ambiguity.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.680
But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone,

49:40.240 --> 49:41.920
you have to make up your mind

49:41.920 --> 49:43.440
that you desire this woman

49:43.440 --> 49:45.600
and you do not want to be her.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.760
Because think about it from the other perspective.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.680
What could be less attractive

49:49.680 --> 49:52.240
than someone who literally wants to be you?

49:52.960 --> 49:56.000
Teacher, make her stop copying me.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.240
Like as much as I joke every episode

49:58.240 --> 50:01.200
about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,

50:02.080 --> 50:03.840
you don't want to date that bitch.

50:03.840 --> 50:07.040
Imagine trying to date Eve from All About Eve.

50:07.040 --> 50:07.520
Pass.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.040
Hard pass.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.760
So if you're a queer woman or a queer anything, honestly,

50:11.760 --> 50:14.160
and you find yourself envying your partner,

50:14.160 --> 50:17.520
my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.160
An enviable woman wanted to be with you.

50:20.160 --> 50:24.160
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.040
I get it though, it's complicated.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.880
You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm

50:28.880 --> 50:30.320
what we truly desire,

50:30.320 --> 50:32.640
but how do you know what you truly desire?

50:32.640 --> 50:33.840
Do I want mommy?

50:34.400 --> 50:36.320
Or do I want to be the mommy?

50:37.200 --> 50:37.700
Yes.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.360
Just yes.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.440
Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.280
The mother half took over completely.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.640
Do I look okay?

50:54.640 --> 50:55.760
Is my hat on straight?

50:56.480 --> 51:01.120
So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.

51:01.120 --> 51:04.000
And people especially cannot seem to notice

51:04.000 --> 51:06.560
when they themselves are feeling envious.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.920
Like that person who puzzled over the angry resentful feeling

51:09.920 --> 51:11.120
in the pit of their stomach

51:11.120 --> 51:13.600
without being able to name what they were feeling.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.920
There's two reasons why people are usually in denial

51:15.920 --> 51:17.120
about their own envy.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.280
One is guilt, and the other is shame.

51:20.240 --> 51:20.740
Shame.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.800
Shame because admitting to yourself that you envy someone

51:24.800 --> 51:27.520
implies that you feel inferior to them,

51:27.520 --> 51:28.720
which is shameful.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.400
It wounds the ego.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.440
And guilt because envy is malicious.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.720
If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable

51:36.720 --> 51:38.880
about their success and good fortune,

51:38.880 --> 51:41.840
and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.080
That's cruel and antisocial.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.480
It goes against most ideas of morality,

51:46.480 --> 51:48.160
and it's a thought that's usually

51:48.160 --> 51:50.480
not socially acceptable to admit.

51:50.480 --> 51:55.040
So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable.

51:55.040 --> 51:58.720
And we deal with that by suppressing it from our awareness.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.240
But it is still there.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.400
And in order to maintain the denial,

52:02.400 --> 52:06.160
we have to convince ourselves that this angry resentful feeling

52:06.160 --> 52:09.680
in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.680
Think about how in Spongebob,

52:11.680 --> 52:15.360
Squidward shows contempt for Spongebob's childishness,

52:15.360 --> 52:18.240
for blowing bubbles, for having fun at work,

52:18.240 --> 52:22.800
when in fact, Squidward envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy

52:22.800 --> 52:24.480
and intuitive creativity.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.960
But he can't allow himself to have the thought

52:26.960 --> 52:28.720
that he envies Spongebob,

52:28.720 --> 52:30.640
because that would mean recognizing

52:30.640 --> 52:33.040
the intolerably shameful truth

52:33.120 --> 52:36.000
that he feels inferior to Spongebob.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.240
So what he does instead is convince himself

52:38.240 --> 52:41.840
that what he really is, is a refined sophisticate,

52:41.840 --> 52:44.080
scoffing at this childish fool.

52:44.080 --> 52:47.680
How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors?

52:49.680 --> 52:53.200
We could call this envy-to-contempt sublimation.

52:53.200 --> 52:56.080
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term,

52:56.080 --> 52:59.520
which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling

52:59.520 --> 53:01.440
or socially unacceptable longing

53:02.080 --> 53:05.600
into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.000
So the classic example used by Freud

53:08.000 --> 53:10.560
is the transformation of sexual urges,

53:10.560 --> 53:14.240
of erotic energy, into creative expression.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.480
It's like the founder of the NoFap movement,

53:16.480 --> 53:18.160
Lady Gaga, once said,

53:18.160 --> 53:20.720
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,

53:20.720 --> 53:23.040
they're gonna take my creativity from me through my...

53:23.920 --> 53:25.200
So according to Freud,

53:25.200 --> 53:28.080
the vast majority of erotic longings

53:28.080 --> 53:29.600
can never be fulfilled.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.960
Tell me about a segment...

53:30.960 --> 53:32.480
Ugh, misery.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.680
But there's a positive side to this, supposedly,

53:35.680 --> 53:38.720
which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings

53:38.720 --> 53:41.520
into a more socially acceptable productivity.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.840
So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,

53:43.840 --> 53:47.280
maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires,

53:47.280 --> 53:49.680
or for that matter, philosophical treatises

53:49.680 --> 53:50.880
about the will to power.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.400
Oh, we'll get to you.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.640
Freud thought that civilization itself

53:54.640 --> 53:56.800
is built at the cost of our instincts,

53:56.800 --> 53:58.960
most of which we have to sacrifice

53:58.960 --> 54:00.640
in order to live in a society.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.560
So like erotic impulses,

54:02.560 --> 54:04.720
I think envy can be sublimated,

54:04.720 --> 54:07.520
which is what's happening when it becomes contempt.

54:07.520 --> 54:10.480
Another example is the blog McMansion Hell,

54:10.480 --> 54:12.800
which makes fun of the tasteless architecture

54:12.800 --> 54:15.200
of suburban ostentatious trash.

54:15.200 --> 54:18.000
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog

54:18.000 --> 54:23.200
is the pleasure and relief of looking down at the rich.

54:23.200 --> 54:25.760
Because looking enviously up at the rich

54:25.760 --> 54:28.800
is painful, it makes you feel inferior.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.800
And a way to alleviate that pain

54:30.800 --> 54:33.360
is to sublimate envy and pretend

54:33.360 --> 54:35.840
that you're an aristocratic aesthete

54:35.840 --> 54:39.440
scoffing at the vulgar taste of the era of East.

54:39.440 --> 54:43.520
These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.

54:43.520 --> 54:46.800
Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.320
I once heard a trans woman say,

54:48.320 --> 54:51.360
at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.400
The subtext is,

54:52.400 --> 54:54.640
there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer

54:54.640 --> 54:57.520
who lives in LA and has a lot of cosmetic surgery

54:57.520 --> 54:59.680
to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.080
But it costs a lot of money to look like this.

55:02.080 --> 55:04.160
And a lot of trans women can't afford

55:04.160 --> 55:05.760
surgeries that they want.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.920
And one way to cope with frustrated desire

55:08.480 --> 55:10.240
is to convince yourself that the thing

55:10.240 --> 55:13.760
that's out of reach is not worth having anyway.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.680
See also the discourse on Twitter

55:15.680 --> 55:17.760
about how passing is transphobic.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.200
There's an ancient Greek fable

55:19.200 --> 55:20.800
where a fox wants some grapes,

55:20.800 --> 55:22.400
but he can't reach the vine.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.400
So he walks away bitterly and says,

55:24.400 --> 55:26.720
well the grapes are transphobic anyway.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.880
The cisgender version of this is maybe

55:28.880 --> 55:30.720
the not-like-other-girls meme,

55:30.720 --> 55:33.360
which is classic envy-to-contempt sublimation.

55:33.360 --> 55:36.080
The trope is usually that other girls

55:36.080 --> 55:37.600
are popular and slutty.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.920
They have fake tans and fake nails.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.680
They like partying and makeup

55:41.680 --> 55:44.000
and stupid music for idiots.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.760
But I'm quirky and real.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.720
I listen to Pink Floyd and read books

55:48.720 --> 55:51.280
and eat lots of pizza late at night,

55:51.280 --> 55:53.120
alone and sad.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.440
There's usually a subtext of anxiety

55:55.440 --> 55:56.800
about inferiority,

55:56.800 --> 55:59.600
the other girls being more socially accepted,

55:59.600 --> 56:01.200
feminine, and put together.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.280
A lot of times the other girls

56:03.280 --> 56:04.800
don't even exist, right?

56:04.800 --> 56:07.600
They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.200
Like where are these other girls

56:09.200 --> 56:10.800
who've never eaten pizza

56:10.800 --> 56:13.760
and enjoy wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?

56:13.760 --> 56:15.680
Are they between the sofa cushions?

56:15.680 --> 56:17.760
Did you put them in with the other laundry?

56:17.760 --> 56:20.000
Are the other girls in the room with us right now?

56:20.000 --> 56:21.680
So the feeling of inferiority

56:21.680 --> 56:23.120
toward the other girls

56:23.120 --> 56:25.520
is reframed as a kind of contemptuous

56:25.520 --> 56:27.040
hipster superiority,

56:27.040 --> 56:29.120
which is really just an ego-defensive

56:29.120 --> 56:30.640
persona of resentment.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.320
Like Janice in Mean Girls.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.680
She's not even really a lesbian.

56:33.680 --> 56:34.880
She's Lebanese.

56:34.880 --> 56:35.920
Lebanese.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.440
Regina got confused.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.280
And then she dances with a boy at the end

56:39.280 --> 56:41.280
and is readmitted into girlhood.

56:41.280 --> 56:42.720
Uh, thank you for that Tina Fey,

56:42.720 --> 56:43.600
that's very helpful.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.200
Great.

56:45.200 --> 56:46.880
Another way we can reframe

56:46.880 --> 56:49.200
feelings of envious inferiority

56:49.200 --> 56:52.960
is by transforming them into moral superiority.

56:52.960 --> 56:56.000
Moral superiority often being the refuge

56:56.000 --> 56:58.640
of people with nothing better to feel superior about.

56:58.640 --> 57:01.760
We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy

57:01.760 --> 57:03.120
if we convince ourselves

57:03.120 --> 57:05.360
that what we're actually experiencing

57:05.360 --> 57:08.400
is justified, legitimate hatred.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.600
So for example,

57:09.600 --> 57:12.320
think of the morality around sexuality.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.920
Part 69.

57:13.920 --> 57:14.560
Sluts.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.240
Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

57:16.240 --> 57:16.880
Cancel me?

57:17.520 --> 57:18.160
En garde!

57:19.760 --> 57:20.320
Bitch!

57:20.320 --> 57:22.480
Why does everyone hate sluts so much?

57:22.480 --> 57:24.640
Sluts never did nothing wrong to nobody.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.120
Open sexual promiscuity is in a way

57:27.120 --> 57:28.880
analogous to opulence.

57:28.880 --> 57:31.120
You're conspicuously enjoying something

57:31.120 --> 57:34.480
that other people want but may not be able to get.

57:34.480 --> 57:37.040
Many cultures have norms about modesty,

57:37.040 --> 57:38.480
for example expecting women

57:38.480 --> 57:40.240
to cover their hair in public.

57:40.240 --> 57:42.000
This is usually explained as

57:42.000 --> 57:44.240
prophylaxis against male lust,

57:44.240 --> 57:45.840
but I wonder if it also serves

57:45.840 --> 57:48.640
to prevent a more generalized envy,

57:48.640 --> 57:51.520
which female beauty has a way of attracting.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.360
Men often slut shame

57:53.360 --> 57:55.840
because they want to control female sexuality.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.840
And by female sexuality,

57:57.840 --> 57:59.920
I do mean male sexuality,

57:59.920 --> 58:02.640
because often what they're really struggling to control

58:02.640 --> 58:04.080
is their own desire.

58:04.080 --> 58:06.080
But slut shaming is also done

58:06.080 --> 58:08.800
pretty viciously by women to each other.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.560
And that's a complicated thing.

58:10.560 --> 58:11.920
It's more than just envy.

58:11.920 --> 58:13.280
Sometimes it comes from a sense

58:13.360 --> 58:16.720
that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men

58:16.720 --> 58:18.720
is compromising the collective

58:18.720 --> 58:21.040
sex-withholding power of the group,

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
almost like she's crossing a picket line.

58:23.040 --> 58:25.440
But there's also sometimes a resentment

58:25.440 --> 58:27.760
that a woman who's showing skin

58:27.760 --> 58:31.440
is using her body to get unearned attention.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.600
And that smells like envy to me.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.840
I don't use my body to get attention,

58:36.720 --> 58:38.000
so no one should.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.520
The repressed feeling is

58:39.520 --> 58:41.040
maybe I'm a little jealous

58:41.040 --> 58:42.720
that she's getting all this attention

58:42.720 --> 58:44.240
by posting thirst traps,

58:44.240 --> 58:45.920
but you don't think that.

58:45.920 --> 58:46.880
You think,

58:46.880 --> 58:48.880
I am above this

58:48.880 --> 58:51.120
because I am chaste.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.880
I have class.

58:52.880 --> 58:54.960
I am a feminist.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.400
I would also suggest accusing her

58:56.400 --> 58:58.480
of pandering to the male gaze.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.080
That's, of course, the feminist way

59:00.080 --> 59:03.440
of calling someone a low-down hobag skank.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.400
So again, we have envy to contempt sublimation,

59:06.400 --> 59:10.240
and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.520
The psychological need to convince ourselves

59:13.520 --> 59:17.440
that envy is morality can become so strong

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
that we actually start inventing things

59:19.440 --> 59:21.200
to be outraged about.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.840
Take, for instance, the tendency to imagine

59:23.840 --> 59:25.280
that the wealthy and powerful

59:25.280 --> 59:28.240
are enjoying wild satanic orgies

59:28.240 --> 59:31.440
and indulging all the forbidden salacious pleasures

59:31.440 --> 59:33.520
that we ourselves are denied.

59:33.520 --> 59:36.560
Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists

59:36.560 --> 59:38.720
who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton

59:39.280 --> 59:41.600
reclining in a garden of earthly delights,

59:42.240 --> 59:45.360
sampling the pleasures of Ephibes.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.640
Live, laugh, love that for her.

59:48.640 --> 59:50.960
Envy is very imaginative when it comes

59:50.960 --> 59:54.000
to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.880
the queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.520
If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette,

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.680
it's probably that when she heard about a famine

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.440
where the people had no bread,

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.880
she infamously responded,

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.880
let them eat cake.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.440
What an evil bitch.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.120
How could she say that?

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.240
Well, she didn't.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.520
She never said it.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.560
It's a lie.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.480
The phrase let them eat cake,

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.560
originally let them eat brioche,

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.800
first appeared in Rousseau's Confessions,

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.360
written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.120
Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.600
Probably no one ever said this.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600
It's kind of like how the most famous photo

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.240
of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.720
a Stop Being Poor t-shirt.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.320
What an evil bitch.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.000
How could she wear that?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Well, she didn't.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.360
It's photoshopped.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.560
The actual shirt said Stop Being Desperate.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.000
Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.040
of its enemies.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.000
I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.520
I mean, what is a Disney villain

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.440
if not an opulent homosexual

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.280
seen through the eyes of the envious?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.640
See how I do it?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.080
I'm gonna try lowering the ISO

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.680
because it's so f***ing bright in here now.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.640
Okay, well it's a much lower ISO.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.240
What if I get another white over here?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.600
That's what this channel is really about,

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.520
one biological female's quest

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.920
to create a harmonious color story.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.280
In the years leading up to

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280
and during the French Revolution,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.080
Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.360
in these sleazy tabloids called libelles.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.600
It's the same root as the English word libel.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.640
The often pornographic libelles depicted the queen

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.320
as a bisexual demon

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.560
who was constantly having drunken orgies

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.960
and sexually manipulating everyone around her.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.200
All of which is very interesting,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.360
but none of which is true.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.680
The historian Robert Darnton called it

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.760
an avalanche of defamation

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.200
that has no parallel in the history of vilification.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.360
This woman took the blame,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.040
the moral blame,

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.720
for the structural failings of a broken economic system.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.000
And by the time she was brought

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.360
before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793,

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.600
the actual person Marie Antoinette

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.680
had long ago been overshadowed

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.760
by the libellous caricature of her.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.240
Now there was maybe one good reason

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.080
for executing the former queen,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.120
which is that the legitimacy of your new republic

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.800
is a little more secure

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.000
when you don't have living monarchs hanging around.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.520
Someone better tell the English.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.280
But the problem with that reasoning

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.960
is it has nothing to do

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.240
with whether or not the queen deserved to die.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.960
And beheading a recently widowed mother of two

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.080
in front of a jeering crowd for political expediency

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.120
might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.360
So the Revolution had to convince themselves

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.600
that the queen deserved it,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.920
which was pretty easy after decades of,

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.800
again, false and defamatory gossip.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.120
In her biography of Marie Antoinette,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.200
Antonia Fraser describes

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.520
how the prison guards separated Marie

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.120
from her eight-year-old son,

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.960
who they plied with alcohol

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.760
and groomed into accusing his own mother

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.520
of incestuous abuse.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.480
To justify killing Marie Antoinette,

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.640
they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a mother.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.360
So she was convicted of what may as well have been

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.160
crimes against ethics in games journalism,

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.680
and sent to the guillotine,

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.200
where her last words were

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.560
sorry to the executioner for stepping on his foot.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.800
A women-stop-apologizing challenge.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.120
This is what a girlboss winning looks like.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.880
So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.440
Hey, how are you?

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.480
An innocent milf was killed that day,

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.200
and I, for one, won't stand for it.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.600
So look, we have a psychological incentive

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.760
to believe that people whom we envy are immoral monsters,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.480
because then we get to label our hatred and violence

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.160
toward them justice.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.800
Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty,

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.640
and part of the reason for that

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.720
is that calling cruelty what it is

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.040
takes the fun out of it.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.520
It reminds me of the second best day

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.200
in the history of Twitter,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.120
October 1st, 2020,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.360
the day that Trump got COVID.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.800
And I'm gonna be honest,

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.400
I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.120
Well, well, well.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.920
If it isn't the leopards-eating-people's-faces party

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.000
having their faces eaten by leopards.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.040
It's the last time I eat cake.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.400
Like Dan Savage said,

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.720
it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.080
The next day, I tweeted,

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.000
these last 24 hours have been the first time

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.320
I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years,

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.720
because this website is good for one thing only,

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.280
reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.200
And someone responded to that saying,

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.560
oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.320
But why was I being a killjoy?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.120
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.960
Well, for most people,

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.920
I guess not me,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.600
but for normal people,

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.800
for other girls,

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.400
cruelty is only pleasurable

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.160
as long as they can convince themselves

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.240
it's something other than cruelty.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.760
Justice served.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.720
So again, reason, rationality,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.840
are often the attempt to publicly communicate,

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.800
to evangelize our private feelings.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.920
And morality, ethics, and justice

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.520
are often put forward

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.240
as the respectable public face

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.400
of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.440
But is this a corruption of morality?

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.240
Or have we stumbled onto something darker?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.400
What if morality itself

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.480
is simply the expression

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.040
of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.680
It's too early for this.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.320
I mean, it's literally 7 a.m. where I'm filming.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.000
I don't know how this keeps happening to me.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.920
My head gets cut off one afternoon.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.080
Puts me in a philosophical mood.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.320
Next morning, I've stayed up all night

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.160
and I'm still talking about the philosophes.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.680
Meow meow.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.040
Hello again, kittens.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.960
Let's talk about justice, uwu.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.440
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.560
Sonia?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.840
Soda meow your?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.320
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.920
if I wasn't being Natalie.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.720
Look, I've been seeing a lot of comments lately

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.760
along the lines of,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.040
Natalie used to do serious academic arguments.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.880
Now she only cares about makeup.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.120
All right, you little shits.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.640
You want book learning?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.000
I'm gonna learn you so hard.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.200
I'm gonna learn you so hard

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.880
you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.240
Friedrich Nietzsche.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.560
Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.000
Do you mind if I call you Fred?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Friedrich was a German philosopher

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.040
who had a lot to say about envy and morality.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.080
But before we get into that,

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.920
I want to say a little bit about his life,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.000
because it's just very funny.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.720
Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch,

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.640
but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful little Friedrich,

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.840
he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.080
Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain,

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.760
nearly blind incel,

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.760
who probably slept with a prostitute once

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.160
and got syphilis and died.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.160
Life is funny.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.520
Sad, but funny.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.560
In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil,

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.920
the editor says,

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.480
though he prided himself on being comfortable with women,

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.400
he does not seem to have been very successful

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.440
in establishing emotionally satisfying relationships with them,

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.880
which is hardly surprising.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.840
Ah!

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.200
I love when the introduction to a book

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.360
is just a brutal roast of the author.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.240
Who wrote this?

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.760
Rolf Peter Horstmann.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.880
You're killing it, Rolf.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.840
You're savage.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.640
I adore.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.720
Friedrich's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.680
What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated,

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.400
highly neurotic man who had to try hard

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.040
to avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.080
Oh.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.640
He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable,

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.120
and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping pills

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.120
using the name Dr. Nietzsche.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.800
Dr. Nietzsche?

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.200
Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.120
Behind a Dairy Queen.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.800
Nietzsche was also a failed musician,

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.600
and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's wife.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.760
The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.720
You beta cuck.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.120
Why did I do that?

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.360
Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360
is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360
I just wanna mom this guy, honestly.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.280
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.960
His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.320
You know, I think it's interesting

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.240
that a person this pathetic

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.040
can also be a genius whose name will never die.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.720
He's someone who had a lot of reason

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.560
to be envious and self-pitying,

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.600
but his philosophy couldn't be more against that.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.160
And as a person of pathetic experience myself,

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.720
that is unironically kind of inspiring to me.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.160
So let's go in.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.040
In his book on the genealogy of morality,

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.440
Frederick wants to explain the origin

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.520
of the concepts of good and evil.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.520
Under what conditions did man invent

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.200
the value judgments good and evil,

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.600
and what value do they themselves have?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.800
Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.080
Hang on, my food's here.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.240
That's right, you're getting a mukbang, sweetie.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.080
Did you think I was gonna sit at this giant table

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.280
and not be eating something?

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.880
This video's been going on more than an hour,

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.640
so I assume you guys are drunk by now,

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.800
and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.000
You guys can't even see.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.400
Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi,

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.000
and it's my mission to eat all of this

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.760
while summarizing the entire life

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.200
and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.400
Trisha Paytas, Nicocado, consider this a challenge.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.280
So Frederick argues that good and bad,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.520
not good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.840
but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.280
of people with power.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.680
So to be good meant to be powerful,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.920
strong, beautiful, healthy,

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.120
and to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.240
I'm gonna eat one like a cat.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.960
And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.160
So in a lot of languages,

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.120
the word that means morally good or spiritually noble

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.880
originally meant noble in the sense of aristocratic,

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.160
the propertied class.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.280
Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani,

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.520
that's Sanskrit for noble truths.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.440
Arya means noble.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.320
And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble,

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.440
but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the rich.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.800
And originally, it was just the name

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.560
that a culture in Northern India gave themselves, the Aryans.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.440
I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.240
This was later misunderstood by Europeans

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.200
who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.960
Oops, goddammit.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.360
Goddammit, kids, can we not?

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.560
Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut,

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.600
or the English good, to the name of the Goths.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.200
No, not those Goths,

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.680
the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.800
Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.080
I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.680
The German word schlecht, which means bad,

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.400
is related to schlicht, which means plain,

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.360
simple, originally common, low,

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.000
not aristocratic, not noble.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.880
So good and bad were originally the values

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.400
of warrior aristocrats,

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.000
who were like Homeric heroes celebrating themselves.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.760
And Frederick calls their value system master morality,

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.960
this glorification of combat, feasting,

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.720
athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.400
These things were called good,

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.840
and their opposites, weakness, impotence,

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840
ugliness, were called bad.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.240
The ancient nobles worshiped noble gods

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.560
who acted like them and shared their values.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560
I mean, if I created a personal goddess,

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560
I think we all know what animal that would be,

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.960
me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.320
So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars,

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.440
the god of war,

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.600
and it was like they were worshiping themselves.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.400
They were dumb jocks worshiping dumb jock gods.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.520
Well, good for them,

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.800
but what about the people who got shoved into lockers?

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.800
Well, Frederick's example,

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.520
and this is gonna create some misunderstandings later,

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.400
but his example is the Jews,

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.200
who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.480
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.520
Oh, they did, multiple times.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.720
But for several centuries,

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.640
the Romans were just too powerful.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.840
No one could stop them.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.120
So the question is,

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.640
what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.360
and who lack the power to overthrow the oppressor?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360
Well, in that case,

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.160
frustrated vindictiveness builds over time

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.160
to become this deep bitterness,

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.160
which Nietzsche gave the French name

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.800
Résentiment, resentment in English.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.600
Oui, eh, eh, oui, absolument, naturellement.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.720
I don't speak French,

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.960
I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.720
M'en, pas, quatre, eh, eh oui.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.520
I don't like the English,

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.960
but I like the French even less.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.240
Because they're always dressed so well

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.240
and they speak a sexier language than me.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:58.880
Stop it.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.640
This is your final warning, comprendez-vous?

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.080
Good wine though, I'll give them that.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.600
So there's a German word, Neid, which means envy.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.360
So why is Frederick using this French term, Résentiment?

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.800
What's going on, Frederick?

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.920
Why are you speaking French?

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.520
Are you nervous?

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.880
Are you trying to impress me?

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880
Nietzsche must have said Résentiment,

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.440
because he thought it was something different than envy.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.440
I think the difference is resentment,

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.640
and I'm just gonna use the English word

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.000
so I don't sound like an asshole,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.160
resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has,

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.320
but of a permanent frustration of the desire for revenge.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.000
It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.960
Now revenge itself implies weakness,

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.720
at least a temporary weakness.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.440
We say revenge is best served cold,

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.640
but actually, revenge is only served cold.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.760
If it's served hot, if someone slaps you

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.440
and you slap them back immediately,

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.920
that's retaliation, not revenge.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.720
You brought this on yourself.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.480
Revenge is only a possibility

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.800
when you can't retaliate immediately,

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.000
so you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.560
But if you're too weak, too impotent

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.160
to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.920
So Nietzsche's argument is that a person

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.560
who's too weak to get material revenge

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.600
can instead get psychological revenge

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.840
by creating a new morality.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.040
In Frederick's words,

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.320
the beginning of the slave's revolt and morality

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.520
occurs when resentment itself turns creative

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.280
and gives birth to values.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.760
This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.800
What are you doing, Frederick?

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.520
So while master morality says that good

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.320
is power, riches, health, and strength,

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320
and bad is the opposite,

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.040
slave morality, the morality of resentment,

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.000
says blessed are the poor, the meek,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.080
the sick, the powerless.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.640
This is the good of slave morality,

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.480
and its opposite is not the bad,

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.040
but a new concept, the evil.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.320
And what is evil?

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.360
Well, everything that master morality says is good.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.240
Power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.320
He's talking about Christianity here,

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.240
he's not talking about Judaism.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.080
But Frederick thinks of Christianity

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.080
as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the Romans,

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.640
an inversion of the empire's values.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.640
But he also thinks that slave morality

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.720
is fundamentally dishonest.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.720
It's like the fox and the grapes.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.960
Not being able to take revenge

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.920
is called not wanting to take revenge.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.400
It might even be called forgiveness.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.320
Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.080
Submission to people you hate is called obedience.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.360
Having to wait is called patience.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.520
Inability to satisfy sexual desire

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.200
is called chastity, purity, and so on.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.960
And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.240
as a powerful, noble beast of prey,

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.480
slave morality is born of saying no to the master

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.640
and everything he has that you can't.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.800
I like to have my belly rubbed.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.280
Scratch my back above my tail, please.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.560
I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.320
because it's getting warm and I'm full.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.080
This has not been a successful mukbang.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.920
It turns out that it's actually very difficult

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.920
to do a mukbang while talking.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.520
I should've thought this through a little harder, hmm.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.960
So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge,

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.920
but that desire for revenge never completely disappears.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.040
It's there, for example,

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.360
in the Christian idea of the last judgment.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.200
No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.640
God will do that for us.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.200
And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.800
I find this book thrilling to read, honestly,

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.480
and I'm not easily thrilled,

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.640
especially not by philosophers.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.240
I think this book in particular gets me

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.880
because, especially if you were raised Christian,

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.440
this is so the opposite of everything

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.640
you were ever taught to believe

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.440
that it almost feels, like, dirty.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.640
Should I be reading this?

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.920
Is this allowed?

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.120
Because even if you're not religious,

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.560
most of us still agree with a lot of Christian morality.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.240
Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.960
Blessed are the meek, sure.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.120
But then Frederick comes along and he's like,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.280
mm, morality is just a cope for frustrated vindictiveness.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.360
And you're like, I need to lie down.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.640
Where's my smelling salts?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:33.680
But wait, there's more.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.040
This gets even darker.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.960
Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.560
of European history, slave morality has triumphed.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.200
St. Paul made Christianity marketable,

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.520
the Emperor Constantine converted,

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.120
and by the Middle Ages,

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.840
even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.120
not to powerful warrior gods made in their own image,

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.880
but to a god that was weak,

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.040
suffering, victimized, oppressed.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.080
So by the 19th century,

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.360
slave morality had become the only morality.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.440
And it's not just Christianity, either.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.600
The secular version of these values

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.000
became socialism, anarchism.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.560
About free thinkers and atheists,

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.160
Nietzsche has this to say.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.720
We loathe the church, not its poison.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.000
Apart from the church, we too love the poison.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.280
Okay, the poison.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.360
What is the poison?

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.440
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind,

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.640
and turns humans against our own natural instincts.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.080
Not just against aggression,

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.080
but against sexuality,

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.360
against ambition,

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.720
against power,

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.480
against life itself.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.560
And there's two possible outcomes of this.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.160
One is that resentment becomes a political movement,

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.560
the conspiracy of those who suffer,

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.320
the tyranny of the herd,

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.720
the revolution that eats itself.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.440
Only we are good and just, is what they say.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.160
As though health, success, strength, pride,

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.360
and the feeling of power were in themselves depravities

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.120
for which penance, bitter penance,

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.720
will one day be exacted.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.520
Among them, we find plenty of vengeance seekers

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.200
disguised as judges,

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.440
with the word justice continually in their mouth

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.040
like poisonous spittle.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.720
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob,

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.480
which I'm sure we're all familiar with.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.160
The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward,

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.560
and attacks the individual conscience,

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.480
producing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.240
Because slave morality condemns

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.840
not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing us,

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.040
but also the beast of prey within,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.880
our own animal instincts,

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.960
what Christianity calls sin.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.440
So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.160
We hate ourselves, we hate our own nature,

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.640
we hate life itself.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.720
I mean, is he wrong?

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.160
You see a girl boss winning,

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.800
I only see the will to power.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.200
Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.920
who've become domesticated house pets,

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.120
at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.880
That's very valid, Frederick.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.800
That's super hecking valid.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.600
So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far,

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.840
but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.280
One is that Frederick associating slave morality

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.000
with the Jews is very irresponsible.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.240
Even though he didn't intend to be antisemitic,

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.720
and even though he was outspoken against antisemitism

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.600
in his own time,

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.000
when you keep referring to the Christian values

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.760
you're critiquing as Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge,

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.480
some people might get the wrong idea.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.080
And some people did, Frederick.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.560
Like your dumbass sister, Elizabeth Nietzsche,

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.040
who became a literal alternative ethno-identitarian.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.160
God damn it, Liz.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.760
Kind of goth goals, though.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.280
Yes, that kind of goth.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.240
You're right this time.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.480
My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.760
to Frederick that genuinely caring about other people

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.720
is an option.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.560
Like not because caring about other people

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.040
is repressing your true selfish nature,

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.280
but just because caring about other people

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.880
is part of your nature.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.000
And isn't it?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.960
Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.920
I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.720
accurately describes a very real thing.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.560
But it's not the only thing.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.440
There is genuine care and love in this world,

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.320
I've been told.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.440
I've heard rumors.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.200
And I'm even gonna go so far as to say

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.120
hashtag not all Christians.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.720
Christ, I'm defending the Christians.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.240
What is this channel coming to?

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.720
There are Christians, maybe not most,

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.080
but still some, for whom love and forgiveness

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.000
are genuine experiences,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.640
and not just some kind of twisted,

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.360
impotent, passive-aggressive vengeance.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.920
Where I agree with Nietzsche, and with Freud,

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.720
is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.560
of justice and morality is retribution,

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.840
envy, or some combination of the two.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.000
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.920
There's a famous Martin Luther King quote

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.440
responding to Nietzsche.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.680
What is needed is a realization

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.080
that power without love is reckless and abusive,

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.520
and that love without power is sentimental and anemic.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.720
Power at its best is love

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.320
implementing the demands of justice,

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.720
and justice at its best is love correcting everything

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.320
that stands against love.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.000
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.800
that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.040
But there still needs to be some kind of emotional

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.440
or spiritual force that keeps humanity

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.120
from tearing itself apart.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.760
And maybe something like this Christian idea

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.160
of love for humanity is the missing piece.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.000
Because without something like that,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.440
I just see retribution and envy snowballing

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.280
into human self-destruction.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.720
And I hate that for us.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.320
It's not very sliving of us.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.600
Do you guys know about sliving?

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.160
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.000
She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do,

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.720
but you know, I try to support smaller creators.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.240
Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.040
into one word.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.000
It's the new that's hot.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.160
Maybe I'll do a video about love

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.680
when I'm in a better mood.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.960
So for now, well, let's put it this way.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.240
God is dead, and we have killed him, yeah?

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:21.760
Sliving!

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.320
Sliving!

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.040
Okay, I'm moisturized.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:41.920
I'm primed.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.000
I've proven my academic credentials.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.520
Now it's time to do my makeup.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.480
That's right, children.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.320
I'm going full Bailey Sarian.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.720
I'm going full suspish.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.080
So I guess I should say something

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.320
about the political implications of all this,

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.120
since I guess this channel is about politics.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.440
Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.280
to remember what I'm doing with my life.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.520
So this morality of resentment,

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.720
of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.240
judges that power is evil.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.200
I don't use foundation.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.400
I just use concealer.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.480
I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup,

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.080
but I don't need to be good at makeup, okay?

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.160
I have a million subscribers on YouTube.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.680
I don't need to be good.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.960
There was a New York Times article

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.760
about young women's attitudes toward political ambition,

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.760
and one of the women who was interviewed said,

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.200
as a white woman, I know I have unearned privilege.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.240
So am I really the best person to be in leadership?

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.840
Uh, yes.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.560
Yes, you are.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.400
Because we need leaders like you

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.240
who are capable of questioning

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.320
the legitimacy of their own authority.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.160
Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.160
with another blonde beast of prey.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.120
And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege,

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.480
especially as a leader,

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.640
but let's not be so self-effacing

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.360
that we efface ourselves off the face of the earth.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.880
This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.800
If you think power is evil,

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.920
then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.960
which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance,

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.640
since, like MLK said,

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.800
you have to at least have some power

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.040
to implement the demands of justice.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.080
Remember what incels call taking the black pill,

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.800
this conviction that the reason you don't have a girlfriend

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.200
is just that you're genetically undesirable.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.880
There's nothing you can do to change it,

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.440
and I guess women are just too shallow

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.080
to be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.760
that festers in your heart.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.520
For a lot of black-pilled incels,

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.760
it seems like there's only one thing left in life

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.720
that they enjoy,

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.000
which is simply the pleasure of complaining,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.760
of moaning in pain.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.960
It reminds me of a comment from Dostoevsky's

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.640
second most horrible protagonist.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:57.680
The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain,

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.320
and part of the satisfaction of moaning

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.120
is inflicting your pain on other people.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.040
This kind of malignant moaning,

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.680
it's kind of the opposite of music,

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.000
because a lot of music, like blues,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.840
is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.360
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.800
My woman don't love me no more,

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.240
but I know her sister will.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.840
You know, optimism.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.520
I think a lot of incel discourse

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.920
is really just malignant moaning, right?

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.280
It's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.760
It's just a contagious expression of misery,

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.680
a moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.760
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.760
The redistribution of sex.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.840
State-mandated GFs.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.760
That's very valid.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.240
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.320
That's not the point.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.680
So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.320
It's very easy to point and laugh at them,

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.720
but what's harder is to look in the mirror

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.440
and notice how these exact same tendencies

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.520
are rampant in our own communities.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.000
So the incel black pill is just one instance

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.800
of what I call an ideology of resentment,

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.800
a discourse that outwardly appears

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.640
like moral or political critique,

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.560
but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.320
The goal of resentment politics

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.400
is not to improve conditions.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.000
In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.200
for any morally compromised sellouts

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.840
who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.360
They don't want victory.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.560
They don't want power.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.360
They want to endlessly critique power.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.000
Because for them, critique is an important

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.560
psychological defense against feeling impotent.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.240
Schaler described it this way.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.800
It is peculiar to resentment criticism

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.400
that it does not seriously desire

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.000
that its demands be fulfilled.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.600
It does not want to cure the evil.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.320
The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.920
What am I going to do with my eyes?

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.840
I think a pink kind of look.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.280
We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.280
I just, I love that hay fever look.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.720
As a general rule,

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.000
the more radical a political community claims to be,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.280
the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.200
Self-styled radicals will tell you

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.400
superficial surface reforms do not interest us.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.120
The problem must be critiqued at its root.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.920
And then the root turns out to be this universal,

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.000
all-encompassing evil, right?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.520
Society itself.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.480
The system.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.520
The machine.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.320
A resentment ideologue always imagines himself

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.440
to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.880
against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880
Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.640
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.000
It's hard to talk while doing this.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.320
And nothing short of total revolution

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.560
counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.880
We have to dismantle the entire system.

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.880
Burn it all down.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.960
I guess it's pedestrian to point out

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.760
that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.840
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.840
Our kingdom is coming, comrades.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.480
Often the appeal of utopian ideology

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.920
is similar to religion.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.200
It's not about healthcare, higher wages,

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.360
relief from police violence.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.240
Those are actual goals that could be demanded,

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.760
worked for, and achieved.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.040
Utopian ideology instead promises relief

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.360
from some general malaise, alienation.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.560
And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.640
that Marx ascribes to religion.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.080
But release from the general anguish of human existence

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.680
is not a political goal.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.800
There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries,

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.440
and so far, zero utopias.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.280
Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.640
are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.440
When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.240
And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.240
And because of the proximity effect,

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.200
envy may actually increase after the revolution.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.560
You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade,

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.320
a successful citoyen, oui, a kulak,

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.400
than you ever were of the aristocrats.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.840
So envy turns paranoid and imaginative

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.600
in revolutionary moments.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.240
It gets sublimated into morality,

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.720
and the accusations start flying.

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.680
That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:15.680
That peasant is hoarding grain.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.720
So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.160
the gulags fill up.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.120
For an authoritarian, strongman takes over

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:26.560
just to announce another revolution two decades later.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.440
The things people will do to stay relevant, honestly.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.240
And for what?

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.840
What long-term egalitarian utopia results?

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.000
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.800
So look, I do understand that sometimes

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.400
you just have to do a revolution.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.240
And if I'd been there in 1789,

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.120
I'm sure I'd be storming the Bastille myself.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.600
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.280
Revolution is a bloody nightmare

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.440
that happens because society is collapsing

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.720
and people are desperate.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.120
At worst, revolution is nothing more

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.120
than a violent day of retribution.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.960
And at best, it lays the groundwork

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.040
for future incremental progress.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.960
But it will never usher in utopia,

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.280
nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.800
which, I'm sorry to report,

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.640
is simply the resting state of an unsedated human mind.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.000
Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.960
that all leftist or all egalitarian politics

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.240
is born of envy.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:20.740
No.

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:23.200
This is a specific subtype.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.960
There are plenty of reasons,

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.120
other than envy or fear of envy,

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.280
to oppose an economic distribution

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.440
where some people have billions of dollars

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.640
while other people are dying

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.160
because they can't afford insulin.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.360
Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.880
to promote human well-being.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.000
And personally, I just don't want to live in a country

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.560
where people are dying because they can't afford medicine.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.360
And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.880
for that not to happen.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.320
So while I'm putting down strawman versions of my argument,

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.080
I'm also not saying,

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.240
oh, let's just stop being envious.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:56.820
No.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.080
That's impossible.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.000
I think envy is like libido.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.160
It's a basic force of human nature

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.400
that's more or less unstoppable.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.920
But with the right leadership,

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.520
I think that envy can potentially be sublimated

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.640
or redirected into something more constructive.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.920
Because raw envy is a very bad basis

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.600
for egalitarian politics.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.360
It often targets the wrong people,

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.280
like millionaires instead of billionaires,

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.080
and eventually it turns the revolution against itself

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.000
and you get the circular firing squad.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.440
The self-cannibalism.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.680
The problem I see on the left today

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.160
is that without any genuine political outlet,

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.040
resentment mostly manifests as morality.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.840
Morality itself being a way to vent

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.840
envious aggression and vindictiveness.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.480
On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.800
We're all about structural analysis,

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.800
the material conditions,

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.240
systems of power,

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.640
intersectional identity hierarchies.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.760
But if you look at what people

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760
actually spend their time doing here,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.480
it's all this obsessive moral policing.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.120
I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.040
on any major political stage,

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.560
we feel disempowered.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.640
And so this moral fanaticism

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.800
is a psychological substitute.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.400
Like with Marie Antoinette,

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.120
it's easier to blame people than systems.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:14.480
Also, structural analysis is very boring,

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.320
and destroying people with gossip

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.920
is extremely entertaining.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.880
This obsessive moral policing

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.560
also gets turned inward

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.400
and becomes leftist guilt.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.760
You know, this useless internalized scolding.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.120
I think I'm done with my makeup.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.000
What do we think?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.800
Leave a comment.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.960
I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.240
since last time I did skincare,

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.760
I was critiqued by Hyram.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.760
So I am going to spray my face a couple times

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.400
with this Tatcha skin mist,

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.000
if that's okay with Hyram.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.840
It feels good to finally address this feud.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.560
Clear the air.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.760
I look a lot better with makeup.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.600
I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.360
it's just that it's very much enhanced

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.400
by painting a different face on top of my face.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.320
But hey, at least this way I've kind of like,

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.600
I've kind of earned it, you know,

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.800
because it's my skill.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.120
So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.640
that's been running for years,

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.840
and I haven't listened in a while,

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.120
but in the early episodes,

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.320
they'd bring on these women

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.960
who would confess their feminist sins.

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:09.760
You know,

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.040
hi, my name is Amber,

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.120
I'm a feminist,

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.080
but I enjoy being choked in bed.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.560
It's hard being a woman.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.160
Not only are you being choked,

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.920
you also feel guilty about it.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.000
The same moral hand-wringing

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.840
happens with body positivity.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.360
When you make loving your body

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.280
into a moral imperative,

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.360
not only are you still going to hate your body,

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.440
but now you're also going to feel guilty

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.640
about hating your body

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.400
because it makes you a bad feminist.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.840
So there was one problem,

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.360
and now there's two problems.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.640
Thanks, morality.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.320
That's very helpful.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.160
Now I want to take a moment to acknowledge

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.200
that a lot of conservatives have made some version

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.360
of the argument I'm making in this video.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.480
For example,

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.720
Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.440
have argued that academic postmodernists

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.040
are motivated by resentment.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.320
The argument is that

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.480
deconstructionist literary theory

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.720
is a kind of envious vengeance

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.640
against the beauty and virtuosity

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.400
of canonical great art.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.400
And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.560
A lot of academics are failed artists,

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.320
but I was even more manqué than that.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.240
I've noticed that working class,

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.920
non-academic socialists

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.080
do tend to be more productive

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.440
and more self-advancing,

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.440
involved in unionizing or organizing.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.640
Whereas, it's usually people who went to college.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.160
I went to college!

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.280
Presumably because they had

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.600
middle-class ambitions at some point,

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.000
but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.720
who become the great critiquers of capital.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.320
I mean, I can tell you from experience

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.000
that when I was eating Chef Boyardee

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.280
over my master's degree,

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.360
that's when I was most likely to say things like,

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.280
according to Antonio Gramsci,

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.520
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.320
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.120
manufactures the consent of the civil term.

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.640
Uh, so point taken.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.160
But some conservatives take this argument way too far,

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.000
and try to argue that the entire left

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.320
is nothing but a coalition of resentment.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.840
Like, there's a video on YouTube

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.080
of the philosophy professor Stephen Hicks

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.080
doing a version of the post-modernism

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.520
is resentment argument,

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.640
and in the comments section,

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.160
there's a bunch of people saying,

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.480
this describes Black Lives Matter,

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.200
Antifa, and the Democrats.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.080
Does it, though?

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.600
I mean, any political movement

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.040
is gonna have people in it

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.880
who suffer from resentment poisoning.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.600
But Black Lives Matter, at its core,

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.480
is about the right not to be murdered by police.

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.640
The slogan, Black Lives Matter,

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.840
is an affirmation of the value of black life.

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.800
So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.760
Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.280
was inspired by Nietzsche

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.080
to create the slogan All Power to the People.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:46.800
When we coined the expression All Power to the People,

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.200
we had in mind emphasizing the word power,

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.280
for we recognize that the will to power

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.880
is the basic drive of man,

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.520
but it is incorrect to seek power over people.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.160
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.200
of exploitation and racism for hundreds of years,

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.080
and the black community has its will to power also.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.040
What we seek, however, is not power over people,

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.080
but the power of control of our own destiny.

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.000
That, to me, is a role model

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.840
for how to do identity politics

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.600
without centering resentment.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.880
It's instead an affirmation of self-determination

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.000
and self-respect.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.800
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.640
Whereas if your whole political project

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.160
is defined in the negative,

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.360
then you're allowing yourself

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.960
to be defined by your enemies.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.800
I find feminism is prone to this,

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.800
where even, and in fact especially,

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.560
the most radical feminists

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.120
cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.720
of being the second sex

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.280
and defining themselves against men.

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.240
Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.560
She's the most radical of radical feminists,

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.440
and my first impulse is actually to defend her

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.680
because she's very widely hated,

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.720
and most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.480
Like in that Stephen Hicks video,

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:58.160
Hicks summarizes Dworkin as

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.360
calling all heterosexual males rapists.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.720
Literally in the preface to her most famous book,

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.920
Dworkin says,

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.800
If one's sexual experience has always,

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.920
and without exception, been based on dominance,

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.160
how could one understand that this book

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.720
does not say that all men are rapists

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.800
or that all intercourse is rape?

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.280
Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.800
and I'm just a makeup vlogger,

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.040
but my gut feeling on this one is,

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.400
before criticizing a book,

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.720
maybe read the book.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.600
Just a thought.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.640
Get it together, prof.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.120
You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.240
I mean, there's no shame in that.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.440
It happens to me all the time.

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.400
That being said,

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.000
I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.400
that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.720
What Dworkin does say in this book

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.560
is arguably even more bleak

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.320
than what is falsely attributed to her.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.080
The book is called Intercourse.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.760
She wrote a book called Intercourse.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.680
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.960
I can actually easily imagine that.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.520
Never mind.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.120
So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.040
Penetration, to be specific.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.880
Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.120
invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.040
So it's against the Freudian

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.680
male castration anxiety interpretation,

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:17.520
where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.800
Imagine being afraid of that.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.560
Imagine being afraid of that.

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.120
I'm gonna get a facelift someday

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.240
and I'm gonna look like this.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.680
I'm perfect.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.560
I certainly don't agree with everything she says,

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.040
but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.640
Closer than Freud, anyway.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.400
Think about what men typically say to women during the act.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.680
Do they say,

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.040
Hell, I'm being devoured.

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.800
Never heard that one.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.440
Have you?

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.280
No, usually it's more along the lines of,

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.520
You like that, don't you?

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.400
You little.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.040
Et cetera.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.600
And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded and enjoy it.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.200
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.400
because they're taught to.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.280
But enjoying it, she'd have to say,

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.840
doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.160
So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.920
and some things that are off the fucking rails.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.800
Where she loses me is where she starts getting blackpilled.

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.680
And this book, this is the feminist blackpill.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.280
It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.080
She says,

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.160
Male-dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.320
This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.120
Uh, okay.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.360
So women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.160
We can dream, Andrea.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:35.120
We can dream.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.960
Like most ideology of resentment,

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:40.800
this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.440
that might actually improve the situation of women.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.880
Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence,

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.560
filth, and abjection of it all.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:52.160
I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian,

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.960
but in that second wave political way.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.240
Quoting from the foreword,

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.920
To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.760
In 30 plus years of knowing her,

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.040
I've never heard of a single romance with a woman, not one.

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.600
This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250 page book about sex

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:14.720
that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.840
Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women,

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.960
it's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.840
You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters,

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.120
but I don't think that's true.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.800
I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.600
The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and, uh, Oedipus the King.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.160
It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters,

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.680
because they're stuck with this,

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.400
and love is closer to hatred than neutrality.

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.640
So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.440
What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.360
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.800
because no one ever told them they could.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.240
Romance.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.160
That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:56.400
Joan Didion, of course, being not like other girls.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.600
Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.040
Despite all efforts to socialize women to want intercourse,

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.840
women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.800
that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.000
That does sound nice.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:10.960
I'm so lonely.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.880
I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women, though.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.600
Like, there are definitely women out there who, uh,

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.920
they don't make love, Anastasia.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.160
They f*** hard.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.320
I'm really sleepy, and this bed right behind me just looks so nice.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.920
I can't in here right now.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.480
What if I just go to sleep, and then wake up,

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.880
and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.840
I don't want to do it now.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.000
I'll get Pikachu, that'll make this easier.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.440
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.600
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.080
Why?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.440
Because he's the yellowest.

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.600
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.320
You can't name anything.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.360
You can't think of anything.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.120
So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.320
then just say that.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.680
Is that what you want, Pikachu?

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.680
I bet it is.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.200
And Dworkin did get married.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.120
To a gay man.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.960
So I guess she found what she wanted.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.240
Lucky.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.640
Envying Andrea Dworkin.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.560
Is that really what we've sunk to around here?

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.800
You know, I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.240
I know this isn't very original, but I had a bad year.

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.520
You know, I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot,

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.320
got my heart comprehensively broken,

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:24.160
and then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:27.280
spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.280
You know, I stopped saying yes to life,

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:32.320
and I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.120
By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon,

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.600
one of the greatest appropriate-for-all-ages video games of all time.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.760
Look at him go!

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.880
I'm taking the hair clips out.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:45.840
I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.520
It's because I'm trans.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.040
It's because I'm gay.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.560
That's why I'll die alone.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.160
Yeah, that's the reason I'm alone.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.320
Definitely not because I don't leave the house.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.800
See, I am not immune to incel-tier brain poisoning,

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.320
and you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.640
Society did this to me.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.400
A transphobic society made me hate myself.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.520
Well, yeah, that's true.

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.160
But at a certain point, you have to take responsibility for your own mind,

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.680
and decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.680
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.280
the mind is its own place,

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.080
and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.040
Yes, squad.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.640
So I ask myself, what kind of mind do I want to be?

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.120
Do I want to obsess over what I lack,

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.000
concede society's judgment of my inferiority,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.400
become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.240
Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor,

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.760
stop chasing the dragon, and say yes to life?

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.480
The answer, of course, is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.

01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.920
But we're not gonna do that,

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.960
because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.840
The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:08.880
Also, nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.200
It's beyond a personality flaw,

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.560
it's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance at happiness you have.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.960
So in the short time that you're alive,

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.920
you have to discover that which is noble in yourself, and say yes to it.

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.920
You know, don't say no to getting older, say yes to being a MILF.

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.600
Yes, yes.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.120
What I'm really trying to say here is,

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.400
Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.600
Spongebob says yes to life, and so should we.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.120
Yes to ourselves.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.160
Yes to art.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.680
Yes to sensuality.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.200
Yes to the world.

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.080
Yes.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.040
Yes.

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.400
Eh, we.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.960
Is this really how we're ending the video?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.120
I guess.

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.480
Okay, bye!

01:45:52.480 --> 01:46:08.640
🎶

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.040
Oh, so what if my fantasies make no sense?

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.040
You wanna talk about things that don't make sense?

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.240
Heterosexuality.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.320
Let's put that under the microscope, hmm?

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.040
You want me to believe that a straight woman,

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.840
who knows the difference between magenta and mauve,

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:25.680
is gonna date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.520
and that's just gonna work out fine.

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.000
You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.000
I don't think so.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.200
Not on my watch.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.440
See, I think straight men should date each other.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.640
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then f*** each other.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.880
And then straight women can pair off,

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.480
decoupage some shit,

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.920
and eat each other out.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.880
Isn't that better?

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:46.080
Isn't that more rational?

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.840
I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.640
Like, I wish I had anatomical control over them.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:51.140
Hello?

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:52.960
Yes, Dr. Spiegel?

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.480
Yes, it's me again.

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.480
I have a suggestion.

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.280
What do we even have here?

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.880
We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp,

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.160
some, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.600
I've never been as much into rolls.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.120
I'm a cat, you know I like fish.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.840
You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.640
It's an affront to my feline nature.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:52.640
So

01:47:52.640 --> 01:48:15.600
Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
