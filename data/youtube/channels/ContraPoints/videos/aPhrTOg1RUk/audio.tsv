0	19720	So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.
19720	25960	I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.
25960	26960	We have to dial in.
26960	33760	Hello operator, connect me to hell.
33760	41240	This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,
41240	45080	was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.
45080	49160	There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,
49160	54720	there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.
54720	60040	One twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption,
60040	66240	and many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.
66240	72200	So when the day arrived, and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned
72200	77400	out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere
77400	82200	that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean if you weren't
82200	87440	on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine the revelry.
87440	92560	Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models and
92560	93880	rich white kids.
93880	96960	Yuppie hunger games hosted by Ja Rule.
96960	101720	Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.
101720	105400	Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.
105400	107400	Let them eat salad.
108400	112960	It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.
112960	117000	You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders elected, but at least those
117000	119240	sandwiches were garbage.
119240	128120	Jamila Jamil is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.
128120	129760	Imagine looking like this.
129760	131360	Imagine being perfect.
131360	133000	Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?
133000	135520	Why are you doing this to women?
135520	139280	One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen Jamila,
139280	141640	Your skin is so perfect, uwu.
141640	143000	And Jamila replied,
143000	148560	My skin is currently clear because A. Privileged people have more access to good
148560	155360	quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly less stressful than those with less privilege.
155360	157640	I also get to sleep more because of this.
157640	161880	All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances
161880	162880	easily.
162880	166960	B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.
166960	169680	C. I exfoliate twice a week.
169680	170680	Oh boy.
170680	172600	Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, gorge.
172600	174040	I'll protect you, queen.
174040	176080	Could she be any more annoying?
176080	178920	Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.
178920	183200	This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.
183200	187480	Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.
187480	192000	Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.
192120	198800	But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that
198800	204640	account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality,
204640	205640	does it?
205640	210440	And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check
210440	211440	your privilege.
211440	216160	A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous
216160	222360	now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.
222360	226760	And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to it.
226760	232240	I don't have any beauty secrets, I guess I just drink lots of water.
232240	233240	Take me, mother.
233240	237960	A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height
237960	239760	of the coronavirus pandemic.
240080	243280	40 and feeling so humbled and blessed.
243280	247360	There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when
247360	250280	we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.
250280	255200	After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised
255200	259760	my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were
259760	262200	normal for just a brief moment in time.
262200	266800	I realize that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right now, so
266840	271840	in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.
271840	275560	Hashtag thisis40, tag me bitch.
275560	282000	So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege-checking maneuver, and once again,
282000	283000	it has not gone well.
283000	289080	You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century, bragging about being humble and letting us
289080	290080	eat cake.
290080	295120	Millions of Americans sick and suffering, standing for hours in food lines and being
295120	298640	evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege?
298640	304400	Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone-deaf humbled and blessed line, hashtag
304400	305400	gross.
305400	307160	Happy birthday, mmm.
307160	311760	I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read the motherfucking-
311760	316720	So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about
316720	321480	was not that she had the party, I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got
321480	322480	that milf money?
322640	329040	The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,
329040	330680	a little bit yikesy.
330680	335720	But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?
335720	338400	This isn't a good look, we say.
338400	339880	Bad optics.
339880	341880	Not relatable.
341880	342880	Relatable.
342880	346160	Relatability is not a moral category.
346160	350600	This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.
350600	352400	Like I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,
352400	356840	The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.
356840	360400	They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.
360400	363280	This should have stayed in the drafts.
363280	364280	Hashtag tone-deaf.
364280	369520	Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?
369520	374200	We didn't get to have birthday parties, some people couldn't even travel to visit
374200	376000	their dying relatives.
376000	382920	So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was painful.
382920	387000	Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.
387000	393680	And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury
393680	401760	music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jameel's privileged pores,
401760	403840	no one ever uses the word envy.
404520	409440	It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our
409440	410440	own psychology.
410440	414840	So in this video, I want to take a long hard look at envy.
414840	419920	What is it, where does it come from, and seriously, what is Jameela Jameel's skincare routine?
419920	421440	Drop it in the comments, bestie.
421440	423560	Okay, so what is envy?
423560	428800	Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.
428840	435200	Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have
435200	437800	what we want, but cannot get.
437800	442560	It's not simply wanting what another person has, that's greed, which is a much more
442560	444040	wholesome sin.
444040	449320	Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,
449320	452000	it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.
452000	458400	And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy, it's emulation or admiration.
458400	460760	At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.
460760	461760	It covets.
461760	467800	Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging them what
467800	468800	they have.
468800	474200	You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be humiliated
474200	479640	and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.
479640	485360	Like Satan, who was willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John Milfton.
485360	488120	It's gonna be 90 minutes of Milf jokes, kids, so strap in.
488240	492040	So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.
492040	498360	For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary
498360	502560	celibates, these men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.
502560	508440	It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,
508440	509880	masculine men.
509880	516040	For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only
516040	521560	want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.
521560	525200	Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.
525200	530520	So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's emulation,
530520	536080	the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more popular option,
536080	538080	you can take the black pill.
538080	542720	Which means believing that chadhood is genetically determined at birth, there is no hope, no
542720	548160	woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.
548160	554320	This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire wikipedia
554320	556800	timeline dedicated to tracking them.
556800	560960	And the essential motivation for this violence is envy.
560960	567600	The incel's failed ambition and sense of incurable predestined inferiority turns venomous.
567600	573200	The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,
573200	575360	then no one can.
575360	577200	In the words of a murderer,
577200	582880	The day of retribution is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have.
582880	585440	But most incels aren't murderers.
585440	590000	Most of the time, envy is most harmful to the person who envies.
590000	594160	The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.
594240	598720	There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.
598720	601040	Because the other sins are fun, right?
601040	603360	Greed, gluttony, lust?
603360	605200	That's what I call a good time.
605200	607520	But envy is misery.
607520	610720	Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.
610720	616480	Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would
616480	619040	be like without rich parents.
619040	619540	Yes.
620160	622240	Rich refugee crisis.
622240	625680	We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.
625680	626640	Look around you.
626640	628400	We've got the guillotine memes.
628400	631280	We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.
631280	632800	And none of this is new.
632800	637920	The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,
637920	640720	Jaja Gabor, who supposedly said,
640720	646800	When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.
646800	648800	And fair enough, it's a good source of protein.
648800	650240	But take it from me kids,
650240	653440	cannibalism is one of those tricky things.
653440	655120	It's hard to do just once.
655120	656560	You develop a taste for it.
656560	658480	It's like they say at NA meetings,
658480	660960	once you've lured, you just want more.
660960	663040	Also, who counts as the rich?
663040	664240	Am I the rich?
664240	666480	I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat.
666480	666980	EAT.
668800	669300	Stop it.
670080	671760	See, this is why I quit academia.
671760	674560	If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.
674560	676320	And I don't want to behave myself.
676320	677600	I want to be bad.
677600	678800	Do you want to be bad with me?
679600	681120	Let's be bad.
681440	709600	So, you might think that envy is simply the product of inequality,
709600	712960	and that societies that have more inequality have more envy.
712960	714160	I used to assume that too.
714160	716720	But the more I think about it, the more I realize,
716720	718080	that might not be true.
718080	720160	Envy is a basic part of human nature.
720160	723520	It exists in all societies and all economic systems,
723520	728080	and it begins any time two or more people start comparing themselves.
728080	729040	Part Two.
729040	730800	The Desire for Mommy's Milk.
732800	736640	According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy,
736640	737280	Daddy!
737280	740800	The first stage of human development is the oral stage,
740800	744240	in which the primary concern is oral gratification,
744240	746800	which is of course provided by mommy milkies.
747440	748560	Am I doing too much?
748560	750000	I'll tone it down just a little bit.
750000	753840	So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud,
753840	756960	and it's true, he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend
756960	758880	who had some zany ideas.
758880	760080	Like penis envy.
760080	762800	Maybe there's transgender men who experience that,
762800	766000	but I don't think it's a basic fact of the female condition.
766000	769120	As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?
769120	770480	Because I take that personally.
770480	772880	I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor.
772880	774800	But I feel like even when Freud is wrong,
775360	777600	he's often at least onto something.
777600	779520	Like with the Oedipus Complex,
779520	782480	it's not that you literally desire your mother, right?
783040	784160	That would be weird.
784160	786720	It's more that you desire an archetype.
786720	787840	Mother, right?
788480	789200	Mommy.
789200	790080	You guys get it.
790080	791840	Gen Z TikTok lesbians get it.
791840	794160	They're the ones who got me started on this milk shit.
794160	795600	I'm a reverse Socrates.
795600	797120	I've been corrupted by the young.
797120	800320	My innocent and delicate nature has been defiled.
800320	803120	So Freud says that in the first two years of life,
803120	806320	libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk.
806320	810080	And it's also in this stage that envy first emerges.
810080	812320	So I was the oldest child in my family,
812320	814960	and I was less than two years old when my brother was born.
814960	817520	So I don't remember this because I was one year old,
817520	820480	but my family tells me that when my brother was born,
820480	823040	I was just insanely jealous.
823040	824480	Oh, and I guess now's a good time
824480	827280	to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy.
827280	830080	Scholars agree that there is a difference,
830080	833440	and usually they describe the difference
833440	834720	in one of two ways.
834720	837520	The first is that jealousy is defensive.
837520	840720	It's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours.
840720	843040	Whereas envy is offensive.
843040	846400	It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.
846400	848240	And the second difference is that envy
848240	851200	is between two people, the envier and the envied,
851200	853680	whereas jealousy typically involves three people.
853680	856400	As in romantic jealousy, where you have the subject,
856400	858800	the romantic object, and then the rival.
858800	860800	And the subject is jealous of the rival
860800	863200	because they're protective of their relationship
863200	864720	with the romantic object.
864720	867120	And that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry,
867120	870160	just substituting the romantic object for mommy.
870160	871520	Of course in ordinary English,
871520	873200	people are always gonna say jealousy
873200	874880	when they really mean envy,
874880	878320	probably because jealousy has less negative connotations.
878320	880320	And I think it's pointless to try to fight that,
880320	882720	like I wouldn't go around correcting people,
882720	884800	but just keep in mind that there is a difference.
884800	888560	So sibling rivalry, is that envy or jealousy?
888560	889840	Well I think it's both,
889840	891840	because initially you're defensive
891840	894080	of your privileged only child relationship
894080	895120	with your parents.
895120	897840	But a new baby often gets more attention,
897840	900160	at least in your paranoid toddler brain,
900160	902240	and you might be envious of that.
902240	905440	And in romantic jealousy, you may also envy the rival
905440	907840	if she has qualities that you wish you had.
907840	910000	You know, young kids are little egotists
910000	912880	who are very sensitive to when another child
912880	915040	might be getting preferential treatment.
915040	917840	One of the favorite phrases of tiny babies
917840	920000	is it's not fair.
920000	921520	It's not fair.
923680	925040	Tell me about it, Pampino.
925040	926080	And I've got bad news.
926800	929360	Life is not getting any more fair than this.
929360	930800	According to the Bible,
930800	933040	one of the first events in human history
933040	937040	is the story of Cain y Abel, los dos hermanos.
937040	939040	I don't know why I said it in Spanish.
939040	940560	I guess I just thought it would sound cool.
941440	942400	Was I wrong?
942400	943200	Cain.
943200	945200	It just sounds so much better than Cain.
945200	946720	Cain and Abel.
946720	948560	Cain and Abel.
948560	951520	God tells Cain and Abel each to make a sacrifice,
951520	953680	and then God prefers Abel's.
953680	956800	You know, because God loves meat.
956800	959840	Then, in an act of malicious envy toward Abel,
959840	961760	in spite towards God the Father,
961760	964080	Cain kills his younger brother.
964080	966480	In my earliest memories of my brother,
966480	967840	I already loved him,
967840	969680	and I don't remember the envy.
969680	971680	So I guess I wasn't a Cain.
971680	972320	Cain.
972320	974800	So I must have somehow worked through this
974800	976240	without resorting to murder.
977200	980800	Freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger
980800	983600	leads to a recognition of impotence.
983600	984640	Because at first,
984640	988320	you selfishly want to be the special most-loved child.
988320	990480	But you see that your parents love your sibling
990480	991520	just as much as you,
992080	994240	and you're powerless to do anything about it.
994240	997440	So your ambition to superiority fails.
997440	999120	And so you have no choice
999120	1001920	but to repress your ambition to superiority
1001920	1003200	as well as your envy.
1003200	1005120	And the result of that repression
1005120	1008000	is what we could call herd instinct.
1008000	1009040	Solidarity.
1009040	1011760	This feeling of identifying with a group,
1011760	1013120	the equal siblings.
1013120	1014160	And as you get older,
1014160	1017120	the herd instinct evolves into feelings about
1017120	1020160	justice, duty, community, and equality.
1020160	1022000	But Freud thought these feelings
1022000	1025680	retain a vestige of repressed envy.
1025680	1027440	If I can't be the favorite,
1027440	1029600	if I can't have special privileges,
1030400	1032240	then no one can.
1032240	1033840	And from these observations,
1033840	1035760	Freud made the generalization,
1035760	1040000	Social justice means that we deny ourselves
1040000	1042560	many things so that others
1042560	1045280	may have to do without them as well.
1045280	1047040	Okay, so we don't want other people
1047040	1049520	to have anything we can't have.
1049520	1052720	So we enviously insist on equality
1052720	1054080	as a defense against
1054080	1056240	the greater prosperity of others.
1056240	1058720	Now, I don't think I completely agree with that.
1058720	1060080	Like I think Freud is definitely
1060080	1061520	onto something here.
1061520	1063600	But don't some of our community feelings
1063600	1065520	also come from a place of
1065520	1067360	genuine care for other people?
1069360	1071200	I cared for someone once.
1072960	1073920	Rosalind.
1075840	1077760	Well, we'll come back to that later.
1077760	1079280	Let's put a pin in me for now.
1079280	1081760	A pin in it for now.
1081760	1082800	In Freud, I mean.
1083600	1085200	Let's put a pin in Freud.
1086720	1089680	In a 1966 book titled Envy,
1089680	1091440	A Theory of Social Behavior,
1091440	1094000	the sociologist Helmut Schuck argued
1094000	1094880	that rather than being,
1094880	1096400	that is a very German name.
1096400	1097360	Helmut Schuck?
1097360	1099440	It's putting me in a German mood, sweetie.
1099440	1101280	Hallo meine Lieben.
1101280	1103760	Heute gibt's ein neues Video.
1103760	1105600	I just get worse at German every year.
1105600	1107280	Schuck argued that rather than being
1107280	1109840	the result of social or economic inequality,
1109840	1113120	envy is a universal across all human societies,
1113120	1115440	including very egalitarian ones.
1115440	1118160	For example, in tribal and village cultures
1118160	1119120	around the world,
1119120	1121520	there's often a concept of black magic
1121520	1122720	or witchcraft,
1122720	1125280	which are thought to be used by envious people
1125280	1127360	to bewitch the ones they envy.
1127360	1128960	You're probably familiar with the concept
1128960	1130080	of the evil eye,
1130080	1131760	which originates in ancient Greece
1131760	1133600	or maybe even earlier than that.
1133600	1135760	Cultures all over the world today
1135760	1138960	understand the evil eye as a kind of curse
1138960	1142240	cast by the malignant gaze of an envious person.
1142240	1144640	Now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious,
1144640	1147280	but I actually think the concept of the evil eye
1147280	1150480	reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy
1150480	1152880	and of the social danger that it poses.
1152880	1155360	You've probably seen these amulets around,
1155360	1156880	there's an emoji for them now,
1156880	1159520	which are supposed to protect against the evil eye.
1159520	1161040	It's called a nazar,
1161040	1164160	which comes from the Arabic word for sight or surveillance,
1164160	1166320	similar to the origin of the English word envy,
1166320	1167920	which is the Latin invidia,
1167920	1169840	which just means to look at.
1169840	1171920	So there's an agreement across cultures
1171920	1173760	that envy is related to sight,
1173760	1175280	the malevolent gaze,
1175280	1176240	the evil eye.
1176240	1178400	And these amulets show that a lot of people
1178400	1180320	are afraid of being envied
1180320	1182080	and want to protect themselves.
1182080	1184320	I was just watching this Turkish YouTube channel
1184320	1186000	with an episode on the evil eye
1186000	1188560	and the host explains that for Muslims,
1188560	1190000	it's customary to say,
1191680	1194800	or God has willed it when admiring a person or object,
1194800	1197200	you know, to avoid unintentionally cursing them.
1197200	1197920	I love that.
1197920	1198880	It's like no envy,
1198880	1200640	like no homo, but no envy.
1200640	1202240	Mashallah.
1202240	1203840	The top comment on that video says,
1219040	1220480	See, this is where Kim Kardashian
1220480	1222240	went wrong with her birthday post.
1222240	1225520	Clearly, no one in the Kardashian cinematic universe
1225520	1227120	has ever heard of the evil eye.
1227120	1228880	Wait, I thought these people were Armenians.
1228880	1230240	Why haven't they heard of the evil eye?
1230240	1232960	Oh, okay, nevermind.
1232960	1235200	Every piece of media they've ever produced
1235200	1237840	is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle.
1237840	1240400	This is a particularly American thing.
1240400	1244720	Most Americans have no concept of the fear of envy.
1244720	1247520	Like there's advertisements here that literally promise,
1247520	1251120	if you buy this exclusive luxury vibrator,
1251120	1253360	you'll be the envy of all your friends.
1253360	1255440	As if it's a good thing to be envied.
1255680	1257120	Oh, but it is not.
1257120	1259760	If people envy you, they gossip about you, right?
1259760	1261840	They seethe over your successes
1261840	1263760	and celebrate your misfortunes.
1263760	1267440	Being envied is basically the opposite of being loved.
1267440	1269760	So why would anyone want to be envied?
1269760	1271600	Well, it's a contradiction of human nature.
1271600	1274000	On the one hand, we need to be loved,
1274000	1276080	but then there's this other drive in us,
1276080	1281280	this like Homeric striving for fame and glory and riches,
1281280	1284320	which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved.
1284320	1286640	In a past Gilded Age, there were stories
1286640	1289440	like Citizen Kane and Sunset Boulevard,
1289440	1292320	which warned what a sad and lonely thing
1292320	1294080	success can become.
1295120	1297680	In ancient democratic Athens,
1297680	1300560	there was a practice called ostrachismus,
1300560	1303600	which is the origin of the English word ostracism.
1303600	1305200	Ostracism was a procedure
1305200	1307200	where the Athenians would assemble
1307200	1308960	and each person would write the name
1308960	1311280	of a person they wanted to ostracize
1311280	1313840	on a pottery shard called an ostracon.
1313840	1315360	And whoever got the most votes
1315360	1318480	would simply be banished from the city for 10 years,
1318480	1319840	no questions asked.
1320880	1322160	I love the ancient world.
1322160	1324240	Things were so direct.
1324240	1326240	Often this was used to remove someone
1326240	1329600	who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant
1329600	1330720	or just annoying.
1330720	1332160	According to Plutarch,
1332160	1333920	I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia,
1333920	1335840	in one anecdote about Aristides,
1335840	1338160	known as Aristides the Just,
1338160	1340480	who was ostracized in 482,
1340480	1343040	an illiterate citizen not recognizing him
1343120	1345520	came up to ask him to write the name Aristides
1345520	1346640	on his ostracon.
1346640	1348240	When Aristides asked why,
1348240	1349440	the man replied,
1349440	1351040	it was because he was sick of hearing him
1351040	1352560	being called the Just.
1353760	1354480	It's good!
1355120	1356320	It's so good!
1356320	1358880	See this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.
1358880	1361600	This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.
1361600	1363200	People in most cultures,
1363200	1363920	not all,
1363920	1365920	but most cultures understand
1365920	1368720	that being envied is a massive social liability,
1368720	1371760	so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.
1371760	1373440	According to a Tamil saying,
1373440	1376160	the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.
1376160	1378720	This is sometimes called tall poppy syndrome
1378720	1381920	because the tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.
1381920	1384560	Shook argues that the fear of envy
1384560	1387600	is a major inhibiting force in many societies.
1387600	1388560	In Haiti,
1388560	1390240	G.E. Simpson found that a peasant
1390240	1392720	will seek to disguise his true economic position
1392720	1394640	by purchasing several smaller fields
1394640	1396720	rather than one larger piece of land.
1396720	1397600	For the same reason,
1397600	1399200	he will not wear good clothes.
1399200	1400480	He does this intentionally
1400480	1403040	to protect himself against the envious black magic
1403040	1404000	of his neighbors.
1404000	1406480	Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America.
1406480	1409360	Like I've known people from seriously wealthy families
1409360	1410560	who move to the city
1410560	1412560	and they dress like gutter punks,
1412560	1414880	like they're trying to pass as poor.
1414880	1416000	But in general,
1416000	1419440	Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy
1419440	1421120	in the way many other cultures do,
1421120	1422720	and I don't think that's an accident.
1422720	1424320	We're a nation of show-offs,
1424320	1426640	and so the taboo against discussing envy
1426640	1428560	is related to our whole national ethos
1428640	1430560	of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.
1430560	1431680	But though the fear of envy
1431680	1434080	isn't widely talked about or admitted here,
1434080	1435520	it's definitely still there,
1435520	1436640	only repressed,
1436640	1439440	confined to the realm of dreams and art.
1442960	1444480	In the movie Black Swan,
1444480	1447040	Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina
1447040	1448080	who achieves her dream
1448080	1450240	of getting the lead role in Swan Lake,
1450240	1451680	after which her life and mind
1451680	1454880	are totally unraveled by fear of envy.
1454880	1455920	Black magic,
1455920	1456960	Black Swan.
1456960	1459200	At first we see how Nina's success
1459200	1462160	comes at the very real cost of being envied,
1462160	1464080	by her ex-ballerina mother,
1464080	1466240	by the other girls in the company,
1466240	1469120	and by the former lead ballerina she's replaced.
1469120	1470400	Did you suck his c***?
1471440	1472640	Not all of us have to.
1474000	1475440	I love Winona Ryder so much.
1475440	1477200	I love Natalie Portman so much.
1477200	1479200	I love Mila Kunis so much.
1479200	1480160	I just like women.
1480160	1481840	Where's my shock wand?
1481840	1482560	Stop it.
1482560	1483440	Stop standing.
1483440	1486480	But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia,
1486480	1488240	as Nina begins hallucinating
1488240	1490000	Black Swan doppelgangers,
1490000	1493200	and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis,
1493200	1494880	who's trying to steal her role.
1494880	1496800	You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.
1497360	1498400	They'll getcha.
1498400	1499920	Did you have some sort of
1499920	1501600	lesbian dream about me?
1501600	1502160	Stop.
1502160	1504160	You could argue that Nina is actually suffering
1504160	1505920	a kind of self-envy,
1505920	1508080	where she envies the disinhibited,
1508080	1509440	sexually liberated,
1509440	1511120	corrupted part of herself
1511120	1513440	that's capable of adult eroticism,
1513440	1515360	and also of dancing the Black Swan.
1515920	1517920	So she imagines that part of herself
1517920	1521200	as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.
1521200	1524560	It's like her mind is split between two impulses.
1524560	1526800	There's her dominant White Swan impulse,
1526800	1529760	which we could call the Squidward personality,
1529760	1531680	perfectionistic and orderly,
1531680	1532960	but reserved,
1532960	1533920	priggish,
1533920	1534880	stiff.
1534880	1538400	And then there's her repressed Black Swan impulse,
1538400	1541680	which we could call the SpongeBob personality,
1541680	1542640	intuitive,
1542640	1543600	chaotic,
1543600	1544320	ecstatic.
1544960	1546640	In SpongeBob SquarePants,
1546640	1550880	the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy,
1550880	1552320	stemming from failed ambition.
1552320	1556400	Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.
1556400	1558560	Squidward aspires to artistic achievement
1558560	1560160	but remains a mediocrity,
1560160	1563040	partly because of his overly dry,
1563040	1565520	doctrinaire attitude towards art.
1565520	1568000	SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal.
1568000	1569280	They're literally neighbors,
1569280	1571920	and they both work the same fast food service job
1571920	1574320	for the same exploitative capitalist.
1574320	1577760	But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius
1577760	1580800	who's able to transform the most mundane activities,
1580800	1582080	blowing bubbles,
1582080	1583200	flipping burgers,
1583200	1585360	into a kind of aesthetic rapture.
1585360	1589280	Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy
1589280	1591120	and intuitive creativity,
1591120	1593680	but he can't admit that envy to himself.
1594240	1597360	So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling
1597360	1598560	is contempt,
1598640	1602400	snobbish disdain for SpongeBob's childish behavior.
1602400	1605120	What the people want is culture,
1605120	1607040	not dancing bubbles.
1607040	1607920	Though deep down,
1607920	1610960	Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.
1610960	1612400	It's beautiful.
1613200	1614560	Uh, I mean, uh.
1614560	1616080	Which we see when he can't help himself
1616080	1617440	from blowing bubbles,
1617440	1619440	or when he trades away all of his possessions
1619440	1622160	for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands
1622160	1624320	was a source of infinite entertainment.
1624320	1627280	A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid
1627280	1628480	re-watch it now,
1628480	1630000	and are horrified to discover
1630000	1631840	that they identify with Squidward,
1631840	1633040	whereas as children,
1633040	1634720	they identified with SpongeBob.
1634720	1636400	Well, you either die as SpongeBob,
1636400	1638160	or you live long enough to see yourself
1638160	1639120	become the Squidward.
1639120	1641920	FUTURE!
1641920	1644080	And there's a pain in becoming Squidward,
1644080	1645920	which is usually explained as
1645920	1648400	the disappointing drudgery of adult life,
1648400	1650240	or simply loss of childhood.
1650240	1652720	I would argue that envy of childhood
1652720	1655680	is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.
1655680	1656560	Squidwardian?
1656560	1657840	Are we saying that word?
1657840	1659440	Are we really saying that word out loud?
1660000	1661360	To an audience of millions?
1662720	1663600	Okay!
1663600	1665520	It's basically the same dynamic
1665520	1669040	as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.
1669040	1671680	Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!
1671680	1673440	You gotta watch out for that one, kids.
1673440	1675280	If a mysterious stranger shows up
1675280	1676720	on your doorstep at midnight
1676720	1679840	asking you to compose a requiem mass for your own father,
1679840	1681200	just say no.
1681200	1683840	So in Spongemadeus' Mozart pants,
1683840	1686320	we have a diligent though stuffy wannabe,
1686320	1688160	envying the effortless playfulness
1688160	1689760	of the spontaneous genius.
1689760	1705520	Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is,
1705520	1708080	well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.
1708080	1710480	Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants
1710480	1712320	through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,
1712320	1714240	stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,
1714240	1716320	we could say that Squidward represents
1716320	1718640	what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,
1718640	1721440	while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.
1721440	1722960	Nietzsche thought there were two
1722960	1726480	conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.
1726480	1729120	The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo,
1729120	1733680	is the drive towards self-control, order, logic, morality.
1733680	1736240	And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus,
1736240	1740960	is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion, intuition.
1740960	1744640	Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives
1744640	1749360	in conflict, with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.
1749360	1751440	Of course, this is a misrepresentation
1751440	1753520	of how art is actually created,
1753520	1755280	because Nietzsche's whole point is that
1755280	1757520	you need a balance of the two drives.
1757520	1760880	In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist
1760880	1763760	like SpongeBob, because creating good art
1763760	1767040	requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.
1767040	1769200	See? It is all in the technique.
1769200	1771840	Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.
1771840	1773120	Get off the stage!
1773120	1776880	So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.
1776880	1779200	In order to give the perfect performance,
1779200	1782320	Mina has to unify her fragmented personality
1782320	1785680	and dance both swans, resolving the envious rivalry
1785680	1787680	between her two artistic impulses.
1788640	1789600	It was perfect.
1790560	1799520	Another movie about fear of envious ballerina-doppelgangers
1800720	1801760	Can you guess it?
1801760	1805120	is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,
1805120	1808880	which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear
1808880	1810880	of the American middle class.
1810880	1814320	We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family
1814320	1816560	with a vacation house and a boat,
1816560	1820960	along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family
1820960	1822720	whom the Wilsons envy.
1822720	1824400	Saw their new car, right?
1824400	1825120	You had to do it.
1825120	1827920	You just had to get that thing to fuck with me too.
1827920	1830400	One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded
1830400	1833760	by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.
1833760	1836560	Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,
1836560	1839600	explains that her family is metaphysically tethered
1839600	1842960	to the Wilsons, living wretched and destitute versions
1842960	1846160	of their lives in a liminal backroom's underworld.
1846160	1847520	It's super fucking liminal.
1847520	1849760	I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.
1849760	1850320	Not again.
1850960	1853840	Once upon a time, there was a girl,
1853840	1855360	and the girl had a shadow.
1856000	1859120	The two were connected, tethered together.
1859680	1864080	When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.
1864720	1866400	But when the shadow was hungry,
1866960	1870560	she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.
1871280	1873680	We later find out that all over the US,
1873680	1876000	O-U-S spells us.
1876000	1877840	Hey, that's the title of the movie.
1877840	1878880	Ohhhhh.
1878880	1881200	The tethered have risen up to kill
1881200	1883280	their privileged doppelgangers,
1883280	1885520	and to link arms across the country
1885520	1887440	in a dark parody of the real world
1887440	1891600	1986 homelessness fundraiser Hands Across America.
1891600	1894800	So my reading of Us is that it's an expression
1894800	1897680	of middle class guilt about privilege,
1897680	1898960	and fear of envy.
1898960	1901440	It's not a movie about the working class.
1901440	1903520	If it was a movie about the working class,
1903520	1904880	then the working class would be able
1904880	1906320	to speak human languages,
1906320	1907920	and would not be scary monsters
1907920	1909120	who make animal sounds
1910240	1912480	and stagger around like zombies.
1912480	1915600	This is a movie about the anxious middle class's
1915600	1918000	nightmare of the working class.
1918000	1920400	Us represents in a self-aware way
1920400	1923920	what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.
1923920	1926080	The fear of the envious poor,
1926080	1928880	of revolution, of slave revolt.
1928880	1931040	Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.
1931040	1933840	But Us diverges from other home invasion movies
1933840	1936800	by not just being fearful about the underclass,
1936800	1938560	but also guilty.
1938560	1941360	The idea of the tethered underclass
1941360	1943840	represents life as a zero-sum game
1943840	1946160	where every moment of your happiness
1946160	1949280	is bought with someone else's suffering.
1949280	1951680	It's an incredibly guilty fantasy,
1951680	1955280	an internalization of the black magic logic
1955280	1958000	of people who blame their own misfortunes
1958000	1959440	on the people they envy.
1959440	1960800	As Shook puts it,
1960800	1962000	my neighbor's harvest
1962000	1963920	can only have turned out better than mine
1963920	1965600	because he has somehow succeeded
1965600	1967760	in reducing mine by black magic.
1967760	1971040	So the fear of envy and the guilt of success
1971040	1973280	are repressed in American culture,
1973280	1975600	but they still find expression in movies.
1975600	1976960	Jordan Peele is kind of like
1976960	1979440	the Charles Dickens of the 21st century.
1979440	1982160	Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol,
1982160	1983840	a story about the guilt of the rich
1983840	1985040	if ever there was one.
1985040	1987040	You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts
1987040	1989040	who show him how wretched and sad
1989120	1991040	the lives of his employees are,
1991040	1994160	and how he'll die alone and hated by everyone,
1994160	1996720	and his funeral is only attended by businessmen
1996720	1999280	on the condition that lunch is provided.
1999280	2000960	Dickens was truly the master
2000960	2002800	of scaring the rich straight.
2002800	2004560	So maybe fear of envy
2004560	2007280	can serve a softly regulatory function
2007280	2010640	by motivating charity and generosity in the rich.
2010640	2011760	But in general,
2011760	2015200	I'm suspicious of envy as a motivation for politics.
2015200	2016400	Because remember,
2016400	2018480	the basic logic of envy is,
2019040	2021920	if I can't have it, then no one can.
2021920	2026160	Which is a purely negative, destructive style of thinking.
2026160	2028320	It's taking privileges away,
2028320	2031120	not for the material benefit of the underprivileged,
2031120	2034400	but merely for the psychological satisfaction
2034400	2035840	of the envious person.
2035840	2037840	And that's even worse when you consider
2037840	2039760	that envy is subjective.
2039760	2041600	It doesn't necessarily target
2041600	2043680	objective power and privilege.
2043680	2046800	So envy in politics is not by any means
2046800	2048320	relegated to the left.
2048320	2050880	Conservative politics is brimming with envy.
2050880	2053840	Like in this debate about forgiving student loan debt,
2053840	2055360	you often hear people say,
2055360	2057440	I had to pay my student loans,
2057440	2058960	so they should too.
2058960	2061920	Debt forgiveness is not fear.
2061920	2062960	The logic here is,
2062960	2065200	since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,
2065920	2067120	no one should.
2067120	2069520	It's intergenerational envy,
2069520	2071120	which is a pretty common thing.
2071120	2074320	Usually older generations envying the young.
2074320	2076400	Kids these days have it so easy.
2076400	2079280	When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast
2079280	2082560	and sent text messages on the Pony Express.
2082560	2084000	The feeling is basically,
2084000	2086480	it's not fair that kids these days
2086480	2088960	don't have to suffer like I suffered.
2088960	2092160	Or think about the concept of a welfare queen,
2092160	2095440	which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.
2095440	2098080	Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.
2098080	2100400	It's all this envious suspicion
2100400	2103040	about illegal immigrants sneaking in
2103040	2104560	and getting government handouts
2104560	2106240	without having to pay taxes.
2106240	2107920	I had to work hard for my money,
2107920	2110320	so why should these people get a free ride?
2110320	2112080	Not that that's what being an illegal immigrant
2112080	2113280	is actually like,
2113280	2117280	except in the imagination of people who envy them.
2117280	2120800	Envy is felt more intensely by prideful people,
2120800	2124320	so it's especially sharp when it targets people
2124320	2127600	who are supposed to be beneath you.
2127600	2130320	The Jewish radical feminist Andrea Dworkin
2130320	2133120	made what I think is a pretty compelling argument
2133120	2136400	that both anti-Semitism and misogyny
2136400	2138240	are partly rooted in envy.
2138240	2140080	She quotes a bigoted argument
2140080	2142400	made by the wife-killing protagonist
2142400	2145280	of Tolstoy's story, The Kreutzer Sonata,
2145280	2147520	who resents that women and Jews
2147520	2151520	find a kind of paradoxical power in their own oppression.
2151520	2152880	Just like the Jews,
2152880	2154720	as they pay us back for their oppression
2154720	2156320	by financial domination,
2156320	2157600	so it is with women.
2157600	2160080	Ah, you want us to be traitors only?
2160240	2160880	All right.
2160880	2163840	As traitors, we will dominate you, say the Jews.
2163840	2166800	Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?
2166800	2167520	All right.
2167520	2170160	As objects of sensuality, we will enslave you.
2170160	2171360	Dworkin explains,
2171360	2173840	This dominance of men by women
2173840	2176240	is experienced by the men as real,
2176240	2177520	emotionally real,
2177520	2178800	sexually real,
2178800	2180240	psychologically real.
2180240	2183760	It emerges as the reason for the wrath of the misogynist.
2183760	2186400	The woman appears to control sex.
2186400	2187760	The man needs it.
2187760	2191920	This causes his rage at her perceived power over him.
2191920	2194880	Women control access to what men want,
2194880	2197680	which gives women a kind of indirect power
2197680	2199120	that some men envy.
2199120	2202000	They envy the sexual power of women.
2202000	2204320	It doesn't matter to the misogynist that,
2204320	2206400	especially at the time Tolstoy was writing,
2206400	2210320	women objectively have less power in society than men.
2210320	2214640	He envies women because they have what he desires.
2214720	2218160	Likewise, it didn't matter to Weimar anti-Semites
2218160	2221200	that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.
2221200	2225520	Anti-Semitism is often rooted in an envious obsession
2225520	2228080	with the disproportionate influence
2228080	2230320	and affluence of Jewish people.
2230320	2232640	It is not the absolute differences between men
2232640	2233600	which feed envy,
2233600	2235440	but subjective perception,
2235440	2237040	the optics of envy.
2237760	2240400	Magic mirror on the wall.
2240400	2242400	Who's the cuntest of them all?
2245200	2248960	Thou art cunt, my queen.
2248960	2253440	But hold, a lovely maid I see.
2254320	2257760	Oh, yes, it's me.
2257760	2258800	What?
2258800	2261200	In a way, I'm kind of just in the beginning
2261200	2262640	of this whole transition.
2262640	2264400	I'm not sure what to expect.
2264400	2265760	I'm kind of just in the beginning
2265760	2267200	of this whole transition.
2267200	2269200	You know, like a young little girl
2269200	2270960	going through all these things,
2270960	2272960	having a sleepover with the girls.
2272960	2274480	What do we do on a sleepover?
2274480	2276480	Do we have like pillow fights and all that stuff?
2278320	2281920	Alas, she is more cunt than thee.
2283760	2286160	My pussy stunting on the Gram has come to nothing.
2290560	2292720	The classic 1937 Disney movie
2292720	2294240	Snow White and the Wicked Milf
2294240	2295680	is the story of a, quote,
2295680	2297360	vain and wicked queen
2297360	2298800	who obsessively envies
2298800	2300640	the beauty of her own stepdaughter.
2301280	2303200	Are you sure this one's for children?
2303200	2305120	Every day the milf queen asks the mirror
2305120	2306720	who is the fairest one of all,
2306720	2307840	and the mirror responds
2307840	2309440	that the queen is the fairest,
2309440	2310800	till one day it says
2310800	2313120	the stepdaughter Snow White is the fairest,
2313120	2315440	which sends the queen into an envious fury,
2315440	2318240	resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.
2318240	2320800	So first of all, can we talk plot holes, ding?
2321440	2323360	Are we really supposed to believe
2323360	2326320	that this is more beautiful than this?
2326880	2327920	Uh, ding.
2328560	2330640	Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?
2330640	2332240	What's going on, Walt?
2332240	2333840	Why don't you take a seat?
2333840	2335840	Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.
2335840	2336560	It's hard to tell
2336560	2339120	because she's constantly surrounded by manlets,
2339120	2341120	but she's just so boring,
2341120	2344400	and the queen is such a baddie.
2344400	2346240	Step on my throat, mother.
2346800	2348080	This is a horny video.
2348080	2350080	Well, yeah, because I quit riding that brown tiger.
2350080	2352640	I can feel the pulse back in my veins.
2352640	2355520	So despite the injustice done to its lead milf,
2355520	2356720	Snow White does illustrate
2356720	2358320	some interesting things about envy.
2358320	2361040	Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft
2361040	2362560	as an expression of envy.
2362560	2364240	We have the age difference,
2364240	2367200	intergenerational envy, the envy of youth.
2367200	2369600	It kind of reminds me of those millennial women
2369600	2372160	who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need
2372160	2374000	to rage against Gen Z.
2374000	2375200	Pretty counterproductive,
2375200	2377600	since if you're worried about seeming old,
2377600	2379040	complaining about the youths,
2379600	2381600	it's probably not helping your case gorge.
2381600	2383440	You might wonder if there's also jealousy
2383440	2384960	involved with the evil queen.
2384960	2386640	Is she worried that the king
2386640	2388960	is gonna fall in love with his own daughter?
2388960	2390480	Well, I don't think so,
2390480	2392000	because we never even see the king.
2392000	2393200	The queen doesn't mention him.
2393760	2395120	It's not about the king.
2395120	2397600	So there's no romantic jealousy involved.
2397600	2400000	It's just one woman envying another woman
2400000	2401920	over beauty for its own sake.
2401920	2404080	We stan a Bechdel test passing
2405440	2406880	movie about women hating each other.
2406880	2411120	Gatekeep, gas girl, gate girl, gas keep, light boss.
2411120	2413440	In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,
2413440	2415520	the queen first tries killing Snow White
2415520	2417040	with beauty accessories,
2417040	2418160	poisoning a comb,
2418160	2420320	and lacing her to death with a corset.
2420320	2421920	I wish I could die that way.
2422640	2424400	What's really striking
2424400	2428000	is the pure kamikaze malignity of it all.
2428000	2431120	This queen, who we know is obsessed with her look,
2431120	2434000	is willing to transform herself with witchcraft
2434000	2436160	into an ugly old hag,
2436160	2438960	just to give Snow White the poisoned apple.
2438960	2441360	And the queen disguising herself as an old hag
2441360	2444320	parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.
2444320	2445440	I mean, you could actually argue
2445440	2448160	that the queen is simply a persona of Satan,
2448160	2450240	it's paradise lost all over again,
2450240	2452720	which also happens to be the title of my memoir.
2452720	2454560	The queen is incredibly petty,
2454560	2456880	because even according to the, again,
2456880	2458960	wrong and tasteless mirror,
2458960	2462240	she's still the second most beautiful woman in the world.
2462240	2466160	How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy
2466160	2468560	still be consumed by envy?
2468560	2472720	Well, basically, because that's how envy works.
2472720	2475040	It's petty, it's subjective,
2475040	2478240	and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality,
2478240	2481520	or to the absolute position on the overall hierarchy.
2481520	2484080	So you can be the second best in the world,
2484080	2486880	and still be obsessively envious
2486880	2490240	of the one person who may barely even be above you.
2490240	2491600	In fact, there's studies showing
2491600	2493280	that Olympic silver medalists
2493280	2495760	are actually less satisfied with their prize
2495760	2497280	than bronze medalists,
2497280	2498960	probably because the bronze medalist
2498960	2501120	is just happy to be on the podium at all,
2501120	2504400	while the silver medalist is so close to first,
2504400	2506720	they can't help but wonder, what if?
2506720	2509600	Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth
2509600	2512320	not by comparing ourselves to any absolute standard,
2512320	2514400	but by comparing ourselves to each other,
2514400	2516320	and we're more likely to compare ourselves
2516320	2518160	to the people who are around us
2518160	2520160	than we are to people who are far away.
2520160	2523520	We could call this the proximity effect of envy.
2523520	2526480	We're more likely to envy people who are close to us,
2526480	2527920	or similar to us,
2527920	2530400	especially people we're in competition with.
2530400	2532720	That's why social media is such a nightmare.
2532720	2534400	It's an incubator of envy,
2534400	2537120	because it puts everyone next to everyone else.
2537120	2540400	So we're all being compared, all in competition,
2540400	2542800	and it can destroy your self-esteem,
2542800	2545360	because you're comparing your actual life
2545360	2547440	to these idealized images.
2547440	2549200	And it also turns public figures
2549200	2551280	into lightning rods for envy,
2551280	2555200	because of the numeric visibility of popularity and success.
2555920	2559040	It's a perverse consequence of the proximity effect
2559040	2561920	that envy within an oppressed class
2561920	2564240	is often more venomous and obsessive
2564240	2565840	than envy for the oppressor.
2565840	2569360	So for example, in Snow White and Black Swan,
2569360	2572000	you have women envying other women,
2572000	2574800	because women are often in competition with each other.
2574800	2577120	And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.
2577120	2579280	In media, there's constant portrayals
2579280	2581280	of vain and envious women.
2581280	2584560	Jealous bitches fighting over men.
2584640	2585760	Over youth.
2585760	2586880	Over beauty.
2586880	2589040	It's like drag queen femininity.
2589040	2590800	Death becomes her femininity.
2590800	2594640	-"En garde, bitch!"
2594640	2597200	So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope,
2597920	2600640	but, how do I put this delicately,
2600640	2602640	sometimes reality is misogynistic.
2602640	2605440	Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on!
2605440	2608240	The patriarchy's machinations are clearly to blame.
2608240	2612320	In her 1976 essay Trashing the Dark Side of Sisterhood,
2612320	2615120	feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism
2615120	2617040	from within the women's movement.
2617040	2620160	-"I've been watching for years with increasing dismay
2620160	2623360	as the movement consciously destroys anyone within it
2623360	2625280	who stands out in any way."
2625280	2628560	And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist Anselma Delolio.
2628560	2630160	-"And who do they attack?
2630160	2632240	Achievement or accomplishment of any kind
2632240	2634160	would seem to be the worst crime.
2634160	2636480	Do anything that every other woman secretly
2636480	2639200	or otherwise feels she could do just as well,
2639200	2640400	and you're in for it.
2640400	2643760	You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking opportunist,
2643760	2646720	a ruthless mercenary out to make her fame and fortune
2646720	2649200	over the dead bodies of selfless sisters
2649200	2651120	who have buried their abilities
2651120	2653040	and sacrificed their ambitions
2653040	2655920	for the greater glory of feminism."
2655920	2657280	Freeman speculates,
2657280	2661840	-"The primary reason there have been so few great women blank
2661840	2665200	is not merely that greatness has been undeveloped
2665200	2666400	or unrecognized,
2666400	2669440	but that women exhibiting potential for achievement
2669440	2672160	are punished by both women and men.
2672160	2674960	The fear of success is quite rational
2674960	2677600	when one knows that the consequence of achievement
2677600	2679840	is hostility and not praise."
2679840	2681280	So at no point in this essay
2681280	2683680	does Joe Freeman use the word envy.
2683680	2686960	But as usual, envy is right below the surface,
2686960	2688320	causing all the trouble.
2689440	2691360	So Freeman is describing
2691360	2693680	how people from marginalized groups,
2693680	2696800	whose ambition raises them above the typical limits
2696800	2698480	set by marginalization,
2698480	2701360	are often ostracized from their own communities.
2701360	2704720	But she has no causal explanation for why this happens.
2704720	2705840	I have an explanation.
2705840	2707200	The explanation is envy.
2707200	2710160	And women are more likely to envy other women.
2710160	2713280	Trans women are more likely to envy other trans women.
2713280	2715760	Oh god, am I really gonna go there?
2715760	2717200	If we did this topic justice,
2717200	2719280	this video would be nine centuries long.
2719280	2722800	-"En garde, bitch!"
2722800	2726320	A lot of people assume that trans women envy cis women,
2726320	2727760	and there is some truth to that.
2727760	2729760	There definitely was a time in my life
2729760	2733200	when I used to envy cis women for being cis women,
2733200	2735120	but now I kind of just don't even allow myself
2735120	2736560	to have the thought,
2736560	2738240	what if I were a cis woman?
2738240	2742160	So in a way, because becoming a cis woman is impossible,
2742160	2743280	it's unobtainable,
2743280	2745840	I actually envy cis women less.
2745840	2749440	So trans women are more likely to envy other trans women
2749440	2751280	because of the proximity effect,
2751280	2753520	and because another trans woman
2753520	2756080	represents an actual possibility
2756080	2758960	of what I, a trans woman, could become.
2758960	2762720	She's a standard to which I could plausibly compare myself.
2762720	2765600	Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.
2765600	2767360	Am I the only one who finds it hard
2767360	2768800	to watch trans creators?
2768800	2770720	Before I realized I was a trans woman,
2770720	2772560	I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,
2772560	2774240	Nyx Fears, and other trans creators.
2774240	2776320	But ever since I realized I was trans,
2776320	2778320	I just get this angry, resentful feeling
2778320	2779280	in the pit of my stomach
2779280	2782000	whenever I get recommended any of these videos.
2782000	2783760	I seriously loved ContraPoints,
2783760	2785920	but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,
2786320	2787520	I just wanna scream.
2787520	2790480	I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.
2790480	2793120	I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.
2793120	2794480	Am I just a toxic person?
2794480	2798240	Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person,
2798240	2800400	at least not any worse than anyone else,
2800400	2803280	it's just that human nature is a toxic person.
2803280	2805200	And that angry, resentful feeling
2805200	2806640	in the pit of your stomach
2806640	2808480	that makes you wanna scream
2808480	2811360	and feel such a hatred has a name,
2811360	2813440	and the name is Envy.
2813440	2815840	I actually admire the person who wrote this post,
2815840	2816960	because they're doing the best
2816960	2818640	that any of us can do, really,
2818640	2820720	which is noticing the feeling
2820720	2822720	without endorsing the feeling.
2822720	2824960	I wish that more people could feel things
2824960	2828320	without rushing to a rational defense of the feeling.
2828320	2830160	And isn't rationality itself
2830160	2833520	often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious?
2833520	2836320	Sometimes people have no self-awareness about it at all.
2836320	2839600	For example, there's a certain kind of boomer transsexual
2839600	2840880	who complains that,
2840880	2842240	when I transitioned,
2842240	2845040	I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping
2845040	2847360	but kids these days just waltz on in
2847360	2848960	and walk out with hormones.
2848960	2851840	It's intergenerational envy, trans edition.
2851840	2853040	It was hard for me,
2853040	2855040	so it should be hard for everyone,
2855040	2856640	like the student debt debate.
2856640	2859760	If I can't have it, no one can.
2859760	2861920	And look, I do have sympathy and admiration
2861920	2863120	for older trans people.
2863120	2865680	Like, being trans in 2021
2865680	2868720	is already the maximum level of adversity
2868720	2869760	that I can handle.
2869760	2873120	I cannot imagine how hard it was to do this in the 80s.
2873120	2876800	However, the pain of envy is not a valid argument.
2876800	2878960	Envy is not sacred rage,
2878960	2881600	and the malignant demands of envious people
2881600	2883040	should be ignored.
2883040	2884240	God, this community.
2884240	2886080	The constant competition.
2886080	2888000	The envy, the cringing.
2888640	2890160	It makes it really hard to get along
2890160	2891440	with other trans people.
2891440	2892640	Oh, speaking of which.
2892640	2894400	Gay tangent, everybody.
2894400	2895680	Gay tangent.
2895680	2898240	Envy presents kind of a unique problem
2898240	2900080	to same-sex attracted people
2900080	2901920	because of the increased risk
2901920	2904960	of envying the very people you're attracted to.
2904960	2906720	I want to f*** the ones I envy.
2906720	2907920	I envy.
2907920	2909280	You know, it's the classic
2909280	2912240	do I want you or do I want to be you problem.
2912240	2914320	I've heard feminine queer women say
2914320	2916240	they could never date another femme
2916240	2917360	because they're worried
2917360	2919360	they would just end up envying her.
2919360	2922240	So dating masculine women solves that problem
2922240	2923920	because having separate roles,
2923920	2925120	separate aesthetics,
2925120	2926560	separate categories
2926560	2930240	helps to avert proximity envy between partners.
2930240	2933360	Unfortunately, I am not that smart.
2933360	2936320	Basically, I am attracted to femininity.
2936320	2937760	But I also want to embody
2937760	2939840	a kind of feminine archetype myself.
2940400	2942720	I'm not masculine and I don't want to be.
2942720	2943440	You know, I used to think
2943440	2945600	I'd only want to date another trans woman
2945600	2947440	because of the mutual understanding.
2947440	2949360	But I've kind of realized that at this point
2949360	2951520	it may actually be more psychologically healthy
2951520	2953440	for me to open up to dating cis women.
2953440	2954960	I used to not want to do that
2954960	2956960	because I was afraid it would make me feel like a man.
2956960	2960160	But at this point, honestly, just be a man.
2961120	2962160	Whatever, it's fine.
2963040	2964400	As a drag queen once said,
2964400	2966160	I'm more of a man than you'll ever be
2966160	2968320	and more of a woman than you'll ever have.
2968320	2969040	Yes, gawd.
2969600	2971680	Can we get the tequila out of the frame, please?
2971680	2973200	I think at a distance,
2973200	2977200	it's okay to indulge the attraction emulation ambiguity.
2977200	2979680	But if you want to actually have a relationship with someone,
2980240	2981920	you have to make up your mind
2981920	2983440	that you desire this woman
2983440	2985600	and you do not want to be her.
2985600	2987760	Because think about it from the other perspective.
2987760	2989680	What could be less attractive
2989680	2992240	than someone who literally wants to be you?
2992960	2996000	Teacher, make her stop copying me.
2996000	2998240	Like as much as I joke every episode
2998240	3001200	about how Buffalo Bill is an iconic trans legend,
3002080	3003840	you don't want to date that bitch.
3003840	3007040	Imagine trying to date Eve from All About Eve.
3007040	3007520	Pass.
3008080	3009040	Hard pass.
3009040	3011760	So if you're a queer woman or a queer anything, honestly,
3011760	3014160	and you find yourself envying your partner,
3014160	3017520	my advice is stop overthinking a good situation.
3017520	3020160	An enviable woman wanted to be with you.
3020160	3024160	So sit back, relax, and enjoy the clout.
3024720	3027040	I get it though, it's complicated.
3027040	3028880	You know, we're all supposed to proudly affirm
3028880	3030320	what we truly desire,
3030320	3032640	but how do you know what you truly desire?
3032640	3033840	Do I want mommy?
3034400	3036320	Or do I want to be the mommy?
3037200	3037700	Yes.
3038640	3039360	Just yes.
3040560	3043440	Anyway, let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.
3043680	3045280	The mother half took over completely.
3053440	3054640	Do I look okay?
3054640	3055760	Is my hat on straight?
3056480	3061120	So we keep running into this avoidance of the word envy.
3061120	3064000	And people especially cannot seem to notice
3064000	3066560	when they themselves are feeling envious.
3066560	3069920	Like that person who puzzled over the angry resentful feeling
3069920	3071120	in the pit of their stomach
3071120	3073600	without being able to name what they were feeling.
3073600	3075920	There's two reasons why people are usually in denial
3075920	3077120	about their own envy.
3077120	3079280	One is guilt, and the other is shame.
3080240	3080740	Shame.
3081200	3084800	Shame because admitting to yourself that you envy someone
3084800	3087520	implies that you feel inferior to them,
3087520	3088720	which is shameful.
3088720	3090400	It wounds the ego.
3090400	3093440	And guilt because envy is malicious.
3093440	3096720	If you envy someone, you may feel angry and miserable
3096720	3098880	about their success and good fortune,
3098880	3101840	and you may wish to see them ruined or brought down.
3101840	3104080	That's cruel and antisocial.
3104080	3106480	It goes against most ideas of morality,
3106480	3108160	and it's a thought that's usually
3108160	3110480	not socially acceptable to admit.
3110480	3115040	So envy is shameful, guilty, and socially unacceptable.
3115040	3118720	And we deal with that by suppressing it from our awareness.
3118720	3120240	But it is still there.
3120240	3122400	And in order to maintain the denial,
3122400	3126160	we have to convince ourselves that this angry resentful feeling
3126160	3129680	in the pit of our stomach is actually something else.
3129680	3131680	Think about how in Spongebob,
3131680	3135360	Squidward shows contempt for Spongebob's childishness,
3135360	3138240	for blowing bubbles, for having fun at work,
3138240	3142800	when in fact, Squidward envies Spongebob's uninhibited joy
3142800	3144480	and intuitive creativity.
3144480	3146960	But he can't allow himself to have the thought
3146960	3148720	that he envies Spongebob,
3148720	3150640	because that would mean recognizing
3150640	3153040	the intolerably shameful truth
3153120	3156000	that he feels inferior to Spongebob.
3156000	3158240	So what he does instead is convince himself
3158240	3161840	that what he really is, is a refined sophisticate,
3161840	3164080	scoffing at this childish fool.
3164080	3167680	How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors?
3169680	3173200	We could call this envy-to-contempt sublimation.
3173200	3176080	Sublimation is a psychoanalytic term,
3176080	3179520	which means that you transform an ego-wounding feeling
3179520	3181440	or socially unacceptable longing
3182080	3185600	into something more ego-flattering or socially acceptable.
3185600	3188000	So the classic example used by Freud
3188000	3190560	is the transformation of sexual urges,
3190560	3194240	of erotic energy, into creative expression.
3194240	3196480	It's like the founder of the NoFap movement,
3196480	3198160	Lady Gaga, once said,
3198160	3200720	I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,
3200720	3203040	they're gonna take my creativity from me through my...
3203920	3205200	So according to Freud,
3205200	3208080	the vast majority of erotic longings
3208080	3209600	can never be fulfilled.
3209600	3210960	Tell me about a segment...
3210960	3212480	Ugh, misery.
3213120	3215680	But there's a positive side to this, supposedly,
3215680	3218720	which is that you can sublimate your erotic longings
3218720	3221520	into a more socially acceptable productivity.
3221520	3223840	So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,
3223840	3227280	maybe you write novels about thirsty vampires,
3227280	3229680	or for that matter, philosophical treatises
3229680	3230880	about the will to power.
3230880	3232400	Oh, we'll get to you.
3232400	3234640	Freud thought that civilization itself
3234640	3236800	is built at the cost of our instincts,
3236800	3238960	most of which we have to sacrifice
3238960	3240640	in order to live in a society.
3240640	3242560	So like erotic impulses,
3242560	3244720	I think envy can be sublimated,
3244720	3247520	which is what's happening when it becomes contempt.
3247520	3250480	Another example is the blog McMansion Hell,
3250480	3252800	which makes fun of the tasteless architecture
3252800	3255200	of suburban ostentatious trash.
3255200	3258000	I would argue that part of the fun of this blog
3258000	3263200	is the pleasure and relief of looking down at the rich.
3263200	3265760	Because looking enviously up at the rich
3265760	3268800	is painful, it makes you feel inferior.
3268800	3270800	And a way to alleviate that pain
3270800	3273360	is to sublimate envy and pretend
3273360	3275840	that you're an aristocratic aesthete
3275840	3279440	scoffing at the vulgar taste of the era of East.
3279440	3283520	These flying buttresses are an extremely poor taste.
3283520	3286800	Another example is shit-talking plastic surgery.
3286800	3288320	I once heard a trans woman say,
3288320	3291360	at least I don't look like a botched sex doll.
3291360	3292400	The subtext is,
3292400	3294640	there's a certain kind of trans woman influencer
3294640	3297520	who lives in LA and has a lot of cosmetic surgery
3297520	3299680	to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.
3299680	3302080	But it costs a lot of money to look like this.
3302080	3304160	And a lot of trans women can't afford
3304160	3305760	surgeries that they want.
3305760	3307920	And one way to cope with frustrated desire
3308480	3310240	is to convince yourself that the thing
3310240	3313760	that's out of reach is not worth having anyway.
3313760	3315680	See also the discourse on Twitter
3315680	3317760	about how passing is transphobic.
3317760	3319200	There's an ancient Greek fable
3319200	3320800	where a fox wants some grapes,
3320800	3322400	but he can't reach the vine.
3322400	3324400	So he walks away bitterly and says,
3324400	3326720	well the grapes are transphobic anyway.
3326720	3328880	The cisgender version of this is maybe
3328880	3330720	the not-like-other-girls meme,
3330720	3333360	which is classic envy-to-contempt sublimation.
3333360	3336080	The trope is usually that other girls
3336080	3337600	are popular and slutty.
3337600	3339920	They have fake tans and fake nails.
3339920	3341680	They like partying and makeup
3341680	3344000	and stupid music for idiots.
3344000	3345760	But I'm quirky and real.
3345760	3348720	I listen to Pink Floyd and read books
3348720	3351280	and eat lots of pizza late at night,
3351280	3353120	alone and sad.
3353200	3355440	There's usually a subtext of anxiety
3355440	3356800	about inferiority,
3356800	3359600	the other girls being more socially accepted,
3359600	3361200	feminine, and put together.
3361200	3363280	A lot of times the other girls
3363280	3364800	don't even exist, right?
3364800	3367600	They're a media construct of idealized womanhood.
3367600	3369200	Like where are these other girls
3369200	3370800	who've never eaten pizza
3370800	3373760	and enjoy wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?
3373760	3375680	Are they between the sofa cushions?
3375680	3377760	Did you put them in with the other laundry?
3377760	3380000	Are the other girls in the room with us right now?
3380000	3381680	So the feeling of inferiority
3381680	3383120	toward the other girls
3383120	3385520	is reframed as a kind of contemptuous
3385520	3387040	hipster superiority,
3387040	3389120	which is really just an ego-defensive
3389120	3390640	persona of resentment.
3390640	3392320	Like Janice in Mean Girls.
3392320	3393680	She's not even really a lesbian.
3393680	3394880	She's Lebanese.
3394880	3395920	Lebanese.
3395920	3397440	Regina got confused.
3397440	3399280	And then she dances with a boy at the end
3399280	3401280	and is readmitted into girlhood.
3401280	3402720	Uh, thank you for that Tina Fey,
3402720	3403600	that's very helpful.
3404640	3405200	Great.
3405200	3406880	Another way we can reframe
3406880	3409200	feelings of envious inferiority
3409200	3412960	is by transforming them into moral superiority.
3412960	3416000	Moral superiority often being the refuge
3416000	3418640	of people with nothing better to feel superior about.
3418640	3421760	We don't have to feel guilty or ashamed of envy
3421760	3423120	if we convince ourselves
3423120	3425360	that what we're actually experiencing
3425360	3428400	is justified, legitimate hatred.
3428400	3429600	So for example,
3429600	3432320	think of the morality around sexuality.
3432320	3433920	Part 69.
3433920	3434560	Sluts.
3434560	3436240	Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?
3436240	3436880	Cancel me?
3437520	3438160	En garde!
3439760	3440320	Bitch!
3440320	3442480	Why does everyone hate sluts so much?
3442480	3444640	Sluts never did nothing wrong to nobody.
3444640	3447120	Open sexual promiscuity is in a way
3447120	3448880	analogous to opulence.
3448880	3451120	You're conspicuously enjoying something
3451120	3454480	that other people want but may not be able to get.
3454480	3457040	Many cultures have norms about modesty,
3457040	3458480	for example expecting women
3458480	3460240	to cover their hair in public.
3460240	3462000	This is usually explained as
3462000	3464240	prophylaxis against male lust,
3464240	3465840	but I wonder if it also serves
3465840	3468640	to prevent a more generalized envy,
3468640	3471520	which female beauty has a way of attracting.
3471520	3473360	Men often slut shame
3473360	3475840	because they want to control female sexuality.
3475840	3477840	And by female sexuality,
3477840	3479920	I do mean male sexuality,
3479920	3482640	because often what they're really struggling to control
3482640	3484080	is their own desire.
3484080	3486080	But slut shaming is also done
3486080	3488800	pretty viciously by women to each other.
3488800	3490560	And that's a complicated thing.
3490560	3491920	It's more than just envy.
3491920	3493280	Sometimes it comes from a sense
3493360	3496720	that a woman who's having casual sex with a lot of men
3496720	3498720	is compromising the collective
3498720	3501040	sex-withholding power of the group,
3501040	3503040	almost like she's crossing a picket line.
3503040	3505440	But there's also sometimes a resentment
3505440	3507760	that a woman who's showing skin
3507760	3511440	is using her body to get unearned attention.
3511440	3513600	And that smells like envy to me.
3513600	3515840	I don't use my body to get attention,
3516720	3518000	so no one should.
3518000	3519520	The repressed feeling is
3519520	3521040	maybe I'm a little jealous
3521040	3522720	that she's getting all this attention
3522720	3524240	by posting thirst traps,
3524240	3525920	but you don't think that.
3525920	3526880	You think,
3526880	3528880	I am above this
3528880	3531120	because I am chaste.
3531120	3532880	I have class.
3532880	3534960	I am a feminist.
3534960	3536400	I would also suggest accusing her
3536400	3538480	of pandering to the male gaze.
3538480	3540080	That's, of course, the feminist way
3540080	3543440	of calling someone a low-down hobag skank.
3543440	3546400	So again, we have envy to contempt sublimation,
3546400	3550240	and often the contempt is moral, virtuous.
3550240	3553520	The psychological need to convince ourselves
3553520	3557440	that envy is morality can become so strong
3557440	3559440	that we actually start inventing things
3559440	3561200	to be outraged about.
3561200	3563840	Take, for instance, the tendency to imagine
3563840	3565280	that the wealthy and powerful
3565280	3568240	are enjoying wild satanic orgies
3568240	3571440	and indulging all the forbidden salacious pleasures
3571440	3573520	that we ourselves are denied.
3573520	3576560	Like QAnon, these conspiracy theorists
3576560	3578720	who want us to imagine Hillary Clinton
3579280	3581600	reclining in a garden of earthly delights,
3582240	3585360	sampling the pleasures of Ephibes.
3586240	3588640	Live, laugh, love that for her.
3588640	3590960	Envy is very imaginative when it comes
3590960	3594000	to the hedonistic extravagance of the envied.
3594000	3596000	Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,
3596000	3598880	the queen of France who was guillotined by the revolution.
3598880	3601520	If you know one thing about Marie Antoinette,
3601520	3603680	it's probably that when she heard about a famine
3603680	3605440	where the people had no bread,
3605440	3606880	she infamously responded,
3607600	3608880	let them eat cake.
3610000	3611440	What an evil bitch.
3611440	3613120	How could she say that?
3613120	3616240	Well, she didn't.
3616240	3617520	She never said it.
3617520	3618560	It's a lie.
3618560	3620480	The phrase let them eat cake,
3620480	3622560	originally let them eat brioche,
3622560	3624800	first appeared in Rousseau's Confessions,
3624800	3629360	written in 1765 when Marie Antoinette was nine years old.
3629360	3633120	Rousseau attributed the line to a great princess.
3633120	3635600	Probably no one ever said this.
3635600	3637600	It's kind of like how the most famous photo
3637600	3640240	of Paris Hilton is the one where she's wearing
3640240	3642720	a Stop Being Poor t-shirt.
3642720	3644320	What an evil bitch.
3644320	3646000	How could she wear that?
3646000	3648000	Well, she didn't.
3648000	3649360	It's photoshopped.
3649360	3652560	The actual shirt said Stop Being Desperate.
3652560	3656000	Envy likes to fabricate the diabolical crimes
3656000	3657040	of its enemies.
3657040	3660000	I assume to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.
3660000	3661520	I mean, what is a Disney villain
3661520	3663440	if not an opulent homosexual
3663440	3665280	seen through the eyes of the envious?
3665360	3666640	See how I do it?
3666640	3668080	I'm gonna try lowering the ISO
3668080	3669680	because it's so f***ing bright in here now.
3670640	3672640	Okay, well it's a much lower ISO.
3672640	3674240	What if I get another white over here?
3674240	3675600	That's what this channel is really about,
3675600	3677520	one biological female's quest
3677520	3679920	to create a harmonious color story.
3679920	3681280	In the years leading up to
3681280	3683280	and during the French Revolution,
3683280	3686080	Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed
3686080	3689360	in these sleazy tabloids called libelles.
3689360	3691600	It's the same root as the English word libel.
3691600	3694640	The often pornographic libelles depicted the queen
3694640	3696320	as a bisexual demon
3696320	3698560	who was constantly having drunken orgies
3698560	3700960	and sexually manipulating everyone around her.
3700960	3703200	All of which is very interesting,
3703200	3705360	but none of which is true.
3705360	3707680	The historian Robert Darnton called it
3707680	3709760	an avalanche of defamation
3709760	3713200	that has no parallel in the history of vilification.
3713200	3715360	This woman took the blame,
3715360	3717040	the moral blame,
3717040	3720720	for the structural failings of a broken economic system.
3720720	3722000	And by the time she was brought
3722000	3725360	before the Revolutionary Tribunal in 1793,
3725360	3727600	the actual person Marie Antoinette
3727600	3729680	had long ago been overshadowed
3729680	3731760	by the libellous caricature of her.
3731760	3734240	Now there was maybe one good reason
3734240	3736080	for executing the former queen,
3736080	3739120	which is that the legitimacy of your new republic
3739120	3740800	is a little more secure
3740800	3744000	when you don't have living monarchs hanging around.
3744000	3745520	Someone better tell the English.
3745520	3747280	But the problem with that reasoning
3747280	3748960	is it has nothing to do
3748960	3752240	with whether or not the queen deserved to die.
3752240	3754960	And beheading a recently widowed mother of two
3754960	3758080	in front of a jeering crowd for political expediency
3758880	3761120	might weigh a little heavy on the conscience.
3761120	3763360	So the Revolution had to convince themselves
3763360	3765600	that the queen deserved it,
3765600	3767920	which was pretty easy after decades of,
3767920	3770800	again, false and defamatory gossip.
3770800	3773120	In her biography of Marie Antoinette,
3773120	3775200	Antonia Fraser describes
3775200	3777520	how the prison guards separated Marie
3777520	3779120	from her eight-year-old son,
3779120	3780960	who they plied with alcohol
3780960	3783760	and groomed into accusing his own mother
3783760	3785520	of incestuous abuse.
3785520	3788480	To justify killing Marie Antoinette,
3788480	3792640	they had to destroy the idea of this woman as a mother.
3792640	3795360	So she was convicted of what may as well have been
3795360	3798160	crimes against ethics in games journalism,
3798160	3799680	and sent to the guillotine,
3799680	3801200	where her last words were
3801200	3804560	sorry to the executioner for stepping on his foot.
3805520	3808800	A women-stop-apologizing challenge.
3808800	3811120	This is what a girlboss winning looks like.
3811120	3814880	So Marie Antoinette literally did nothing wrong.
3815520	3817440	Hey, how are you?
3818080	3820480	An innocent milf was killed that day,
3820480	3823200	and I, for one, won't stand for it.
3823840	3827600	So look, we have a psychological incentive
3827600	3831760	to believe that people whom we envy are immoral monsters,
3831760	3834480	because then we get to label our hatred and violence
3834480	3836160	toward them justice.
3836160	3840800	Cruelty generally cannot conceptualize itself as cruelty,
3840800	3842640	and part of the reason for that
3842640	3844720	is that calling cruelty what it is
3845360	3847040	takes the fun out of it.
3847040	3849520	It reminds me of the second best day
3849520	3851200	in the history of Twitter,
3851200	3853120	October 1st, 2020,
3853120	3855360	the day that Trump got COVID.
3855360	3856800	And I'm gonna be honest,
3856800	3860400	I have never felt more schadenfreude in my entire life.
3861280	3863120	Well, well, well.
3863120	3865920	If it isn't the leopards-eating-people's-faces party
3865920	3868000	having their faces eaten by leopards.
3868000	3877040	It's the last time I eat cake.
3877040	3878400	Like Dan Savage said,
3878400	3880720	it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.
3880720	3882080	The next day, I tweeted,
3882080	3884000	these last 24 hours have been the first time
3884000	3886320	I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years,
3886320	3888720	because this website is good for one thing only,
3888720	3891280	reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.
3891280	3893200	And someone responded to that saying,
3893200	3896560	oh my god, could you even be a bigger killjoy?
3896560	3898320	But why was I being a killjoy?
3898320	3901120	The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.
3901120	3902960	Well, for most people,
3902960	3903920	I guess not me,
3903920	3905600	but for normal people,
3905600	3906800	for other girls,
3906800	3908400	cruelty is only pleasurable
3908400	3910160	as long as they can convince themselves
3910160	3912240	it's something other than cruelty.
3912240	3913760	Justice served.
3913760	3916720	So again, reason, rationality,
3916720	3919840	are often the attempt to publicly communicate,
3919840	3922800	to evangelize our private feelings.
3922800	3925920	And morality, ethics, and justice
3925920	3927520	are often put forward
3927520	3930240	as the respectable public face
3930240	3934400	of private envy, vindictiveness, and hatred.
3934400	3937440	But is this a corruption of morality?
3937440	3940240	Or have we stumbled onto something darker?
3940240	3942400	What if morality itself
3942400	3944480	is simply the expression
3944480	3947040	of some kind of sadomasochistic urge?
3948480	3949680	It's too early for this.
3949680	3952320	I mean, it's literally 7 a.m. where I'm filming.
3952320	3954000	I don't know how this keeps happening to me.
3954000	3955920	My head gets cut off one afternoon.
3955920	3958080	Puts me in a philosophical mood.
3958080	3960320	Next morning, I've stayed up all night
3960320	3962160	and I'm still talking about the philosophes.
3964720	3965680	Meow meow.
3965680	3967040	Hello again, kittens.
3967040	3968960	Let's talk about justice, uwu.
3969520	3971440	I look like a Supreme Court justice.
3971440	3972560	Sonia?
3972560	3973840	Soda meow your?
3973840	3976320	It would actually be fierce if I wasn't, you know,
3976320	3977920	if I wasn't being Natalie.
3977920	3980720	Look, I've been seeing a lot of comments lately
3980720	3981760	along the lines of,
3981760	3985040	Natalie used to do serious academic arguments.
3985040	3986880	Now she only cares about makeup.
3987760	3989120	All right, you little shits.
3989120	3990640	You want book learning?
3990640	3992000	I'm gonna learn you so hard.
3992000	3993200	I'm gonna learn you so hard
3993200	3996880	you're gonna have a god damn headache in the morning.
3996880	3998240	Friedrich Nietzsche.
3999040	4002560	Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche.
4002560	4004000	Do you mind if I call you Fred?
4004000	4006000	Friedrich was a German philosopher
4006000	4009040	who had a lot to say about envy and morality.
4009040	4010080	But before we get into that,
4010080	4011920	I want to say a little bit about his life,
4011920	4014000	because it's just very funny.
4014000	4016720	Nietzsche is famous for his concept of the Ubermensch,
4016720	4020640	but Friedrich, sweet, beautiful little Friedrich,
4021280	4023840	he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.
4023840	4028080	Friedrich was a chronically ill, chronically in pain,
4028080	4029760	nearly blind incel,
4029760	4031760	who probably slept with a prostitute once
4031840	4034160	and got syphilis and died.
4035040	4036160	Life is funny.
4036160	4037520	Sad, but funny.
4038480	4040560	In the introduction to Beyond Good and Evil,
4040560	4041920	the editor says,
4041920	4044480	though he prided himself on being comfortable with women,
4044480	4046400	he does not seem to have been very successful
4046400	4049440	in establishing emotionally satisfying relationships with them,
4049440	4050880	which is hardly surprising.
4050880	4051840	Ah!
4051840	4053200	I love when the introduction to a book
4053200	4055360	is just a brutal roast of the author.
4055360	4056240	Who wrote this?
4056240	4057760	Rolf Peter Horstmann.
4057760	4058880	You're killing it, Rolf.
4058880	4059840	You're savage.
4059840	4060640	I adore.
4060640	4064720	Friedrich's books sold a dismal number of copies in his lifetime.
4064720	4067680	What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated,
4067680	4070400	highly neurotic man who had to try hard
4070400	4073040	to avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure.
4075600	4076080	Oh.
4076080	4078640	He was also doing huge doses of opium, relatable,
4078640	4081120	and writing himself prescriptions for sleeping pills
4081120	4083120	using the name Dr. Nietzsche.
4083760	4084800	Dr. Nietzsche?
4084800	4087200	Pretty sure I got a Xanax prescription from that guy once.
4087840	4089120	Behind a Dairy Queen.
4089120	4090800	Nietzsche was also a failed musician,
4090800	4093600	and was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's wife.
4095280	4097760	The virgin Nietzsche contra the Chad Wagner.
4097760	4098720	You beta cuck.
4100240	4101120	Why did I do that?
4101680	4103360	Can we all agree that catgirl Nietzsche
4103360	4105360	is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?
4105360	4107360	I just wanna mom this guy, honestly.
4107360	4109280	I don't even care that he's a misogynist.
4109280	4112960	His misogyny is simply too sad to be offended by.
4112960	4114320	You know, I think it's interesting
4114320	4116240	that a person this pathetic
4116240	4119040	can also be a genius whose name will never die.
4119120	4120720	He's someone who had a lot of reason
4120720	4122560	to be envious and self-pitying,
4122560	4125600	but his philosophy couldn't be more against that.
4125600	4128160	And as a person of pathetic experience myself,
4128160	4130720	that is unironically kind of inspiring to me.
4130720	4132160	So let's go in.
4132160	4135040	In his book on the genealogy of morality,
4135040	4137440	Frederick wants to explain the origin
4137440	4139520	of the concepts of good and evil.
4139520	4141520	Under what conditions did man invent
4141520	4143200	the value judgments good and evil,
4143200	4145600	and what value do they themselves have?
4145600	4148800	Have they to now obstructed or promoted human flourishing?
4148800	4150080	Hang on, my food's here.
4150080	4152240	That's right, you're getting a mukbang, sweetie.
4152240	4154080	Did you think I was gonna sit at this giant table
4154080	4155280	and not be eating something?
4155280	4156880	This video's been going on more than an hour,
4156880	4158640	so I assume you guys are drunk by now,
4158640	4160800	and we're just kind of hanging out at this point.
4160800	4162000	You guys can't even see.
4162000	4164400	Well, here, I've got a bunch of sushi,
4164400	4166000	and it's my mission to eat all of this
4166000	4167760	while summarizing the entire life
4167760	4169200	and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.
4169200	4172400	Trisha Paytas, Nicocado, consider this a challenge.
4172400	4175280	So Frederick argues that good and bad,
4175280	4177520	not good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,
4177520	4181840	but good and bad were originally the self-affirming values
4181840	4183280	of people with power.
4183280	4185680	So to be good meant to be powerful,
4185680	4187920	strong, beautiful, healthy,
4187920	4193120	and to be bad meant to be weak, sick, common, ugly.
4193120	4194240	I'm gonna eat one like a cat.
4195760	4198960	And Frederick supports this speculation with etymology.
4198960	4200160	So in a lot of languages,
4200160	4203120	the word that means morally good or spiritually noble
4203680	4206880	originally meant noble in the sense of aristocratic,
4206880	4208160	the propertied class.
4208880	4211280	Like in Buddhism, the Arya Satyani,
4211280	4213520	that's Sanskrit for noble truths.
4213520	4215440	Arya means noble.
4215440	4218320	And Arya is used to mean spiritually noble,
4218320	4221440	but earlier it meant the aristocracy, the rich.
4221440	4222800	And originally, it was just the name
4222800	4226560	that a culture in Northern India gave themselves, the Aryans.
4227200	4229440	I'm really working not to get soy sauce on this lace.
4229440	4232240	This was later misunderstood by Europeans
4232240	4235200	who wrongly thought that Aryan was a race.
4236880	4238960	Oops, goddammit.
4238960	4241360	Goddammit, kids, can we not?
4241360	4244560	Frederick traces the origin of the German word gut,
4244560	4247600	or the English good, to the name of the Goths.
4247600	4249200	No, not those Goths,
4249200	4251680	the Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.
4251680	4254800	Frederick calls them the blonde beasts of prey.
4254800	4258080	I like to stalk my prey in the small hours of the night.
4259280	4261680	The German word schlecht, which means bad,
4261680	4264400	is related to schlicht, which means plain,
4264480	4267360	simple, originally common, low,
4267360	4270000	not aristocratic, not noble.
4270000	4272880	So good and bad were originally the values
4272880	4274400	of warrior aristocrats,
4274400	4278000	who were like Homeric heroes celebrating themselves.
4278000	4281760	And Frederick calls their value system master morality,
4281760	4284960	this glorification of combat, feasting,
4284960	4288720	athleticism, sexual conquest, beauty.
4288720	4290400	These things were called good,
4290960	4293840	and their opposites, weakness, impotence,
4293840	4295840	ugliness, were called bad.
4295840	4298240	The ancient nobles worshiped noble gods
4298240	4300560	who acted like them and shared their values.
4300560	4302560	I mean, if I created a personal goddess,
4302560	4304560	I think we all know what animal that would be,
4304560	4306960	me and the ancient Egyptians on the same page.
4306960	4310320	So for example, Roman warriors could worship Mars,
4310320	4311440	the god of war,
4311440	4313600	and it was like they were worshiping themselves.
4313600	4316400	They were dumb jocks worshiping dumb jock gods.
4316400	4317520	Well, good for them,
4317520	4320800	but what about the people who got shoved into lockers?
4320800	4322800	Well, Frederick's example,
4322800	4325520	and this is gonna create some misunderstandings later,
4325520	4328400	but his example is the Jews,
4328400	4331200	who were colonized by the Romans in Judea.
4331200	4334480	And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try to revolt.
4334480	4337520	Oh, they did, multiple times.
4337520	4338720	But for several centuries,
4338720	4340640	the Romans were just too powerful.
4340640	4341840	No one could stop them.
4341840	4343120	So the question is,
4343120	4346640	what happens psychologically to people who are oppressed
4346640	4349360	and who lack the power to overthrow the oppressor?
4349360	4351360	Well, in that case,
4351360	4354160	frustrated vindictiveness builds over time
4354160	4356160	to become this deep bitterness,
4356160	4358160	which Nietzsche gave the French name
4358160	4360800	Résentiment, resentment in English.
4360800	4365600	Oui, eh, eh, oui, absolument, naturellement.
4365600	4366720	I don't speak French,
4366720	4368960	I just enjoy making vaguely French noises.
4368960	4372720	M'en, pas, quatre, eh, eh oui.
4372720	4373520	I don't like the English,
4373520	4374960	but I like the French even less.
4374960	4376240	Because they're always dressed so well
4376240	4378240	and they speak a sexier language than me.
4378240	4378880	Stop it.
4378880	4380640	This is your final warning, comprendez-vous?
4380640	4382080	Good wine though, I'll give them that.
4382080	4385600	So there's a German word, Neid, which means envy.
4385600	4389360	So why is Frederick using this French term, Résentiment?
4389360	4390800	What's going on, Frederick?
4390800	4391920	Why are you speaking French?
4392640	4393520	Are you nervous?
4393520	4394880	Are you trying to impress me?
4394880	4396880	Nietzsche must have said Résentiment,
4396880	4399440	because he thought it was something different than envy.
4399440	4401440	I think the difference is resentment,
4401440	4402640	and I'm just gonna use the English word
4402640	4404000	so I don't sound like an asshole,
4404000	4408160	resentment is born not just of wanting what someone has,
4408160	4412320	but of a permanent frustration of the desire for revenge.
4412320	4416000	It's born of weakness, inability to get revenge.
4416000	4418960	Now revenge itself implies weakness,
4418960	4420720	at least a temporary weakness.
4420720	4423440	We say revenge is best served cold,
4423440	4426640	but actually, revenge is only served cold.
4427360	4429760	If it's served hot, if someone slaps you
4429760	4431440	and you slap them back immediately,
4431440	4433920	that's retaliation, not revenge.
4434880	4436720	You brought this on yourself.
4436720	4438480	Revenge is only a possibility
4438480	4440800	when you can't retaliate immediately,
4440800	4444000	so you become vindictive, you start plotting and scheming.
4444000	4446560	But if you're too weak, too impotent
4446560	4450160	to have any hope of revenge, then you become resentful.
4450160	4451920	So Nietzsche's argument is that a person
4451920	4454560	who's too weak to get material revenge
4454560	4457600	can instead get psychological revenge
4457600	4459840	by creating a new morality.
4459840	4461040	In Frederick's words,
4461040	4464320	the beginning of the slave's revolt and morality
4464320	4467520	occurs when resentment itself turns creative
4467520	4469280	and gives birth to values.
4469280	4471760	This is a little high concept for a mukbang, isn't it?
4471760	4472800	What are you doing, Frederick?
4472800	4475520	So while master morality says that good
4475520	4478320	is power, riches, health, and strength,
4478320	4480320	and bad is the opposite,
4480320	4483040	slave morality, the morality of resentment,
4483040	4486000	says blessed are the poor, the meek,
4486000	4488080	the sick, the powerless.
4488080	4490640	This is the good of slave morality,
4490640	4492480	and its opposite is not the bad,
4492480	4495040	but a new concept, the evil.
4495040	4496320	And what is evil?
4496320	4499360	Well, everything that master morality says is good.
4500000	4504240	Power, wealth, conquest, sexual satisfaction.
4510640	4512320	He's talking about Christianity here,
4512320	4514240	he's not talking about Judaism.
4514240	4516080	But Frederick thinks of Christianity
4516080	4520080	as the spiritual revenge of the Jews against the Romans,
4520080	4522640	an inversion of the empire's values.
4522640	4524640	But he also thinks that slave morality
4524640	4526720	is fundamentally dishonest.
4526720	4528720	It's like the fox and the grapes.
4528720	4530960	Not being able to take revenge
4530960	4533920	is called not wanting to take revenge.
4533920	4536400	It might even be called forgiveness.
4536400	4540320	Slave morality says that weakness is righteous.
4540320	4544080	Submission to people you hate is called obedience.
4544080	4547360	Having to wait is called patience.
4547360	4549520	Inability to satisfy sexual desire
4549520	4553200	is called chastity, purity, and so on.
4553200	4556960	And while master morality is born of saying yes to yourself
4556960	4560240	as a powerful, noble beast of prey,
4560880	4564480	slave morality is born of saying no to the master
4564480	4566640	and everything he has that you can't.
4566640	4568800	I like to have my belly rubbed.
4568800	4571280	Scratch my back above my tail, please.
4571280	4572560	I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away
4572560	4574320	because it's getting warm and I'm full.
4574320	4576080	This has not been a successful mukbang.
4576080	4577920	It turns out that it's actually very difficult
4577920	4579920	to do a mukbang while talking.
4579920	4581520	I should've thought this through a little harder, hmm.
4581520	4584960	So slave morality is born of a repressed desire for revenge,
4584960	4587920	but that desire for revenge never completely disappears.
4587920	4589040	It's there, for example,
4589040	4591360	in the Christian idea of the last judgment.
4591360	4595200	No need to take revenge against the wicked, my sheep.
4595200	4596640	God will do that for us.
4596640	4601200	And in the meantime, being weak is good, actually.
4602080	4604800	I find this book thrilling to read, honestly,
4604800	4606480	and I'm not easily thrilled,
4606480	4608640	especially not by philosophers.
4608640	4610240	I think this book in particular gets me
4610240	4612880	because, especially if you were raised Christian,
4612880	4615440	this is so the opposite of everything
4615440	4616640	you were ever taught to believe
4616640	4619440	that it almost feels, like, dirty.
4619440	4620640	Should I be reading this?
4620640	4621920	Is this allowed?
4621920	4623120	Because even if you're not religious,
4623680	4626560	most of us still agree with a lot of Christian morality.
4626560	4628240	Like, yeah, Jesus was a good guy.
4629120	4630960	Blessed are the meek, sure.
4630960	4633120	But then Frederick comes along and he's like,
4633280	4637280	mm, morality is just a cope for frustrated vindictiveness.
4637280	4639360	And you're like, I need to lie down.
4639360	4640640	Where's my smelling salts?
4640640	4653680	But wait, there's more.
4653680	4655040	This gets even darker.
4655040	4656960	Nietzsche thinks that over the last two millennia
4656960	4660560	of European history, slave morality has triumphed.
4660640	4663200	St. Paul made Christianity marketable,
4663200	4665520	the Emperor Constantine converted,
4665520	4667120	and by the Middle Ages,
4667120	4669840	even kings and aristocrats were kneeling down
4669840	4673120	not to powerful warrior gods made in their own image,
4673120	4674880	but to a god that was weak,
4675520	4679040	suffering, victimized, oppressed.
4680720	4682080	So by the 19th century,
4682080	4685360	slave morality had become the only morality.
4685360	4687440	And it's not just Christianity, either.
4687440	4689600	The secular version of these values
4689600	4692000	became socialism, anarchism.
4692000	4694560	About free thinkers and atheists,
4694560	4696160	Nietzsche has this to say.
4696160	4698720	We loathe the church, not its poison.
4698720	4702000	Apart from the church, we too love the poison.
4702000	4703280	Okay, the poison.
4704000	4705360	What is the poison?
4705360	4709440	Well, Frederick thinks that resentment poisons the mind,
4709440	4712640	and turns humans against our own natural instincts.
4712640	4714080	Not just against aggression,
4714080	4716080	but against sexuality,
4716080	4717360	against ambition,
4717360	4718720	against power,
4718720	4720480	against life itself.
4720480	4722560	And there's two possible outcomes of this.
4722560	4726160	One is that resentment becomes a political movement,
4726160	4728560	the conspiracy of those who suffer,
4728560	4730320	the tyranny of the herd,
4730320	4732720	the revolution that eats itself.
4732720	4735440	Only we are good and just, is what they say.
4735440	4738160	As though health, success, strength, pride,
4738160	4741360	and the feeling of power were in themselves depravities
4741360	4743120	for which penance, bitter penance,
4743120	4744720	will one day be exacted.
4744720	4747520	Among them, we find plenty of vengeance seekers
4747520	4749200	disguised as judges,
4749200	4751440	with the word justice continually in their mouth
4751440	4753040	like poisonous spittle.
4753040	4756720	So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic resentment mob,
4756720	4758480	which I'm sure we're all familiar with.
4758480	4762160	The other outcome is that this moralism turns inward,
4762160	4764560	and attacks the individual conscience,
4764560	4768480	producing asceticism, self-denial, guilt.
4768480	4770240	Because slave morality condemns
4770240	4773840	not only the external beasts of prey who are oppressing us,
4773840	4777040	but also the beast of prey within,
4777040	4778880	our own animal instincts,
4778880	4780960	what Christianity calls sin.
4781520	4785440	So Frederick thinks that modern humans have become sick.
4785440	4788160	We hate ourselves, we hate our own nature,
4788880	4790640	we hate life itself.
4790640	4792720	I mean, is he wrong?
4792720	4794160	You see a girl boss winning,
4795200	4796800	I only see the will to power.
4797360	4801200	Frederick thinks of modern men as once-proud wildcats
4801200	4803920	who've become domesticated house pets,
4803920	4807120	at the cost of everything great in the human spirit.
4807760	4810880	That's very valid, Frederick.
4811440	4814800	That's super hecking valid.
4814800	4817600	So look, I've been pretty positive about Nietzsche so far,
4817600	4819840	but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.
4819840	4823280	One is that Frederick associating slave morality
4823280	4826000	with the Jews is very irresponsible.
4826000	4828240	Even though he didn't intend to be antisemitic,
4828240	4830720	and even though he was outspoken against antisemitism
4830720	4831600	in his own time,
4831600	4834000	when you keep referring to the Christian values
4834000	4837760	you're critiquing as Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge,
4838640	4840480	some people might get the wrong idea.
4840480	4842080	And some people did, Frederick.
4842080	4844560	Like your dumbass sister, Elizabeth Nietzsche,
4844560	4849040	who became a literal alternative ethno-identitarian.
4849040	4850160	God damn it, Liz.
4850160	4851760	Kind of goth goals, though.
4851760	4853280	Yes, that kind of goth.
4853280	4854240	You're right this time.
4854240	4856480	My other critique is that it doesn't seem to have occurred
4856480	4859760	to Frederick that genuinely caring about other people
4859840	4860720	is an option.
4860720	4862560	Like not because caring about other people
4862560	4865040	is repressing your true selfish nature,
4865040	4867280	but just because caring about other people
4867280	4868880	is part of your nature.
4868880	4870000	And isn't it?
4870000	4872960	Isn't caring about other people also in our nature?
4872960	4875920	I do think most of what Nietzsche says about resentment
4875920	4878720	accurately describes a very real thing.
4878720	4880560	But it's not the only thing.
4880560	4883440	There is genuine care and love in this world,
4883440	4884320	I've been told.
4884320	4885440	I've heard rumors.
4885440	4887200	And I'm even gonna go so far as to say
4887200	4889120	hashtag not all Christians.
4889120	4890720	Christ, I'm defending the Christians.
4890720	4892240	What is this channel coming to?
4892240	4894720	There are Christians, maybe not most,
4894720	4898080	but still some, for whom love and forgiveness
4898080	4900000	are genuine experiences,
4900000	4902640	and not just some kind of twisted,
4902640	4905360	impotent, passive-aggressive vengeance.
4905360	4907920	Where I agree with Nietzsche, and with Freud,
4907920	4910720	is I do think a lot of the emotional foundation
4910720	4914560	of justice and morality is retribution,
4915120	4917840	envy, or some combination of the two.
4917840	4920000	But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.
4920000	4921920	There's a famous Martin Luther King quote
4921920	4923440	responding to Nietzsche.
4923440	4925680	What is needed is a realization
4926320	4930080	that power without love is reckless and abusive,
4930080	4933520	and that love without power is sentimental and anemic.
4934160	4936720	Power at its best is love
4937600	4940320	implementing the demands of justice,
4940320	4944720	and justice at its best is love correcting everything
4944720	4946320	that stands against love.
4946560	4950000	So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche
4950000	4954800	that to simply call power evil is a sickness, anemic.
4954800	4957040	But there still needs to be some kind of emotional
4957040	4959440	or spiritual force that keeps humanity
4959440	4961120	from tearing itself apart.
4961120	4963760	And maybe something like this Christian idea
4963760	4966160	of love for humanity is the missing piece.
4966160	4968000	Because without something like that,
4968000	4971440	I just see retribution and envy snowballing
4971440	4973280	into human self-destruction.
4973280	4974720	And I hate that for us.
4974720	4976320	It's not very sliving of us.
4976320	4977600	Do you guys know about sliving?
4977600	4980160	Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's YouTube channel?
4980160	4982000	She doesn't have as many subscribers as I do,
4982000	4984720	but you know, I try to support smaller creators.
4984720	4988240	Sliving is basically slaying and living your best life
4988240	4989040	into one word.
4989040	4990000	It's the new that's hot.
4990560	4992160	Maybe I'll do a video about love
4992160	4993680	when I'm in a better mood.
4993680	4996960	So for now, well, let's put it this way.
4996960	5000240	God is dead, and we have killed him, yeah?
5001200	5001760	Sliving!
5001840	5002320	Sliving!
5018960	5021040	Okay, I'm moisturized.
5021040	5021920	I'm primed.
5021920	5024000	I've proven my academic credentials.
5024000	5025520	Now it's time to do my makeup.
5025520	5026480	That's right, children.
5026480	5028320	I'm going full Bailey Sarian.
5028320	5030720	I'm going full suspish.
5030720	5032080	So I guess I should say something
5032080	5034320	about the political implications of all this,
5034320	5037120	since I guess this channel is about politics.
5037120	5039440	Sometimes I have to read my own Wikipedia article
5039440	5041280	to remember what I'm doing with my life.
5041280	5043520	So this morality of resentment,
5043520	5046720	of impotence, and permanently frustrated revenge
5047280	5050240	judges that power is evil.
5050240	5051200	I don't use foundation.
5051200	5052400	I just use concealer.
5052400	5054480	I know that's like not how you're supposed to do makeup,
5054480	5056080	but I don't need to be good at makeup, okay?
5056080	5058160	I have a million subscribers on YouTube.
5058160	5059680	I don't need to be good.
5059680	5060960	There was a New York Times article
5060960	5063760	about young women's attitudes toward political ambition,
5063760	5065760	and one of the women who was interviewed said,
5065760	5069200	as a white woman, I know I have unearned privilege.
5069200	5072240	So am I really the best person to be in leadership?
5072240	5073840	Uh, yes.
5073840	5074560	Yes, you are.
5074560	5076400	Because we need leaders like you
5076400	5078240	who are capable of questioning
5078240	5080320	the legitimacy of their own authority.
5080320	5082160	Otherwise, we're just gonna be stuck
5082160	5084160	with another blonde beast of prey.
5084160	5087120	And of course it's good to be aware of your privilege,
5087120	5088480	especially as a leader,
5088480	5090640	but let's not be so self-effacing
5090640	5093360	that we efface ourselves off the face of the earth.
5093360	5096880	This is the self-sabotage of resentment values.
5096880	5098800	If you think power is evil,
5098800	5101920	then you've given up on the ambition to acquire any power,
5101920	5104960	which virtually guarantees your political irrelevance,
5104960	5106640	since, like MLK said,
5106640	5108800	you have to at least have some power
5108800	5111040	to implement the demands of justice.
5111040	5114080	Remember what incels call taking the black pill,
5114080	5116800	this conviction that the reason you don't have a girlfriend
5116800	5119200	is just that you're genetically undesirable.
5119200	5120880	There's nothing you can do to change it,
5120880	5123440	and I guess women are just too shallow
5123440	5126080	to be attracted to all the amazing hatred and spite
5126080	5127760	that festers in your heart.
5127760	5129520	For a lot of black-pilled incels,
5129520	5131760	it seems like there's only one thing left in life
5131760	5132720	that they enjoy,
5133360	5136000	which is simply the pleasure of complaining,
5136000	5137760	of moaning in pain.
5137760	5140960	It reminds me of a comment from Dostoevsky's
5140960	5142640	second most horrible protagonist.
5147120	5157680	The moan is a protest against the meaninglessness of pain,
5157680	5160320	and part of the satisfaction of moaning
5160320	5163120	is inflicting your pain on other people.
5163120	5165040	This kind of malignant moaning,
5165680	5167680	it's kind of the opposite of music,
5167680	5170000	because a lot of music, like blues,
5170000	5173840	is benevolent moaning that transforms pain into pleasure.
5173840	5175360	I mean, that's what blues is all about.
5175360	5176800	My woman don't love me no more,
5176800	5178240	but I know her sister will.
5178240	5179840	You know, optimism.
5179840	5181520	I think a lot of incel discourse
5181520	5183920	is really just malignant moaning, right?
5183920	5187280	It's not an attempt to diagnose or solve any problem.
5187280	5189760	It's just a contagious expression of misery,
5189760	5193680	a moan of pain that masquerades as a political agenda.
5193680	5195760	Sexual Marxism, they call it.
5195760	5197760	The redistribution of sex.
5197760	5199840	State-mandated GFs.
5199840	5201760	That's very valid.
5201760	5204240	Of course, they don't actually expect any of this to happen.
5204960	5206320	That's not the point.
5206320	5209680	So incels are kind of a universal punching bag online.
5209680	5212320	It's very easy to point and laugh at them,
5212320	5214720	but what's harder is to look in the mirror
5214720	5217440	and notice how these exact same tendencies
5217440	5219520	are rampant in our own communities.
5219520	5222000	So the incel black pill is just one instance
5222000	5224800	of what I call an ideology of resentment,
5224800	5226800	a discourse that outwardly appears
5226800	5228640	like moral or political critique,
5228640	5232560	but which on examination is mainly just a resentful moan.
5232560	5234320	The goal of resentment politics
5234320	5236400	is not to improve conditions.
5236400	5240000	In fact, the resentful person is full of contempt
5240000	5243200	for any morally compromised sellouts
5243200	5245840	who are attempting to enact plausible reforms.
5245840	5247360	They don't want victory.
5247360	5248560	They don't want power.
5248560	5251360	They want to endlessly critique power.
5251360	5254000	Because for them, critique is an important
5254000	5258560	psychological defense against feeling impotent.
5258560	5260240	Schaler described it this way.
5260320	5262800	It is peculiar to resentment criticism
5262800	5264400	that it does not seriously desire
5264400	5266000	that its demands be fulfilled.
5266000	5267600	It does not want to cure the evil.
5267600	5270320	The evil is merely a pretext for the criticism.
5270320	5271920	What am I going to do with my eyes?
5271920	5273840	I think a pink kind of look.
5273840	5275280	We've been doing a lot of pink looks.
5275280	5277280	I just, I love that hay fever look.
5277280	5278720	As a general rule,
5278720	5282000	the more radical a political community claims to be,
5282000	5285280	the more likely it is to be a community of resentment.
5285280	5287200	Self-styled radicals will tell you
5287200	5290400	superficial surface reforms do not interest us.
5290400	5293120	The problem must be critiqued at its root.
5293120	5295920	And then the root turns out to be this universal,
5295920	5298000	all-encompassing evil, right?
5298000	5299520	Society itself.
5299520	5300480	The system.
5300480	5301520	The machine.
5301520	5304320	A resentment ideologue always imagines himself
5304320	5307440	to be engaged in a kind of satanic revolt
5307440	5310880	against an omnipotent, omnipresent enemy.
5310880	5312880	Okay, I just need to do makeup for a second.
5312880	5314640	It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.
5314640	5316000	It's hard to talk while doing this.
5316000	5318320	And nothing short of total revolution
5318320	5320560	counts as any sort of victory whatsoever.
5320560	5322880	We have to dismantle the entire system.
5323680	5324880	Burn it all down.
5324880	5326960	I guess it's pedestrian to point out
5326960	5329760	that this is the revolutionary utopian equivalent
5329760	5331840	of Christians awaiting the last judgment.
5331840	5333840	Our kingdom is coming, comrades.
5333840	5336480	Often the appeal of utopian ideology
5336480	5337920	is similar to religion.
5337920	5341200	It's not about healthcare, higher wages,
5341200	5343360	relief from police violence.
5343360	5346240	Those are actual goals that could be demanded,
5346240	5347760	worked for, and achieved.
5347760	5351040	Utopian ideology instead promises relief
5351040	5355360	from some general malaise, alienation.
5355360	5358560	And so ironically, it can have the same opiate effect
5358560	5360640	that Marx ascribes to religion.
5360640	5364080	But release from the general anguish of human existence
5364080	5365680	is not a political goal.
5365680	5368800	There's been many revolutions in the last few centuries,
5368800	5371440	and so far, zero utopias.
5371440	5375280	Resentment, envy, and hunger, for that matter,
5375280	5378640	are not satiated by the downfall of the old regime.
5378640	5381440	When the people have no bread, they eat the rich.
5382640	5386240	And when the rich are gone, they eat each other.
5386240	5388240	And because of the proximity effect,
5388240	5391200	envy may actually increase after the revolution.
5391200	5394560	You may actually be more envious of a favored comrade,
5394560	5398320	a successful citoyen, oui, a kulak,
5398320	5400400	than you ever were of the aristocrats.
5400400	5403840	So envy turns paranoid and imaginative
5403840	5405600	in revolutionary moments.
5405600	5408240	It gets sublimated into morality,
5408240	5410720	and the accusations start flying.
5410720	5413680	That citizen is conspiring against the revolution.
5413680	5415680	That peasant is hoarding grain.
5415680	5418720	So the guillotine starts slicing thousands of heads off,
5418720	5420160	the gulags fill up.
5420160	5423120	For an authoritarian, strongman takes over
5423120	5426560	just to announce another revolution two decades later.
5426560	5429440	The things people will do to stay relevant, honestly.
5429440	5430240	And for what?
5430240	5433840	What long-term egalitarian utopia results?
5433840	5436000	Socialism with Chinese characteristics?
5436000	5440800	So look, I do understand that sometimes
5440800	5442400	you just have to do a revolution.
5442400	5444240	And if I'd been there in 1789,
5444960	5447120	I'm sure I'd be storming the Bastille myself.
5447120	5449600	But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.
5449600	5451280	Revolution is a bloody nightmare
5451280	5453440	that happens because society is collapsing
5453440	5454720	and people are desperate.
5454720	5457120	At worst, revolution is nothing more
5457120	5459120	than a violent day of retribution.
5459120	5460960	And at best, it lays the groundwork
5460960	5463040	for future incremental progress.
5463040	5464960	But it will never usher in utopia,
5464960	5467280	nor is it the antidote to a vague sense of unease,
5467280	5468800	which, I'm sorry to report,
5469360	5472640	is simply the resting state of an unsedated human mind.
5472640	5476000	Now I'm not saying, as some conservatives do,
5476000	5478960	that all leftist or all egalitarian politics
5478960	5480240	is born of envy.
5480240	5480740	No.
5481120	5483200	This is a specific subtype.
5483200	5484960	There are plenty of reasons,
5484960	5487120	other than envy or fear of envy,
5487120	5489280	to oppose an economic distribution
5489280	5491440	where some people have billions of dollars
5491440	5492640	while other people are dying
5492640	5494160	because they can't afford insulin.
5494160	5497360	Objectively, that is not an efficient use of resources
5497360	5498880	to promote human well-being.
5498880	5502000	And personally, I just don't want to live in a country
5502000	5504560	where people are dying because they can't afford medicine.
5504560	5507360	And I'm willing to pay however many taxes it takes
5507360	5508880	for that not to happen.
5508880	5512320	So while I'm putting down strawman versions of my argument,
5512320	5514080	I'm also not saying,
5514080	5516240	oh, let's just stop being envious.
5516320	5516820	No.
5517120	5518080	That's impossible.
5518080	5520000	I think envy is like libido.
5520000	5522160	It's a basic force of human nature
5522160	5524400	that's more or less unstoppable.
5524400	5525920	But with the right leadership,
5525920	5529520	I think that envy can potentially be sublimated
5529520	5532640	or redirected into something more constructive.
5532640	5535920	Because raw envy is a very bad basis
5535920	5537600	for egalitarian politics.
5537600	5539360	It often targets the wrong people,
5539360	5541280	like millionaires instead of billionaires,
5541280	5544080	and eventually it turns the revolution against itself
5544080	5546000	and you get the circular firing squad.
5546000	5547440	The self-cannibalism.
5547440	5549680	The problem I see on the left today
5549680	5552160	is that without any genuine political outlet,
5552160	5555040	resentment mostly manifests as morality.
5555040	5557840	Morality itself being a way to vent
5557840	5559840	envious aggression and vindictiveness.
5559840	5562480	On the left, we claim to be so impersonal, right?
5562480	5564800	We're all about structural analysis,
5564800	5566800	the material conditions,
5566800	5568240	systems of power,
5568240	5570640	intersectional identity hierarchies.
5570640	5571760	But if you look at what people
5571760	5573760	actually spend their time doing here,
5573760	5576480	it's all this obsessive moral policing.
5576480	5579120	I wonder if because leftists can't seem to win
5579120	5581040	on any major political stage,
5581040	5582560	we feel disempowered.
5582560	5584640	And so this moral fanaticism
5585200	5586800	is a psychological substitute.
5586800	5588400	Like with Marie Antoinette,
5588400	5591120	it's easier to blame people than systems.
5591120	5594480	Also, structural analysis is very boring,
5594480	5596320	and destroying people with gossip
5596320	5597920	is extremely entertaining.
5597920	5600880	This obsessive moral policing
5600880	5602560	also gets turned inward
5602560	5604400	and becomes leftist guilt.
5604400	5607760	You know, this useless internalized scolding.
5607760	5609120	I think I'm done with my makeup.
5609120	5610000	What do we think?
5610000	5610800	Leave a comment.
5610800	5612960	I'm always hesitant to do anything about skincare
5612960	5614240	since last time I did skincare,
5614240	5615760	I was critiqued by Hyram.
5615760	5617760	So I am going to spray my face a couple times
5617760	5620400	with this Tatcha skin mist,
5620400	5622000	if that's okay with Hyram.
5622000	5623840	It feels good to finally address this feud.
5623840	5624560	Clear the air.
5626160	5627760	I look a lot better with makeup.
5627760	5629600	I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,
5629600	5631360	it's just that it's very much enhanced
5631360	5634400	by painting a different face on top of my face.
5634400	5636320	But hey, at least this way I've kind of like,
5636320	5637600	I've kind of earned it, you know,
5637600	5638800	because it's my skill.
5638800	5641120	So there's a podcast called Guilty Feminist
5641120	5642640	that's been running for years,
5642640	5643840	and I haven't listened in a while,
5643840	5645120	but in the early episodes,
5645120	5646320	they'd bring on these women
5646320	5648960	who would confess their feminist sins.
5648960	5649760	You know,
5649760	5651040	hi, my name is Amber,
5651840	5653120	I'm a feminist,
5653120	5656080	but I enjoy being choked in bed.
5657360	5658560	It's hard being a woman.
5658560	5660160	Not only are you being choked,
5660160	5661920	you also feel guilty about it.
5661920	5664000	The same moral hand-wringing
5664000	5665840	happens with body positivity.
5665840	5667360	When you make loving your body
5667360	5669280	into a moral imperative,
5669280	5671360	not only are you still going to hate your body,
5671360	5673440	but now you're also going to feel guilty
5673440	5674640	about hating your body
5674640	5676400	because it makes you a bad feminist.
5676400	5677840	So there was one problem,
5677840	5679360	and now there's two problems.
5679360	5680640	Thanks, morality.
5680640	5682320	That's very helpful.
5682320	5684160	Now I want to take a moment to acknowledge
5684160	5687200	that a lot of conservatives have made some version
5687200	5689360	of the argument I'm making in this video.
5689360	5690480	For example,
5690480	5692720	Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia
5692720	5695440	have argued that academic postmodernists
5695440	5697040	are motivated by resentment.
5697040	5698320	The argument is that
5698320	5700480	deconstructionist literary theory
5700480	5702720	is a kind of envious vengeance
5702720	5704640	against the beauty and virtuosity
5704640	5706400	of canonical great art.
5706400	5708400	And yeah, there's probably some truth to that.
5708400	5710560	A lot of academics are failed artists,
5710560	5712320	but I was even more manqué than that.
5712320	5714240	I've noticed that working class,
5714240	5715920	non-academic socialists
5715920	5718080	do tend to be more productive
5718080	5719440	and more self-advancing,
5719440	5721440	involved in unionizing or organizing.
5721440	5724640	Whereas, it's usually people who went to college.
5724640	5726160	I went to college!
5727840	5729280	Presumably because they had
5729280	5731600	middle-class ambitions at some point,
5731600	5734000	but whose middle-class ambitions have failed,
5734000	5736720	who become the great critiquers of capital.
5736720	5738320	I mean, I can tell you from experience
5738320	5740000	that when I was eating Chef Boyardee
5740000	5741280	over my master's degree,
5741280	5743360	that's when I was most likely to say things like,
5743360	5745280	according to Antonio Gramsci,
5745280	5747520	in the logic of late-stage capitalism,
5747520	5750320	the culturally hegemonic neoliberal ideology
5750320	5753120	manufactures the consent of the civil term.
5753120	5754640	Uh, so point taken.
5754640	5758160	But some conservatives take this argument way too far,
5758160	5760000	and try to argue that the entire left
5760000	5762320	is nothing but a coalition of resentment.
5762320	5763840	Like, there's a video on YouTube
5763840	5766080	of the philosophy professor Stephen Hicks
5766080	5768080	doing a version of the post-modernism
5768080	5769520	is resentment argument,
5769520	5770640	and in the comments section,
5770640	5772160	there's a bunch of people saying,
5772160	5774480	this describes Black Lives Matter,
5774480	5777200	Antifa, and the Democrats.
5777200	5778080	Does it, though?
5778080	5779600	I mean, any political movement
5779600	5781040	is gonna have people in it
5781040	5782880	who suffer from resentment poisoning.
5782880	5785600	But Black Lives Matter, at its core,
5785600	5788480	is about the right not to be murdered by police.
5788480	5790640	The slogan, Black Lives Matter,
5790640	5793840	is an affirmation of the value of black life.
5793840	5796800	So that seems like something even Nietzsche would approve of.
5796800	5799760	Huey Newton, the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,
5799760	5801280	was inspired by Nietzsche
5801280	5804080	to create the slogan All Power to the People.
5804080	5806800	When we coined the expression All Power to the People,
5806800	5809200	we had in mind emphasizing the word power,
5809200	5811280	for we recognize that the will to power
5811280	5812880	is the basic drive of man,
5812880	5815520	but it is incorrect to seek power over people.
5815520	5818160	We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing power
5818160	5821200	of exploitation and racism for hundreds of years,
5821200	5824080	and the black community has its will to power also.
5824080	5827040	What we seek, however, is not power over people,
5827040	5830080	but the power of control of our own destiny.
5830080	5832000	That, to me, is a role model
5832000	5833840	for how to do identity politics
5833840	5835600	without centering resentment.
5835600	5838880	It's instead an affirmation of self-determination
5838880	5840000	and self-respect.
5840000	5842800	Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying yes to yourself.
5842800	5844640	Whereas if your whole political project
5844640	5846160	is defined in the negative,
5846160	5847360	then you're allowing yourself
5847360	5848960	to be defined by your enemies.
5848960	5850800	I find feminism is prone to this,
5850800	5852800	where even, and in fact especially,
5852800	5854560	the most radical feminists
5854560	5857120	cannot seem to escape this resentful consciousness
5857120	5858720	of being the second sex
5858720	5861280	and defining themselves against men.
5861280	5864240	Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a positive way.
5864240	5866560	She's the most radical of radical feminists,
5866560	5869440	and my first impulse is actually to defend her
5869440	5871680	because she's very widely hated,
5871680	5874720	and most of the people who hate her hate a caricature.
5874720	5876480	Like in that Stephen Hicks video,
5876480	5878160	Hicks summarizes Dworkin as
5878160	5881360	calling all heterosexual males rapists.
5881360	5884720	Literally in the preface to her most famous book,
5884720	5885920	Dworkin says,
5885920	5888800	If one's sexual experience has always,
5888800	5891920	and without exception, been based on dominance,
5891920	5894160	how could one understand that this book
5894160	5896720	does not say that all men are rapists
5896720	5898800	or that all intercourse is rape?
5898800	5901280	Listen, Hicks, I get that you're a full professor
5901280	5902800	and I'm just a makeup vlogger,
5902800	5905040	but my gut feeling on this one is,
5905040	5906400	before criticizing a book,
5907200	5908720	maybe read the book.
5908720	5909600	Just a thought.
5909600	5910640	Get it together, prof.
5910640	5913120	You're being owned online by a makeup vlogger.
5913120	5914240	I mean, there's no shame in that.
5914240	5915440	It happens to me all the time.
5915440	5916400	That being said,
5916400	5920000	I do think that Hicks is coincidentally correct
5920080	5922400	that Dworkin is a theorist of resentment.
5922400	5924720	What Dworkin does say in this book
5924720	5926560	is arguably even more bleak
5926560	5928320	than what is falsely attributed to her.
5928320	5930080	The book is called Intercourse.
5930080	5931760	She wrote a book called Intercourse.
5931760	5933680	Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.
5933680	5934960	I can actually easily imagine that.
5934960	5935520	Never mind.
5935520	5939120	So this is an argument about the meaning of sex.
5939120	5941040	Penetration, to be specific.
5941040	5944880	Dworkin argues that penetration expresses domination,
5944880	5949120	invasion, occupation, possession, contempt, degradation.
5949120	5951040	So it's against the Freudian
5951040	5953680	male castration anxiety interpretation,
5953680	5957520	where it's a fear of being devoured by the woman.
5957520	5958800	Imagine being afraid of that.
5958800	5960560	Imagine being afraid of that.
5960560	5963120	I'm gonna get a facelift someday
5963120	5964240	and I'm gonna look like this.
5966960	5967680	I'm perfect.
5968400	5970560	I certainly don't agree with everything she says,
5970560	5973040	but isn't Dworkin closer to the truth here?
5973040	5974640	Closer than Freud, anyway.
5974640	5978400	Think about what men typically say to women during the act.
5978400	5979680	Do they say,
5979680	5981040	Hell, I'm being devoured.
5981760	5982800	Never heard that one.
5982800	5983440	Have you?
5983440	5985280	No, usually it's more along the lines of,
5986000	5987520	You like that, don't you?
5987520	5988400	You little.
5988400	5989040	Et cetera.
5989040	5993600	And of course, you can eroticize being subjugated and degraded and enjoy it.
5993600	5997200	And I think Dworkin would argue that most women do eroticize subjugation
5997200	5998400	because they're taught to.
5998400	6001280	But enjoying it, she'd have to say,
6001280	6003840	doesn't change the meaning of what's happening.
6003840	6006160	So I think Dworkin says some things that are very true
6006160	6007920	and some things that are off the fucking rails.
6008000	6010800	Where she loses me is where she starts getting blackpilled.
6010800	6013680	And this book, this is the feminist blackpill.
6013680	6017280	It is 250 pages of hopeless misery and rage.
6017280	6018080	She says,
6018080	6022160	Male-dominant gender hierarchy seems immune to reform.
6022160	6026320	This may be because intercourse itself is immune to reform.
6026320	6027120	Uh, okay.
6027120	6031360	So women will never be free until men stop putting the P in the V.
6032560	6034160	We can dream, Andrea.
6034160	6035120	We can dream.
6035120	6036960	Like most ideology of resentment,
6036960	6040800	this book is totally dismissive of any plausible reforms
6040800	6043440	that might actually improve the situation of women.
6043440	6046880	Instead, preferring to wallow in the endless violence,
6046880	6048560	filth, and abjection of it all.
6048560	6052160	I also think it's symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a lesbian,
6052160	6054960	but in that second wave political way.
6054960	6056240	Quoting from the foreword,
6056240	6059920	To Dworkin, it was a badge of rebellion against the patriarchy.
6059920	6061760	In 30 plus years of knowing her,
6061760	6065040	I've never heard of a single romance with a woman, not one.
6065040	6069600	This is not surprising to me from the author of a 250 page book about sex
6069600	6074720	that not once pauses to even imagine the possibility of intimacy between women.
6074720	6077840	Because it's not a lesbianism that's about saying yes to women,
6077840	6080960	it's a lesbianism that's about saying no to men.
6080960	6083840	You know, people think that lesbians are the biggest man-haters,
6083840	6085120	but I don't think that's true.
6085120	6088800	I think lesbians just don't think about men that much.
6088800	6093600	The only men I think about are Fred Nietzsche and, uh, Oedipus the King.
6093600	6096160	It's straight women who are usually the real man-haters,
6096160	6097680	because they're stuck with this,
6097680	6100400	and love is closer to hatred than neutrality.
6100400	6102640	So what does Andrea Dworkin actually want?
6102640	6105440	What would she say yes to if she said yes to anything?
6105440	6107360	Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,
6107360	6108800	because no one ever told them they could.
6109600	6110240	Romance.
6110960	6114160	That's what Joan Didion said is the real desire of the women's movement.
6114160	6116400	Joan Didion, of course, being not like other girls.
6116400	6119600	Dworkin offers occasional glimpses of a positive desire.
6119600	6123040	Despite all efforts to socialize women to want intercourse,
6123040	6125840	women still want a more diffuse and tender sensuality
6125840	6128800	that involves the whole body in a polymorphous tenderness.
6128800	6130000	That does sound nice.
6130000	6130960	I'm so lonely.
6132000	6134880	I think it's a bit bold to speak for all women, though.
6134880	6137600	Like, there are definitely women out there who, uh,
6137600	6139920	they don't make love, Anastasia.
6139920	6142160	They f*** hard.
6142160	6146320	I'm really sleepy, and this bed right behind me just looks so nice.
6146320	6147920	I can't in here right now.
6147920	6150480	What if I just go to sleep, and then wake up,
6150480	6152880	and then just record the rest of the video when I wake up.
6152880	6153840	I don't want to do it now.
6153840	6156000	I'll get Pikachu, that'll make this easier.
6156000	6157440	Isn't it better for me to have a friend?
6157440	6159600	Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.
6159600	6160080	Why?
6160080	6161440	Because he's the yellowest.
6161440	6163600	Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.
6163600	6164320	You can't name anything.
6164320	6165360	You can't think of anything.
6165360	6169120	So if diffuse and tender sensuality is what you want,
6169120	6170320	then just say that.
6170320	6171680	Is that what you want, Pikachu?
6172560	6173680	I bet it is.
6173680	6175200	And Dworkin did get married.
6175920	6177120	To a gay man.
6177120	6178960	So I guess she found what she wanted.
6179760	6180240	Lucky.
6183040	6184640	Envying Andrea Dworkin.
6184640	6186560	Is that really what we've sunk to around here?
6186560	6190800	You know, I've been noticing the poison creeping into my mind lately.
6190800	6194240	I know this isn't very original, but I had a bad year.
6194240	6197520	You know, I fell in love with my best friend like a gay idiot,
6197520	6200320	got my heart comprehensively broken,
6200320	6204160	and then COVID hit and gave me a year of solitude to
6204160	6207280	spiral deeper into a hell of my own making.
6207280	6209280	You know, I stopped saying yes to life,
6209280	6212320	and I started saying yes to chasing the dragon.
6212320	6215120	By which I mean playing Spyro the Dragon,
6215120	6219600	one of the greatest appropriate-for-all-ages video games of all time.
6219600	6221760	Look at him go!
6221760	6222880	I'm taking the hair clips out.
6222880	6225840	I catch myself having bitter spinster thoughts.
6225840	6227520	It's because I'm trans.
6227520	6229040	It's because I'm gay.
6229040	6230560	That's why I'll die alone.
6230560	6232160	Yeah, that's the reason I'm alone.
6232160	6234320	Definitely not because I don't leave the house.
6234320	6238800	See, I am not immune to incel-tier brain poisoning,
6238800	6244320	and you really can use political theorizing as an excuse not to fix your life.
6244320	6246640	Society did this to me.
6246640	6250400	A transphobic society made me hate myself.
6250400	6253520	Well, yeah, that's true.
6253520	6258160	But at a certain point, you have to take responsibility for your own mind,
6258160	6261680	and decide to stop being an accomplice in your own annihilation.
6261680	6263680	Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,
6263680	6265280	the mind is its own place,
6265280	6268080	and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven.
6268080	6269040	Yes, squad.
6269040	6272640	So I ask myself, what kind of mind do I want to be?
6272640	6275120	Do I want to obsess over what I lack,
6275120	6278000	concede society's judgment of my inferiority,
6278000	6282400	become a self-hating, self-pitying, envious, resentful little nothing?
6282400	6286240	Or do I want to get off the goddamn floor,
6286240	6289760	stop chasing the dragon, and say yes to life?
6289760	6294480	The answer, of course, is that I long to return to the sweet womb of my dark mother.
6294480	6295920	But we're not gonna do that,
6295920	6298960	because there's plenty of time to numb the pain after you die.
6298960	6301840	The sweet embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.
6301840	6308880	Also, nothing is less attractive than an envious, resentful, self-pitying person.
6308880	6311200	It's beyond a personality flaw,
6311200	6316560	it's a personality deformity that can ruin whatever chance at happiness you have.
6316560	6318960	So in the short time that you're alive,
6318960	6323920	you have to discover that which is noble in yourself, and say yes to it.
6323920	6327920	You know, don't say no to getting older, say yes to being a MILF.
6327920	6329600	Yes, yes.
6329600	6331120	What I'm really trying to say here is,
6331760	6334400	Spongebob Squarepants is the Ubermensch.
6334400	6337600	Spongebob says yes to life, and so should we.
6337600	6339120	Yes to ourselves.
6339120	6340160	Yes to art.
6340160	6341680	Yes to sensuality.
6341680	6343200	Yes to the world.
6343200	6344080	Yes.
6344080	6345040	Yes.
6345040	6346400	Eh, we.
6347360	6348960	Is this really how we're ending the video?
6350000	6351120	I guess.
6351120	6352480	Okay, bye!
6352480	6368640	🎶
6368640	6371040	Oh, so what if my fantasies make no sense?
6371040	6373040	You wanna talk about things that don't make sense?
6373040	6374240	Heterosexuality.
6374240	6376320	Let's put that under the microscope, hmm?
6376320	6379040	You want me to believe that a straight woman,
6379040	6381840	who knows the difference between magenta and mauve,
6381840	6385680	is gonna date a straight man who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,
6385680	6387520	and that's just gonna work out fine.
6387520	6390000	You think it's safe to raise a child in that environment?
6390960	6392000	I don't think so.
6392000	6393200	Not on my watch.
6393200	6395440	See, I think straight men should date each other.
6395440	6398640	They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox and then f*** each other.
6398640	6400880	And then straight women can pair off,
6400880	6402480	decoupage some shit,
6402480	6403920	and eat each other out.
6403920	6404880	Isn't that better?
6404880	6406080	Isn't that more rational?
6406080	6407840	I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.
6407840	6410640	Like, I wish I had anatomical control over them.
6410640	6411140	Hello?
6411680	6412960	Yes, Dr. Spiegel?
6413520	6414480	Yes, it's me again.
6415280	6416480	I have a suggestion.
6416480	6417280	What do we even have here?
6417280	6422880	We've got tuna, salmon, some squid, mackerel, shrimp,
6423920	6428160	some, I think it's yellowtail, clam, some rolls.
6428160	6429600	I've never been as much into rolls.
6429600	6431120	I'm a cat, you know I like fish.
6431120	6433840	You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.
6433840	6436640	It's an affront to my feline nature.
6464720	6472640	So
6472640	6495600	Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
