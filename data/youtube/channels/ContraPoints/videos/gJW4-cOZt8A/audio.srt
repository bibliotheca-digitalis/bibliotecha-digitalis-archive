1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
yourself questions.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,360
Why is the world bad?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,560
What did all these people die for?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,680
Well, for freedom, I guess.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,680
And like, American values?

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,280
But what are those values?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,560
but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
anyway.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Ugh.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,000
Fuckin' neoliberalism?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,120
What even goes on in these big buildings?

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,440
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,160
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,680
cream off the interns?

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
What the hell even is this country?

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
It's just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,800
Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Dave & Buster's.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,160
I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,720
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's, of course I want the fucking lava

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
cakes.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Oh goddammit, it was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,480
I feel like capitalism made me do.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,600
Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,120
of people have that feeling.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,840
But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,200
The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,440
There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,720
sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,520
they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,680
The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,000
adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
world of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,000
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
homeland.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,760
But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,960
do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,280
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,640
So the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
cucks.

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,000
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers, capitalism did.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,880
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,960
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
reptiles.

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,560
Chapter One, Capitalism and Spirit.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,880
Oh god I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,440
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,160
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,400
A leftist could easily have said that.

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,600
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
to it too.

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,360
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,100
under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates

63
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,120
the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,520
objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of lies and

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,320
increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,160
No I don't want a landline, no one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,000
Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,040
notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meaning in ancient customs,

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
And that shit's not really my scene, I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
person.

73
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,800
But I think that capitalism as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
And here's why.

75
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,080
Chapter Two, Alienated Labor.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Ugh this Marxist jargon sucks, let's come up with something new.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
Chapter Two, Shitty Jobs.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,080
Why is your job so shitty?

79
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,200
Well probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,960
you spend your day dealing with whiny entitled white bitches who don't understand that

81
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
you're just a lackey without any actual power.

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,840
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
at each other.

84
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,060
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

86
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
a gear.

87
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,860
The CEO makes 36 million dollars a year, while you make 14 dollars an hour, which means that

88
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,980
a lot of the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight

89
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,180
up the chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

90
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,020
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

91
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,900
your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,780
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,940
shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop macbook

94
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
person.

95
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,540
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

96
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,300
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

97
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,660
And it gets even worse.

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,380
You could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate in team building

99
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,780
exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have

100
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,900
a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
your life.

102
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,540
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

103
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,920
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

104
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,740
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

105
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,940
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,020
They'll call you an independent contractor.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,600
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,840
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

109
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,400
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
paid leave, or pension.

111
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,040
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,400
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department.

113
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,040
They already transferred me here.

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Chapter 3.

115
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Advertising.

116
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,080
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

117
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?

118
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,740
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

119
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,240
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals and cigarettes and… sugar snacks,

120
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

121
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

122
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,380
a basic feature of the human condition.

123
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,460
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

124
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
life under capitalism.

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,900
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

126
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,400
up with advertisements for…

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh.

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
So many fans.

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,600
Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
A neoliberal tankie.

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,360
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,080
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

133
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,240
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

134
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,200
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,660
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

136
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,580
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational.

137
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,080
For instance, randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities

138
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,220
the product promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating

139
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,860
the product with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating

140
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,540
the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,

141
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,020
gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely

142
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,060
original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.

143
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,060
Is this rational?

144
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,740
Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?

145
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,780
Of course not.

146
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,900
The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's

147
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,080
to endlessly create new needs.

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,060
And that's a lot to keep up with, and it takes a lot of stamina.

149
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,860
Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.

150
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,780
Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories

151
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,140
for a sustainable blast of power.

152
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,340
With all-natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria

153
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,740
and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.

154
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,620
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple amels, then I take

155
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,380
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.

156
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,700
Vitalimax.

157
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
For bottoms.

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,860
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your

159
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,700
brain through advertising.

160
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,940
Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective

161
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,380
of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.

162
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,020
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

163
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,700
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to

164
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,180
want and then sell it to you.

165
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,980
And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially

166
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,380
egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.

167
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,540
On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,

168
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,060
spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more

169
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,900
than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school

170
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
hungry.

171
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,940
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass-produce $400 juice packet

172
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,020
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are

173
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,540
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.

174
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,540
I mean it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really

175
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,860
worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?

176
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,660
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

177
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,100
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve

178
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,260
humanity rather than the other way around?

179
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,340
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

180
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,380
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden doughnuts we can produce?

181
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
No cuts to Medicaid! Save our labor tax!

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,180
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

183
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,900
Canto 4, Message to the Rich

184
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,860
Alright you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.

185
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,900
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.

186
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,420
I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little

187
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,900
significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,220
are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

189
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,700
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here.

190
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,180
Recent polling data shows that a majority of adults under the age of 30 do not support

191
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,260
capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

192
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,020
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of

193
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,900
the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

194
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,180
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.

195
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,700
You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when

196
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,380
there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.

197
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,740
They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

198
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,020
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix

199
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,900
some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.

200
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,500
I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

201
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,980
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole

202
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,620
thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

203
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,840
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going.

205
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Something is gonna have to change.

206
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,800
And we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.

207
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,480
The choice is up to you.

208
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Well?

209
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Are you going to answer the phone?

210
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
There is no phone.

211
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.

212
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
The heart of a heartless world.

213
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
The soul of a soulless condition.

214
00:12:45,480 --> 00:13:10,280
It's best to just try and ignore it.

215
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,200
Alright kids, so you're angry.

216
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Well, good.

217
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
The world sucks.

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,560
There's a lot to be angry about.

219
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,600
What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.

220
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,440
I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

221
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
So what do we do?

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Smash?

223
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Tabby, get in here!

224
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,000
Sit down.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,800
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.

226
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,480
Harsh words have been exchanged.

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,840
But I need young radicals like you in my life.

228
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,580
The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.

229
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
So I apologize.

230
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,720
I never meant to hurt you.

231
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Baby, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, look, I get it.

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Smashing is fun.

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,480
But we also need to have a real plan, that's all I'm saying.

235
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
So what's the plan?

236
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Revolution.

237
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Okay, yeah.

238
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Revolution.

239
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
I mean, you're right.

240
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,520
Donald Trump is president.

241
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Fuck it.

242
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Revolution.

243
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,080
We've gotta get better people in office.

244
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,000
We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No.

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Revolution.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
Yes, I know revolution, but what kind of revolution?

248
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Like, Project Mayhem, gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the tree of liberty,

249
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
what?

250
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
No, I mean direct action.

251
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,800
Okay, so like a general strike?

252
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
No, end capitalism.

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,800
🎵

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,240
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,

255
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,280
but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive

256
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,760
than just saying the word revolution.

257
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,080
Like I'm in support of radical movements.

258
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,640
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot

259
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,600
of energy, they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural

260
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
impact.

261
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,760
But none of them so far has ended capitalism.

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,760
And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change the state through

263
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,120
electoral politics.

264
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,760
So why not direct some serious energy toward that?

265
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,120
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has ever

266
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,960
even come close to ending capitalism in the US.

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,280
So why do you think that will work?

268
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,320
Well it's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt, finance-backed

269
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,840
system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to.

270
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,800
Well you're not entirely wrong, but on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were

271
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,040
not exactly super great, and in any case I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining

272
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,680
a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

273
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion and getting affordable healthcare and education

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,160
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?

275
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,640
What if the 2020 election is postponed?

276
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Well then I will transition into you and become you unironically.

277
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,280
Why not just be honest about your political stance?

278
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,720
Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a revolution?

279
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Well I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

280
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,120
Now for you, ContraPoints, I mean you're still a heretic and an enemy of the Imperium, and

281
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,160
you are a demonet of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

282
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Well what exactly are your positions?

283
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Um, well...

284
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,800
Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,040
Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?

286
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,000
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,800
Oh because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?

288
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,240
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?

289
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?

290
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,680
Have you read Horkheimer?

291
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,240
Yes.

292
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,520
Have you read Kropotkin?

293
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes.

294
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,200
Have you read Bakunin?

295
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,800
No.

296
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,680
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

297
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,760
Have you read Plakhanov?

298
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,520
Have you read Goldman?

299
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,200
Have you read Zetkin?

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
Have you read Gramsci?

301
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
Have you read Grindelwald?

302
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,120
Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?

303
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

304
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,320
Have you read Slutskanarevsky?

305
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,440
Tabby! I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards,

306
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,920
and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.

307
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,280
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded eastern block gibberish

308
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,120
is a prerequisite for talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

309
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,480
I think I'm just gonna go. This isn't really working out.

310
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,160
Wait, Tabby.

311
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

312
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:32,600
If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind,

313
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,640
oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

314
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Yeah, yeah. I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself.

315
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,240
Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Yeah, yeah. I'll bring you jewelry and money too, but that ain't all I do for you.

317
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,760
Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

318
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:37,560
Yeah, yeah. I know I'll always be your slave until I'm buried, buried in my grave.

319
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,440
Tabby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

320
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,680
Bring it on home, catgirl.

322
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,600
Unsubscribed.

323
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,120
It's fucking 2018, man.
