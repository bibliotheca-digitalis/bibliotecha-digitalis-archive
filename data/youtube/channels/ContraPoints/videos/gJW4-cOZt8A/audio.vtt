00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

00:07.600 --> 00:09.400
yourself questions.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.360
Why is the world bad?

00:11.360 --> 00:13.560
What did all these people die for?

00:13.560 --> 00:16.680
Well, for freedom, I guess.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.680
And like, American values?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.280
But what are those values?

00:21.280 --> 00:24.920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

00:24.920 --> 00:29.960
The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

00:30.120 --> 00:35.600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.560
but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
anyway.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.560
Ugh.

00:41.560 --> 00:48.000
Fuckin' neoliberalism?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.120
What even goes on in these big buildings?

00:50.120 --> 00:53.440
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

00:53.440 --> 00:59.160
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped

00:59.160 --> 01:03.680
cream off the interns?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.280
What the hell even is this country?

01:05.280 --> 01:09.680
It's just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.

01:09.680 --> 01:16.800
Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
Dave & Buster's.

01:17.800 --> 01:25.160
I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.

01:26.160 --> 01:31.720
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's, of course I want the fucking lava

01:31.720 --> 01:32.720
cakes.

01:32.720 --> 01:39.400
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.

01:39.400 --> 01:47.800
Oh goddammit, it was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.480
I feel like capitalism made me do.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.600
Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot

02:02.600 --> 02:04.120
of people have that feeling.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.840
But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.200
The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.440
There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that

02:16.440 --> 02:21.720
sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that

02:21.720 --> 02:25.520
they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.

02:25.520 --> 02:30.680
The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes

02:30.680 --> 02:34.960
from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become

02:34.960 --> 02:39.000
adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist

02:44.000 --> 02:47.360
world of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.

02:47.360 --> 02:54.000
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
homeland.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.760
But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

03:04.760 --> 03:09.960
do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

03:09.960 --> 03:14.280
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.640
So the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.200
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
cucks.

03:24.200 --> 03:29.000
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers, capitalism did.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.880
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and

03:33.880 --> 03:38.960
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
reptiles.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.560
Chapter One, Capitalism and Spirit.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.880
Oh god I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.

03:54.880 --> 03:59.440
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

03:59.440 --> 04:03.160
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.400
A leftist could easily have said that.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.600
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
to it too.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.360
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul

04:14.360 --> 04:19.100
under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates

04:19.100 --> 04:23.120
the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate

04:23.120 --> 04:27.520
objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of lies and

04:27.520 --> 04:32.160
delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast

04:32.160 --> 04:35.320
increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

04:35.320 --> 04:39.160
No I don't want a landline, no one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

04:39.160 --> 04:44.000
Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives

04:44.000 --> 04:49.040
notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meaning in ancient customs,

04:49.040 --> 04:51.360
racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.520
And that shit's not really my scene, I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
person.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.800
But I think that capitalism as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.200
And here's why.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.080
Chapter Two, Alienated Labor.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.960
Ugh this Marxist jargon sucks, let's come up with something new.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.000
Chapter Two, Shitty Jobs.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.080
Why is your job so shitty?

05:13.080 --> 05:17.200
Well probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and

05:17.200 --> 05:20.960
you spend your day dealing with whiny entitled white bitches who don't understand that

05:20.960 --> 05:23.120
you're just a lackey without any actual power.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.840
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

05:26.840 --> 05:27.840
at each other.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.360
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

05:31.360 --> 05:35.060
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

05:35.060 --> 05:36.060
a gear.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.860
The CEO makes 36 million dollars a year, while you make 14 dollars an hour, which means that

05:40.860 --> 05:44.980
a lot of the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight

05:44.980 --> 05:48.180
up the chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

05:48.180 --> 05:52.020
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

05:52.020 --> 05:55.900
your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.780
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

05:59.780 --> 06:05.940
shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop macbook

06:05.940 --> 06:06.940
person.

06:06.940 --> 06:10.540
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

06:10.540 --> 06:15.300
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.660
And it gets even worse.

06:16.660 --> 06:21.380
You could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate in team building

06:21.380 --> 06:26.780
exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have

06:26.780 --> 06:30.900
a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
your life.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.540
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

06:35.540 --> 06:38.920
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.740
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

06:42.740 --> 06:46.940
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

06:46.940 --> 06:52.020
They'll call you an independent contractor.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.600
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.840
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

06:58.840 --> 07:04.400
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

07:04.400 --> 07:05.880
paid leave, or pension.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.040
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.400
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.040
They already transferred me here.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.040
Chapter 3.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.040
Advertising.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.080
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.960
What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?

07:20.960 --> 07:24.740
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

07:24.740 --> 07:31.240
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals and cigarettes and… sugar snacks,

07:31.240 --> 07:33.480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.280
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

07:37.280 --> 07:39.380
a basic feature of the human condition.

07:39.380 --> 07:43.460
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

07:43.460 --> 07:44.460
life under capitalism.

07:44.460 --> 07:48.900
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

07:48.900 --> 07:50.400
up with advertisements for…

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
Oh.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.120
So many fans.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.600
Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
A neoliberal tankie.

07:57.600 --> 08:02.360
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

08:02.360 --> 08:05.080
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

08:05.080 --> 08:09.240
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

08:09.240 --> 08:14.200
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

08:14.200 --> 08:17.660
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

08:17.660 --> 08:21.580
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational.

08:21.580 --> 08:26.080
For instance, randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities

08:26.080 --> 08:30.220
the product promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating

08:30.220 --> 08:34.860
the product with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating

08:34.860 --> 08:39.540
the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,

08:39.540 --> 08:45.020
gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely

08:45.020 --> 08:50.060
original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.

08:50.060 --> 08:51.060
Is this rational?

08:51.060 --> 08:54.740
Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?

08:54.740 --> 08:55.780
Of course not.

08:55.780 --> 08:59.900
The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's

08:59.900 --> 09:02.080
to endlessly create new needs.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.060
And that's a lot to keep up with, and it takes a lot of stamina.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.860
Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.

09:07.860 --> 09:13.780
Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories

09:13.780 --> 09:16.140
for a sustainable blast of power.

09:16.140 --> 09:21.340
With all-natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria

09:21.340 --> 09:25.740
and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.

09:25.740 --> 09:30.620
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple amels, then I take

09:30.620 --> 09:35.380
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.700
Vitalimax.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.300
For bottoms.

09:38.300 --> 09:42.860
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your

09:42.860 --> 09:44.700
brain through advertising.

09:44.700 --> 09:48.940
Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective

09:48.940 --> 09:53.380
of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.

09:53.380 --> 09:58.020
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

09:58.020 --> 10:02.700
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to

10:02.700 --> 10:04.180
want and then sell it to you.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.980
And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially

10:07.980 --> 10:11.380
egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.

10:11.380 --> 10:15.540
On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,

10:15.540 --> 10:20.060
spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more

10:20.060 --> 10:23.900
than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school

10:23.900 --> 10:24.900
hungry.

10:24.900 --> 10:29.940
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass-produce $400 juice packet

10:29.940 --> 10:35.020
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are

10:35.020 --> 10:38.540
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.

10:38.540 --> 10:42.540
I mean it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really

10:42.540 --> 10:46.860
worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?

10:46.860 --> 10:49.660
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:49.660 --> 10:54.100
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve

10:54.100 --> 10:56.260
humanity rather than the other way around?

10:56.260 --> 11:00.340
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

11:00.340 --> 11:05.380
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden doughnuts we can produce?

11:09.500 --> 11:13.500
No cuts to Medicaid! Save our labor tax!

11:13.500 --> 11:15.180
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

11:15.180 --> 11:17.900
Canto 4, Message to the Rich

11:17.900 --> 11:20.860
Alright you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.900
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.420
I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little

11:28.420 --> 11:31.900
significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people

11:31.900 --> 11:36.220
are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.700
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here.

11:38.700 --> 11:43.180
Recent polling data shows that a majority of adults under the age of 30 do not support

11:43.180 --> 11:46.260
capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

11:46.260 --> 11:50.020
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of

11:50.020 --> 11:53.900
the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.180
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.

11:57.180 --> 12:01.700
You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when

12:01.700 --> 12:04.380
there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.740
They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

12:06.740 --> 12:10.020
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix

12:10.020 --> 12:13.900
some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.500
I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

12:17.500 --> 12:21.980
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole

12:21.980 --> 12:26.620
thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.840
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
Something is gonna have to change.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.800
And we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.480
The choice is up to you.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.480
Well?

12:40.480 --> 12:41.480
Are you going to answer the phone?

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
There is no phone.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.480
There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.480
The heart of a heartless world.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.480
The soul of a soulless condition.

12:45.480 --> 13:10.280
It's best to just try and ignore it.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.200
Alright kids, so you're angry.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
Well, good.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.200
The world sucks.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.560
There's a lot to be angry about.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.600
What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.440
I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.440
So what do we do?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.440
Smash?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.440
Tabby, get in here!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.000
Sit down.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.800
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.480
Harsh words have been exchanged.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.840
But I need young radicals like you in my life.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.580
The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.580
So I apologize.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.720
I never meant to hurt you.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.720
Baby, I'm sorry.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.000
I mean, look, I get it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Smashing is fun.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.480
But we also need to have a real plan, that's all I'm saying.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
So what's the plan?

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Revolution.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
Okay, yeah.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
Revolution.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.960
I mean, you're right.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.520
Donald Trump is president.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
Fuck it.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
Revolution.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.080
We've gotta get better people in office.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.000
We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
No.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Revolution.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.560
Yes, I know revolution, but what kind of revolution?

14:08.560 --> 14:13.360
Like, Project Mayhem, gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the tree of liberty,

14:13.360 --> 14:14.360
what?

14:14.360 --> 14:15.360
No, I mean direct action.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.800
Okay, so like a general strike?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.600
No, end capitalism.

14:19.600 --> 14:25.800
🎵

14:25.800 --> 14:29.240
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,

14:29.240 --> 14:32.280
but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive

14:32.280 --> 14:34.760
than just saying the word revolution.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.080
Like I'm in support of radical movements.

14:37.080 --> 14:41.640
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot

14:41.640 --> 14:45.600
of energy, they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
impact.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.760
But none of them so far has ended capitalism.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.760
And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change the state through

14:52.760 --> 14:54.120
electoral politics.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.760
So why not direct some serious energy toward that?

14:56.760 --> 15:01.120
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has ever

15:01.120 --> 15:03.960
even come close to ending capitalism in the US.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.280
So why do you think that will work?

15:06.280 --> 15:10.320
Well it's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt, finance-backed

15:10.320 --> 15:13.840
system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.800
Well you're not entirely wrong, but on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were

15:17.800 --> 15:22.040
not exactly super great, and in any case I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining

15:22.040 --> 15:27.680
a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.000
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion and getting affordable healthcare and education

15:32.000 --> 15:35.160
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.640
What if the 2020 election is postponed?

15:37.640 --> 15:40.800
Well then I will transition into you and become you unironically.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.280
Why not just be honest about your political stance?

15:43.280 --> 15:46.720
Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a revolution?

15:46.720 --> 15:50.480
Well I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

15:50.480 --> 15:55.120
Now for you, ContraPoints, I mean you're still a heretic and an enemy of the Imperium, and

15:55.120 --> 15:58.160
you are a demonet of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.160
Well what exactly are your positions?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.160
Um, well...

16:05.160 --> 16:11.800
Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!

16:11.800 --> 16:16.040
Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?

16:16.040 --> 16:19.000
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.800
Oh because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?

16:23.800 --> 16:29.240
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?

16:29.240 --> 16:33.240
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.680
Have you read Horkheimer?

16:34.680 --> 16:35.240
Yes.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.520
Have you read Kropotkin?

16:36.520 --> 16:37.160
Yes.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.200
Have you read Bakunin?

16:39.240 --> 16:39.800
No.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.680
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.760
Have you read Plakhanov?

16:45.480 --> 16:46.520
Have you read Goldman?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.200
Have you read Zetkin?

16:48.840 --> 16:49.880
Have you read Gramsci?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.040
Have you read Grindelwald?

16:52.040 --> 16:54.120
Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.880
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.320
Have you read Slutskanarevsky?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.440
Tabby! I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards,

17:00.440 --> 17:02.920
and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.280
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded eastern block gibberish

17:06.280 --> 17:10.120
is a prerequisite for talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.480
I think I'm just gonna go. This isn't really working out.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.160
Wait, Tabby.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.760
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

17:18.760 --> 17:32.600
If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind,

17:32.600 --> 17:39.640
oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

17:40.600 --> 17:53.480
Yeah, yeah. I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself.

17:54.280 --> 18:01.240
Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

18:02.200 --> 18:14.680
Yeah, yeah. I'll bring you jewelry and money too, but that ain't all I do for you.

18:15.800 --> 18:22.760
Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

18:23.720 --> 18:37.560
Yeah, yeah. I know I'll always be your slave until I'm buried, buried in my grave.

18:37.560 --> 18:44.440
Tabby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.

18:45.400 --> 18:50.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.680
Bring it on home, catgirl.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.600
Unsubscribed.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.120
It's fucking 2018, man.
