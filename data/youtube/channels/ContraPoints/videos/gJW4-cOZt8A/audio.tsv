0	7600	When you look into the pools of the 9-11 Memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask
7600	9400	yourself questions.
9400	11360	Why is the world bad?
11360	13560	What did all these people die for?
13560	16680	Well, for freedom, I guess.
16680	19680	And like, American values?
19680	21280	But what are those values?
21280	24920	What kind of freedom is it that we have?
24920	29960	The 9-11 Memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.
30120	35600	There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,
35600	39560	but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels
39560	40560	anyway.
40560	41560	Ugh.
41560	48000	Fuckin' neoliberalism?
48000	50120	What even goes on in these big buildings?
50120	53440	I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.
53440	59160	Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped
59160	63680	cream off the interns?
63680	65280	What the hell even is this country?
65280	69680	It's just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.
69680	76800	Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,
76800	77800	Dave & Buster's.
77800	85160	I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.
86160	91720	Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order, Domino's, of course I want the fucking lava
91720	92720	cakes.
92720	99400	I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza, put it all in me, fill me up.
99400	107800	Oh goddammit, it was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.
107920	110480	I feel like capitalism made me do.
118480	122600	Political dissent begins with the vaguest feeling that something is wrong, and a lot
122600	124120	of people have that feeling.
124120	127840	But the problem with vague feelings is they can be channeled in any direction.
127840	132200	The same vague angst can drive people to communism or fascism or anything in between.
132200	136440	There's a general sense today among young people that we have been lied to, and that
136440	141720	sense is perhaps the most acute among middle-class white men, who apparently were promised that
141720	145520	they could be millionaires, or movie gods, or rock stars.
145520	150680	The term special snowflake is used today as a slur against queer teenagers, but it comes
150680	154960	from the movie Fight Club, where it refers to a generation of white guys who have become
154960	159000	adults only to find that they're worse off than their fathers, that they don't have
159000	164000	glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and more recently, that even in the escapist
164000	167360	world of video games, their absolute sovereignty is being challenged.
167360	174000	I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.
174000	180000	Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic
180000	181000	homeland.
181000	184760	But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to
184760	189960	do that because the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing
189960	194280	them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.
194280	198640	So the masculinist, alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.
198640	203200	Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy
203200	204200	cucks.
204200	209000	Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers, capitalism did.
209000	213880	So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people, and
213880	218960	unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn
219280	220280	reptiles.
229280	231560	Chapter One, Capitalism and Spirit.
231560	234880	Oh god I sound like a philosopher, someone shoot me.
234880	239440	Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on
239440	243160	freedom is just another place to go shopping?
243160	245400	A leftist could easily have said that.
245400	249600	We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension
249600	250600	to it too.
250600	254360	Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul
254360	259100	under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates
259100	263120	the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate
263120	267520	objects with transcendent properties beyond their usefulness, with a system of lies and
267520	272160	delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself, with fucking Comcast
272160	275320	increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.
275320	279160	No I don't want a landline, no one under the age of 60 wants a landline.
279160	284000	Of course it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise, fascists and conservatives
284000	289040	notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective meaning in ancient customs,
289040	291360	racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.
291360	295520	And that shit's not really my scene, I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness
295520	296520	person.
296520	301800	But I think that capitalism as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.
301800	303200	And here's why.
303200	305080	Chapter Two, Alienated Labor.
305120	308960	Ugh this Marxist jargon sucks, let's come up with something new.
308960	311000	Chapter Two, Shitty Jobs.
311000	313080	Why is your job so shitty?
313080	317200	Well probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and
317200	320960	you spend your day dealing with whiny entitled white bitches who don't understand that
320960	323120	you're just a lackey without any actual power.
323120	326840	And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout
326840	327840	at each other.
327840	331360	You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really
331360	335060	have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are
335060	336060	a gear.
336060	340860	The CEO makes 36 million dollars a year, while you make 14 dollars an hour, which means that
340860	344980	a lot of the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight
344980	348180	up the chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.
348180	352020	The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against
352020	355900	your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.
355900	359780	And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another
359780	365940	shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop macbook
365940	366940	person.
366940	370540	This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your
370540	375300	shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.
375300	376660	And it gets even worse.
376660	381380	You could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate in team building
381380	386780	exercises, company scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have
386780	390900	a shitty oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating
390900	391900	your life.
391900	395540	You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining
395540	398920	the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.
398920	402740	These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.
402740	406940	If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.
406940	412020	They'll call you an independent contractor.
412020	414600	You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.
414600	418840	You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the
418840	424400	cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,
424400	425880	paid leave, or pension.
425880	429040	So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?
429040	431400	No, please don't transfer me to the billing department.
431400	433040	They already transferred me here.
433040	434040	Chapter 3.
434040	435040	Advertising.
435040	438080	Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?
438080	440960	What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?
440960	444740	If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from
444740	451240	all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals and cigarettes and… sugar snacks,
451240	453480	and now you can't get no satisfaction.
453480	457280	Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like
457280	459380	a basic feature of the human condition.
459380	463460	But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to
463460	464460	life under capitalism.
464460	468900	I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered
468900	470400	up with advertisements for…
470720	471720	Oh.
471720	473120	So many fans.
473120	475600	Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.
475600	477600	A neoliberal tankie.
477600	482360	The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend
482360	485080	nearly $500 billion a year doing.
485080	489240	The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the
489240	494200	fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals
494200	497660	making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.
497660	501580	Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not very rational.
501580	506080	For instance, randomly correlating the product with sexual desire, generating new insecurities
506080	510220	the product promises to alleviate, associating the product with social status, associating
510220	514860	the product with random famous people, associating the product with degenerate decadence, associating
514860	519540	the product with progressive social movements, associating the product with communist revolutions,
519540	525020	gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors, join the clone army, completely
525020	530060	original lighting, gay orgies, love cannot survive without diamonds.
530060	531060	Is this rational?
531060	534740	Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best interests?
534740	535780	Of course not.
535780	539900	The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that people have, it's
539900	542080	to endlessly create new needs.
542080	545060	And that's a lot to keep up with, and it takes a lot of stamina.
545060	547860	Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus.
547860	553780	Every evening before I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories
553780	556140	for a sustainable blast of power.
556140	561340	With all-natural ginseng and opium extracts, Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria
561340	565740	and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.
565740	570620	I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple amels, then I take
570620	575380	my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open.
575380	576700	Vitalimax.
576700	578300	For bottoms.
578300	582860	Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your
582860	584700	brain through advertising.
584700	588940	Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that they invented, irrespective
588940	593380	of whether the fulfillment of the desire actually contributes to your well-being in any way.
593380	598020	So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human
598020	602700	happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to
602700	604180	want and then sell it to you.
604180	607980	And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's especially
607980	611380	egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met.
611380	615540	On the one hand, we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt,
615540	620060	spiraling tuition costs leading college students to take out loans they may never escape, more
620060	623900	than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school
623900	624900	hungry.
624900	629940	And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass-produce $400 juice packet
629940	635020	squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are
635020	638540	willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings.
638540	642540	I mean it's a fine painting, it's got a lot of great red on it, but is it really
642540	646860	worth the cost of feeding every homeless person in America for two weeks?
646860	649660	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
649660	654100	If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve
654100	656260	humanity rather than the other way around?
656260	660340	If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,
660340	665380	and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden doughnuts we can produce?
669500	673500	No cuts to Medicaid! Save our labor tax!
673500	675180	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
675180	677900	Canto 4, Message to the Rich
677900	680860	Alright you filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.
680860	684900	I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics.
684900	688420	I mean, I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little
688420	691900	significance to that as you choose, but what I'm picking up at the moment is that people
691900	696220	are getting fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.
696300	698700	And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here.
698700	703180	Recent polling data shows that a majority of adults under the age of 30 do not support
703180	706260	capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.
706260	710020	This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of
710020	713900	the country is underemployed, in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.
713900	717180	What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well.
717180	721700	You can't just stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when
721700	724380	there are millions of peasants who don't have enough to eat.
724380	726740	They will eventually try to cut your heads off.
726740	730020	And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now, if you don't fix
730020	733900	some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking heads off.
733900	737500	I mean they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to
737500	741980	deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole
741980	746620	thing, bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.
746620	750840	Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.
750840	753840	The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going.
753840	754840	Something is gonna have to change.
754840	757800	And we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.
757800	759480	The choice is up to you.
759480	760480	Well?
760480	761480	Are you going to answer the phone?
761480	762480	There is no phone.
762480	763480	There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.
763480	764480	The heart of a heartless world.
764480	765480	The soul of a soulless condition.
765480	790280	It's best to just try and ignore it.
790280	792200	Alright kids, so you're angry.
792200	793200	Well, good.
793200	794200	The world sucks.
794200	795560	There's a lot to be angry about.
795560	798600	What we have to do next is decide what to do with that anger.
798600	801440	I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.
801440	803440	So what do we do?
803440	804440	Smash?
804440	807440	Tabby, get in here!
807440	809000	Sit down.
809000	811800	Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you.
811800	813480	Harsh words have been exchanged.
813480	815840	But I need young radicals like you in my life.
815840	819580	The minute I stop listening to people like you is the minute I become irrelevant.
819580	820580	So I apologize.
820580	822720	I never meant to hurt you.
822720	823720	Baby, I'm sorry.
823720	826000	I mean, look, I get it.
826000	827000	Smashing is fun.
827000	830480	But we also need to have a real plan, that's all I'm saying.
830480	831480	So what's the plan?
831480	832480	Revolution.
832480	833480	Okay, yeah.
833480	834480	Revolution.
834480	835960	I mean, you're right.
835960	837520	Donald Trump is president.
837520	838520	Fuck it.
838520	839520	Revolution.
839520	841080	We've gotta get better people in office.
841080	844000	We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?
844000	845000	No.
845000	846000	Revolution.
846000	848560	Yes, I know revolution, but what kind of revolution?
848560	853360	Like, Project Mayhem, gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the tree of liberty,
853360	854360	what?
854360	855360	No, I mean direct action.
855360	857800	Okay, so like a general strike?
857800	859600	No, end capitalism.
859600	865800	🎵
865800	869240	Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,
869240	872280	but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more substantive
872280	874760	than just saying the word revolution.
874760	877080	Like I'm in support of radical movements.
877080	881640	Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot
881640	885600	of energy, they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural
885600	886600	impact.
886600	888760	But none of them so far has ended capitalism.
888760	892760	And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change the state through
892760	894120	electoral politics.
894120	896760	So why not direct some serious energy toward that?
896760	901120	Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has ever
901120	903960	even come close to ending capitalism in the US.
903960	906280	So why do you think that will work?
906280	910320	Well it's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt, finance-backed
910320	913840	system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to.
913840	917800	Well you're not entirely wrong, but on the other hand, Chinese and Soviet communism were
917800	922040	not exactly super great, and in any case I'm having a little bit of trouble imagining
922040	927680	a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.
927680	932000	Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion and getting affordable healthcare and education
932000	935160	and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals?
935160	937640	What if the 2020 election is postponed?
937640	940800	Well then I will transition into you and become you unironically.
940800	943280	Why not just be honest about your political stance?
943280	946720	Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a revolution?
946720	950480	Well I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.
950480	955120	Now for you, ContraPoints, I mean you're still a heretic and an enemy of the Imperium, and
955120	958160	you are a demonet of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.
961160	963160	Well what exactly are your positions?
963160	965160	Um, well...
965160	971800	Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!
971800	976040	Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?
976040	979000	Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?
979000	983800	Oh because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?
983800	989240	But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using David Icke's vocabulary?
989240	993240	Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?
993240	994680	Have you read Horkheimer?
994680	995240	Yes.
995240	996520	Have you read Kropotkin?
996520	997160	Yes.
997160	998200	Have you read Bakunin?
999240	999800	No.
999800	1002680	You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.
1003560	1004760	Have you read Plakhanov?
1005480	1006520	Have you read Goldman?
1007160	1008200	Have you read Zetkin?
1008840	1009880	Have you read Gramsci?
1010440	1012040	Have you read Grindelwald?
1012040	1014120	Have you read Slobodan's Arthusian?
1014120	1015880	Have you read Sextus Arcanus?
1015880	1017320	Have you read Slutskanarevsky?
1017320	1020440	Tabby! I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards,
1020440	1022920	and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading any of that shit.
1022920	1026280	And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded eastern block gibberish
1026280	1030120	is a prerequisite for talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.
1030920	1033480	I think I'm just gonna go. This isn't really working out.
1034120	1035160	Wait, Tabby.
1036760	1038760	Before you go, let me say one more thing.
1038760	1052600	If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind,
1052600	1059640	oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.
1060600	1073480	Yeah, yeah. I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself.
1074280	1081240	Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.
1082200	1094680	Yeah, yeah. I'll bring you jewelry and money too, but that ain't all I do for you.
1095800	1102760	Oh, baby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.
1103720	1117560	Yeah, yeah. I know I'll always be your slave until I'm buried, buried in my grave.
1117560	1124440	Tabby, bring it to me. Bring your sweet loving, bring it on home to me.
1125400	1130280	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1133240	1134680	Bring it on home, catgirl.
1135720	1136600	Unsubscribed.
1143880	1146120	It's fucking 2018, man.
