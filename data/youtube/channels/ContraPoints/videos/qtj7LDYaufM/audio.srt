1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
10 hours later...

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,300
10 hours later...

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
10 hours later...

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,600
10 hours later...

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,700
10 hours later...

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,800
1. Hello, darkness.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
Hello, children.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,600
It is I, the darkness, within.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,800
So, you know how life is, like, kinda bad?

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
Well, what are you gonna do about that, hmm?

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,300
I mean, there's a few things you can do.

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,800
First, you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,400
That's probably the most effective approach, eventually.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,500
But the problem is that it's hard.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
And I don't like things that are hard.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
10 hours later...

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Because when you do things that are hard,

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,400
you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
And I don't wanna feel good later.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,900
I wanna feel good now.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
And if you want to feel good now, well, you have a couple options.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,200
The first is, of course, to do drugs.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
And I've tried that.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,700
but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,900
It's not my vibe.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,500
is what any respectable woman would do.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,400
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Is it a pee under my mattress, Your Majesty?

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Now, the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off,

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,500
you feel bad again.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,400
In fact, you probably feel worse.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
So where do we go from here?

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, how about music?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
When you feel bad, you wanna listen to sad music

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,300
because sad music makes you cry.

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,800
And crying feels good.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,500
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness,

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,600
The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel, you know?

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,100
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,400
But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,360
of the song.

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
You only hear,

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,840
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,440
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,480
which is good.

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
Because if you're making songs for sad people,

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,760
it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,880
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,840
When you're sad, happy songs make you feel

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,800
like you're being bullshitted.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
So we're 10 seconds into the song,

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,280
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,060
The key is D-sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,660
But when we get to the next line,

60
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,780
♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,220
Something happens.

62
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,920
Let's listen.

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,220
♪ Come to talk with you again ♪

64
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,900
♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪

65
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,060
Ah!

66
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,460
What was that?

67
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,260
Suddenly a major chord,

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,420
an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,

69
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,740
and every peach fuzz hair on the back

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,200
of my biologically female neck stands on end.

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,720
Hello, light.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
So the song has enticed me

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,480
with its promise of company from misery,

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,040
and then it has tricked me into feeling good.

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,600
And that's what I like about art.

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
It takes the standard disappointments

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
and humiliations of life

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
and cooks them into something

79
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
worth getting off the floor for.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,520
Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,400
because my hands are too beautiful for instruments

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,240
and my singing voice sounds like a man.

83
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,700
So all I really have left

84
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,180
is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to,

85
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,100
comedy.

86
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,780
And I especially like dark comedy.

87
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,060
You know, comedy about the things in life

88
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,460
that are the most painful.

89
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,420
To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.

90
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,180
It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,700
and twists them into a source of pleasure.

92
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,620
And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

93
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,460
Ah!

94
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,100
A lot of the time, that means joking about topics

95
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,500
that in ordinary life are considered taboo.

96
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,800
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

97
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Without the ability to joke

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,760
and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing,

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,240
substance abuse, gender dysphoria,

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
I mean, I'd probably be on the floor right now

101
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,920
looking for that Xanax.

102
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
But this puts me in a difficult situation

103
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
because I want to defend my sense of humor,

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,560
which I feel is like the core of my personality

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
and what keeps me alive.

106
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,160
But at the same time,

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,540
I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture

108
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,940
who are really big on defending provocative,

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,800
controversial, politically incorrect comedy

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,360
are kind of, um, dick nuggets?

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's discuss this.

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
And by discuss, I mean you sit quietly

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,240
and I'll tell you what to think.

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,580
Two, dick nuggets.

115
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,720
So the year 2016 had just begun

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,920
and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

117
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,100
was ranting on Twitter for days and days

119
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,800
about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

120
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,540
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,

121
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,420
a man whose personal branding screams,

122
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,660
I don't care about your feelings.

123
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,220
I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.

124
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,300
I'm too much of a badass rebel

125
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,700
to care what minorities think.

126
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,500
But in January 2016,

127
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,340
Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,

128
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,460
irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.

129
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,500
Why?

130
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,160
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,580
and upset a bunch of people

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,760
by telling jokes about ol' tran-ma Caitlyn Jenner.

133
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,520
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.

134
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,840
I've changed.

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,060
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

136
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

137
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist.

138
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,960
I mean, I do wish he wouldn't

139
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,600
deadname trans people on stage,

140
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,760
but honestly the joke wasn't even as transphobic

141
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,840
as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,520
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,

143
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,380
and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting

144
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,900
about how offending people is good, actually,

145
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,620
and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.

146
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,580
But clearly, Twitter got to him,

147
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,280
because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

148
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,900
with a 13-minute bit rehashing the incident

149
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,140
and doing a series of even more irreverent jokes.

150
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

151
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,340
Well, I am a chimp.

152
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,020
If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.

153
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,700
Pre-op, but...

154
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,020
And don't ever deadname me.

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,680
Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.

156
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,120
From now on, you call me Bobo.

157
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,800
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage

159
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
in a $20 million comedy special?

160
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,600
My issue with this joke is that,

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,300
apart from being extremely passé and overdone,

162
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,340
it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe

163
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,240
that trans women are delusional men.

164
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
And even then, it's just not very funny.

165
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,240
But am I offended by the joke?

166
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed,

167
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
unoriginal, and not very funny.

168
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,160
And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,460
to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,

170
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,860
badly delivered, and not funny enough.

171
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,100
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this

172
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,300
I-identify-as-a-chimp bit is pretty offensive.

173
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,080
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up

174
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,220
because I'm offended.

175
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example

176
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,620
of a cycle it seems like our culture repeats

177
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,900
about once a week.

178
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,340
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,

179
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,400
and other people are indignant about the fact

180
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,880
that those people are offended.

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,980
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle

182
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,520
and a culture war that's supposedly going on

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,920
between generation-snowflake, easily-triggered,

184
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,580
humorless PC cucks, and badass, edgy,

185
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,080
nothing-off-limits free-speech truth-tellers.

186
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,120
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,060
then I am a double agent,

188
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,920
because I'm a generation-snowflake PC cuck

189
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
who loves dank, edgy memes,

190
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,620
and I've found myself on both sides

191
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,320
of this type of conflict many, many times.

192
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,340
So on the one hand, when I see the internet

193
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,020
roasting a comedian for some shitty trans joke,

194
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,060
my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

195
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,020
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels

196
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

197
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,180
And as someone who basically writes jokes

198
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,460
about controversial topics for a living,

199
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,020
I appreciate how difficult it is

200
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,940
to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

201
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,420
while also keeping your moral compass

202
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,380
from getting too jittery.

203
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,520
So what I wanna try to do is step away

204
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,200
from the heat of these social media battles

205
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,960
and try to abstract from them

206
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,720
some more general philosophical questions.

207
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,320
What is the purpose of comedy?

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,640
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

209
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,760
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

210
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

211
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,600
Is it, as Aristotle said,

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,460
the imitation of worse-than-average-men?

213
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,000
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
for whatever reason?

215
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,780
Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.

216
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,880
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective,

217
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,540
but we can probably reach some kind of understanding

218
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,100
by discussing this, right?

219
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,500
And by we, again, I do mean me.

220
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,980
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.

221
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,820
Three, straw men.

222
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,680
So, as a trans woman, up here discussing

223
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,580
why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes are funny,

224
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,660
a lot of haters and losers out there

225
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,820
are probably gonna try to straw man me.

226
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,680
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

227
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,320
Ugh, cis people have like two trans jokes,

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
and they're both so bad.

229
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Here's the straw person's, assholes.

230
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,520
Straw person one, you hate free speech

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,600
and are trying to silence comedians.

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,080
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage,

234
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,920
and I can say whatever I want about them.

235
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Straw person two, you just can't take the heat

236
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,560
when the joke's on you.

237
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,380
I transitioned on YouTube,

238
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,420
making controversial political content all the while,

239
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,700
and I read the comments.

240
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,220
My heat-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

241
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,860
Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing

242
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,940
that has damaged my psyche irreparably,

243
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,780
but sweetie, who doesn't?

244
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,780
Straw person three, you think no one should be allowed

245
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,580
to joke about trans people.

246
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,820
I invented joking about trans people.

247
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,580
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

248
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,580
I'm that tran.

249
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,560
That's right, if I die tomorrow,

250
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,240
my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology

251
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,520
to fellatio, and I accept my destiny.

252
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,480
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

253
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,440
I live for trans jokes.

254
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,280
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,

255
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,320
because they don't know enough about trans people

256
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
to know what the funny things are.

257
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
And being transgender is honestly

258
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,160
the perfect topic for comedy.

259
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Like, you used to live as one gender,

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
and then you became a different gender.

261
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,820
Every single thing about that, it's absolutely hilarious.

262
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,740
But humor is in the details,

263
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,100
and Ricky Gervais does not know the details,

264
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,660
because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,

265
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,940
and that's why he's still telling

266
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,660
these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.

267
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,100
And it's too bad, because I'm actually starving over here

268
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,980
for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark stuff too.

269
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,260
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline

270
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,940
calling her hormones titty skittles.

271
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,740
No, I like the edgy stuff.

272
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,180
I like being on the edge.

273
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.

274
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
that I'd like to share with you,

276
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,840
because when you're doing art criticism,

277
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,600
it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

278
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,820
And the exemplary work I have in mind

279
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,540
is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,

280
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,280
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company

281
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,200
as the works of Dante or Swift.

282
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,640
I am, of course, referring

283
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,840
to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgeous.

284
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
If you don't know who Gigi is,

285
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
first of all, who even are you?

286
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,980
Do you have no respect for legends?

287
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,860
She's a trans YouTuber, like the trans YouTuber,

288
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,220
whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

289
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,140
and I Had Sex with a Dog

290
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,300
long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

291
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,860
But in this critic's opinion,

292
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,260
the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt

293
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,540
the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

294
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,780
Let's do a close reading.

295
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,700
Four, Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience.

296
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,180
A great work of literature is never just a text.

297
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,520
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson

298
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,480
would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.

299
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,300
Love that.

300
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,920
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience

301
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,680
within its proper context.

302
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,960
Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video

303
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,380
about how she and her girlfriend

304
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,160
were trying to have a child, so far without success,

305
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,720
and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

306
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,640
Apparently Gigi was not aware

307
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,160
that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,

308
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
which, girl, they tell you like seven times

309
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
before you start hormones.

310
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,100
Like, how?

311
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,220
We'll move past it.

312
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,820
A few months later, the notification

313
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,500
for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone,

314
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,260
because that's right, I clicked the bell,

315
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,820
and immediately I knew I was about

316
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,620
to experience something special.

317
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,980
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater

318
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,820
than anything I've ever conceived of

319
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,980
that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,

320
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,940
both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

321
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,820
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature.

322
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,260
The eyes are dotted with hearts.

323
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,500
And her facial expression.

324
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
Ew.

325
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,800
Gum.

326
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,760
The video begins with Gigi explaining

327
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,960
that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,

328
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,560
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

329
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
So I hesitantly agreed.

330
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones

331
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,640
so, you know, my shit can get juicy again

332
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,520
and I can get a good little sample up in here.

333
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,920
The sperm bank day arrives, she goes to the clinic,

334
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
and approaches the receptionist.

335
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,680
And I said, yes ma'am, I am here to give sperm

336
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,320
from me to be frozen now.

337
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,700
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,

338
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,220
which she describes with the precision of Mama Flaubert.

339
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,100
I walk into this room, fluorescent lighting, the house.

340
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
I was like, I can see every pore in my arm.

341
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,020
Like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?

342
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,820
And then the kicker, this like leather couch,

343
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,740
the back is kind of like angled,

344
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,220
so I guess like you can lean

345
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,020
and really get into it or something.

346
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,460
The doctor offers her lubrication, pornography if needed,

347
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,740
and a donation cup.

348
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,060
Gigi closes the door and gets to work.

349
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,020
I get in the mood, I get in the zone,

350
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,560
and I'm killing it, bitch.

351
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,520
I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.

352
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
My kid is gonna be a God sent child.

353
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
Before I know it, the moment has crept up on me,

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
it happened, and it's been so long

355
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,880
that it hits the wall behind me.

356
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,120
And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous

357
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,200
gets up off the leather couch and attempts to scrape

358
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,960
a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism

359
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,480
off the wall of a fluorescent lit exam room

360
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,200
in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

361
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,140
And I took the cup and I was like full on

362
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,200
like scraping it off the wall because I was like,

363
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.

364
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,100
You know, I'm here, this is like my moment.

365
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,620
I'm trying to understand why this video

366
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
makes me laugh so much.

367
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,780
It's really the contrast of style and substance.

368
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,140
Like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person

369
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,220
told this story.

370
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,860
It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine

371
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,860
storytelling style in this Real Housewives diction,

372
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,880
but the story itself is about blasting a giant load

373
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,740
onto a wall of a room full of leather and pornography.

374
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,000
The dissonance between form and content is genius.

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,680
And that dissonance perfectly captures the absurdity

376
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,520
of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness

377
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,980
that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.

378
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,440
I also really relate to this story

379
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
because right before I started hormones,

380
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,720
I decided to freeze a sample of my own

381
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,760
so I too have a sperm bank experience.

382
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,920
And it was exactly like Gigi describes,

383
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,320
down to every detail.

384
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,360
It is not a dignified moment, ladies.

385
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,380
There is just no way to feel like a woman

386
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,340
while you're hastily rubbing one out

387
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,240
in an overlit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

388
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,940
I feel so fish right now.

389
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,720
For this five minutes in the exam room, I was a man.

390
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,780
Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample

391
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,520
into the cup, but there's a different

392
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
absurd detail to my story.

393
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,820
The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork

394
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,120
that I was depositing because I was going

395
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,600
to start feminizing hormones, and he asked me

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,640
if there was a name I preferred he called me.

397
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,840
In retrospect, he was actually really sweet

398
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,680
and really cute.

399
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,300
Not that anything was gonna come of that at the time

400
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,640
since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.

401
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
Be honest, I was all edges.

402
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
But he asked me for my preferred name

403
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,200
and I just blurted out Natalie.

404
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,360
And so this was actually the first time

405
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,820
anyone ever called me by my biological name.

406
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,860
And it went like this.

407
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,280
The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me

408
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,440
and said, right this way, Natalie.

409
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,800
Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.

410
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,520
And that's how my life as a woman began.

411
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Now in the end, Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

412
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,300
Her sample wasn't usable.

413
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,220
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,

414
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,040
but she's been on hormones too long and she just can't.

415
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,780
And that revelation at the end of the video

416
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,540
kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.

417
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,180
In this ridiculous image of Gigi

418
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,060
scraping ejaculate off the wall,

419
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,460
I now see this primal maternal urge

420
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,300
to produce and protect children.

421
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,660
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen

422
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,380
prematurely from the nest.

423
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,100
I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.

424
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,480
I really, really thought that I was gonna have

425
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,200
a good sample and I was gonna be able

426
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,660
to participate in having a baby with my DNA,

427
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,540
but it's just not in the cards for me.

428
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,980
And I really wanted to make this video

429
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,980
more positive and funny because there is nothing I can do.

430
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,820
And that's exactly it.

431
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,300
That is the darkness.

432
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,520
Five, the darkness.

433
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,080
The darkness is my name for what I consider

434
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,940
the highest form of comedy,

435
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,620
where you take your own worst feelings,

436
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,940
traumas, and anxieties,

437
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,620
and twist them into a source of pleasure.

438
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,460
The darkness is Richard Pryor

439
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,900
running down the street in flames

440
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,880
because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.

441
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,640
The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous

442
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,480
scraping her own prodigious jism

443
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,780
off the wall of an exam room

444
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,280
in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

445
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,480
If you can make these low points funny,

446
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,000
then you're gonna be okay.

447
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
You're gonna survive.

448
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,640
You're gonna make it through life.

449
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,680
And I need that now more than ever

450
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,320
because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty dark.

451
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,600
But trans people make it through

452
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,640
because we're good-humored and strong as fuck.

453
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,560
Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones

454
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,100
before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.

455
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,060
What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?

456
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,700
Am I gonna become a man again?

457
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,140
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

458
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,560
I am thinking about names, though,

459
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,900
like maybe Nathan or Jaden.

460
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,580
I can see myself as a Jaden.

461
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes

462
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,220
or I don't think I can make it through this.

463
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,620
Like, when I have bottom surgery,

464
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,460
I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it

465
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,340
as my sex-change operation

466
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,260
because it makes me laugh, it brings me joy.

467
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,900
Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.

468
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,360
Now, it's important to notice

469
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
that just because it doesn't make me laugh

470
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,960
doesn't mean it's a politically correct euphemism.

471
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,720
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change

472
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,000
because you're literally not changing your sex.

473
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,680
That's not what surgery does.

474
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,200
But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness

475
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,040
where they mistake edginess

476
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,520
for honesty, accuracy, and directness,

477
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,400
but these are very different things.

478
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
For example, George Carlin has a classic bit

479
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
about euphemisms that has some great moments,

480
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,180
but also some moments that are way off base.

481
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,140
For example, content-wording ableist slur.

482
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,780
They say they're going to pre-board

483
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,500
those passengers in need of special assistance.

484
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Cripples!

485
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,420
Simple, honest, direct language.

486
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,900
So look, I understand the aesthetic preference

487
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,980
for simple, honest, direct language

488
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,900
and the repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.

489
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,420
That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

490
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,840
But the word he just used is literally a slur,

491
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,820
so I wonder if what you're being honest about

492
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,980
is your feelings toward disabled people.

493
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,780
Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance

494
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,420
is a little wordy, sure, but in this situation,

495
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,820
it's actually more accurate

496
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,140
since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,

497
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,980
anyone in need of assistance boarding.

498
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,020
So I call my gender confirmation surgery

499
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,420
getting a sex change,

500
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,380
not because it's more direct and honest,

501
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,620
but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated,

502
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,260
and that makes me laugh.

503
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,080
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller,

504
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,900
but because I'm a bad person.

505
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,840
And I get to call it my sex change operation,

506
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,960
but cis people don't get to call it that,

507
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,080
because it's my darkness, not yours.

508
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,200
Get your own darkness.

509
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,040
When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people,

510
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,200
he's being a hack,

511
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
because he knows nothing of our darkness.

512
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,040
And when someone tries to joke about something

513
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,680
that they're totally ignorant of,

514
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,000
the result is usually clumsy, awkward, and not very funny.

515
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,160
What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais

516
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,200
took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness

517
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
and turned it within.

518
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,460
Because within is where the darkness lies.

519
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,180
Six, self-deprecation.

520
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,580
Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite,

521
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,300
because as a lazy, selfish, preening attention whore

522
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,580
who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter

523
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,420
with the voice of a tropical bird,

524
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,500
there's a lot of material here to work with.

525
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,900
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,

526
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,540
there is a faction of the trans community

527
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,860
that is not amused by the buffoonery

528
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,420
that goes on on this channel.

529
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,660
I think the objection to it is best summed up

530
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,360
by the comic Hannah Gatsby,

531
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,880
who in her stand-up special Nanette said

532
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
that when self-deprecation comes from someone

533
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,080
who exists in the margins.

534
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,800
It's not humility, it's humiliation.

535
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,720
And to be honest, I felt a little called out by that.

536
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,860
I put myself down in order to speak,

537
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,800
in order to seek permission to speak.

538
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,440
And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.

539
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,020
In order to gain an audience as a trans person,

540
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,760
you have to demonstrate what cis people call self-awareness.

541
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
That is, you have to signal that you see yourself

542
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,000
the way the audience sees you,

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,680
which can mean looking at yourself

544
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,720
with a pretty merciless gaze.

545
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,120
And of course I'm happy to do that,

546
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,880
because I have no self-respect

547
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,360
and laughter is the only way to numb the pain.

548
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,600
But the terrible thing about being a not normal

549
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,020
with an audience is that you don't just get to be yourself,

550
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,800
because whether you like it or not,

551
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,920
people will see you as a representative of the community,

552
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,980
so because of that responsibility,

553
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,380
which I never asked for,

554
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,820
I have to balance out the self-deprecation

555
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,900
with a lot of positive messaging about my people.

556
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,420
And that way, the dark chokes function

557
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,740
as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis go down.

558
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,420
But even without the group representation issue,

559
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,340
it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation too far.

560
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,620
As I've said, I have been diagnosed

561
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,220
with an incurable edginess of temperament,

562
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,160
and I sometimes do feel suffocated

563
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,160
by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces,

564
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,120
even though those spaces are there for good reason

565
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,360
and a lot of people need them.

566
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,840
But sometimes this atmosphere of everything

567
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,960
and everyone is valid all the time,

568
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,720
no uncomfortable questions may be asked,

569
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,520
any self-deprecation is a sign

570
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
of traumatic internalized bigotry,

571
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
I just need to get out of there for a while

572
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,320
and find a place where I can relax and be my edgy self.

573
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,920
I need a safe space for my edginess,

574
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,100
where I can just blurt out

575
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,820
whatever stupid question or joke comes to mind

576
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,620
without being afraid that I'm gonna inflict

577
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,720
horrible trauma on everyone around me.

578
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,820
So I call up another transsexual edge lady,

579
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,740
you know, kiki, accuse each other of being crossdressers,

580
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,660
and just laugh it all off.

581
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,140
And it's so, so cathartic to do that,

582
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,060
but it does have to be done in moderation,

583
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,420
because there can come a point

584
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,060
where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.

585
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,340
And it mostly has to be done in private,

586
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,460
because in public, you have to worry

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,960
about how cis people will interpret it,

588
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,680
and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating

589
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,480
without abandoning all social responsibility.

590
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase

591
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
that instantly deadens all laughter,

592
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,960
it's social responsibility.

593
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,840
But since it's kind of the central topic

594
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,400
of the comedy culture war,

595
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,480
I should probably say something about it,

596
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,260
even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back

597
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,520
to jabbering about my sex change.

598
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,100
Seven, the eternal tension.

599
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,040
So what is a comedian's job?

600
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,780
What is a comedian supposed to do?

601
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,020
I suppose my ideal comedian is one

602
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,640
who is perfectly able to balance the tension

603
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,380
between shitposting and snowflakery.

604
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
And this is an eternal tension,

605
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,300
and must never be resolved.

606
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,700
It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.

607
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,860
See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery,

608
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,620
you get a moralist who might say

609
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,280
that a comedian's purpose is to promote justice

610
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,020
by punching up, by speaking truth to power,

611
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,160
by exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.

612
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,240
And these are all very admirable goals,

613
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
but they leave out what I think

614
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
is the essential purpose of comedy,

615
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,380
which is to be funny, to surprise,

616
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,280
to shock, to make people laugh.

617
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,580
It's kind of like how some art and media critics

618
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,920
only ever evaluate a work based on whether or not

619
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,320
it's socially progressive,

620
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,720
and don't seem to really think

621
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,740
about aesthetic pleasure very much,

622
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,420
which, to me, is the reason why art exists

623
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,400
in the first place.

624
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,800
But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent,

625
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,380
and should probably be sent to the guillotine at once.

626
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,540
Just let me do my makeup first,

627
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,660
so that when they hold my head up,

628
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,740
everyone can see my beat,

629
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,300
and their wings all fly to the Bastille.

630
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,820
Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram,

631
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,940
cause that's gonna get a lot of engagement.

632
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,780
So the opposite of the pure snowflake

633
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,300
is the pure shit poster,

634
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,940
who might say that a comedian's purpose

635
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,600
is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.

636
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,300
But that seems kind of barbaric,

637
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,780
since like, if a guard at a prison camp

638
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,700
is torturing an inmate and the other guards are laughing,

639
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,220
does that count as comedy?

640
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,600
Is a war crime funny?

641
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.

642
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,840
The thing is, I don't think many comedians

643
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
actually believe in a completely

644
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,320
nihilistic vision of comedy.

645
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,040
I think they sometimes pretend to

646
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,720
when they're trying to evade criticism.

647
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,640
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,

648
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,800
and listen to the way they talk about their heroes,

649
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

650
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
There's always an element of admiration

651
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,760
for bravery, risk, subversion, truth-telling.

652
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,240
In other words, there's a concern there

653
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,460
for what is virtuous and what is true,

654
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,580
not just for what makes people laugh.

655
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,500
So maybe before we can even talk about what's funny,

656
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,380
we have to have a level of shared agreement

657
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,580
about what is true and what is morally right.

658
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,200
My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes

659
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,140
is not just that they're not funny.

660
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,500
I think he's wrong about trans people,

661
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,780
and I think his ignorance is infectious.

662
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,260
I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience,

663
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,340
which has the consequence of making the world

664
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,300
slightly scarier for people like me.

665
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,040
And this is edginess at its worst,

666
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,200
just a privileged person with a platform

667
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
punching down at a politically besieged group

668
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
he understands nothing about.

669
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,800
And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension

670
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,740
collapses into pure shitposting.

671
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,320
It's boring and immature, like when someone says

672
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,040
he wants to watch the world burn.

673
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,540
You only get to watch when you have the privilege

674
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,080
of not being on fire.

675
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,880
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

676
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,500
The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.

677
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Edginess is always adolescent.

678
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,940
The darkness is edginess aged by time and pain.

679
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
And it's only at that full maturity

680
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,700
that comedy becomes art,

681
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,140
that it becomes comparable to music.

682
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,460
So, those are my thoughts.

683
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,380
Like, comment, and subscribe.

684
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,140
The end.

685
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,420
Fine, I'll sing the song.

686
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
