33300	36300	10 hours later...
36300	38600	10 hours later...
38600	39700	10 hours later...
39700	42800	1. Hello, darkness.
42800	44200	Hello, children.
44200	47600	It is I, the darkness, within.
47600	51800	So, you know how life is, like, kinda bad?
51800	53700	Well, what are you gonna do about that, hmm?
53700	55300	I mean, there's a few things you can do.
55300	59800	First, you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.
59800	63400	That's probably the most effective approach, eventually.
63400	65500	But the problem is that it's hard.
65500	67400	And I don't like things that are hard.
67400	69800	10 hours later...
69800	71600	Because when you do things that are hard,
71600	75400	you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.
75400	77300	And I don't wanna feel good later.
77300	78900	I wanna feel good now.
78900	82500	And if you want to feel good now, well, you have a couple options.
82500	85200	The first is, of course, to do drugs.
85200	86400	And I've tried that.
86400	89600	I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,
89600	91700	but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.
91700	92900	It's not my vibe.
92900	95900	So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming
95900	98500	is what any respectable woman would do.
98500	102400	I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.
102400	105200	Is it a pee under my mattress, Your Majesty?
105200	108200	Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?
108200	111400	Now, the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off,
111400	112500	you feel bad again.
112500	115400	In fact, you probably feel worse.
115400	117200	So where do we go from here?
117300	120000	Well, how about music?
120000	122600	When you feel bad, you wanna listen to sad music
122600	125300	because sad music makes you cry.
125300	127800	And crying feels good.
127800	130500	It's like an orgasm for sad people.
130500	134100	And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness,
134100	137600	The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel, you know?
137600	141600	I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.
141600	145100	♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪
145100	147400	But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds
147400	148360	of the song.
148360	149200	You only hear,
149200	150840	♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪
150840	153440	And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,
153440	154480	which is good.
154480	156800	Because if you're making songs for sad people,
156800	160760	it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.
160760	163880	Because sad people don't like happy songs.
163880	166840	When you're sad, happy songs make you feel
166840	168800	like you're being bullshitted.
168800	170480	So we're 10 seconds into the song,
170480	172280	♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪
172280	176060	The key is D-sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.
176060	177660	But when we get to the next line,
177660	179780	♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪
179780	181220	Something happens.
181220	182920	Let's listen.
182920	187220	♪ Come to talk with you again ♪
187220	190900	♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪
190900	192060	Ah!
192060	193460	What was that?
193460	195260	Suddenly a major chord,
195260	198420	an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,
198420	200740	and every peach fuzz hair on the back
200760	204200	of my biologically female neck stands on end.
204200	205720	Hello, light.
205720	207280	So the song has enticed me
207280	209480	with its promise of company from misery,
209480	213040	and then it has tricked me into feeling good.
213040	214600	And that's what I like about art.
214600	216400	It takes the standard disappointments
216400	217840	and humiliations of life
217840	219440	and cooks them into something
219440	221080	worth getting off the floor for.
221080	223520	Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore
223520	226400	because my hands are too beautiful for instruments
226400	228240	and my singing voice sounds like a man.
228260	229700	So all I really have left
229700	233180	is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to,
233180	234100	comedy.
234100	236780	And I especially like dark comedy.
236780	239060	You know, comedy about the things in life
239060	240460	that are the most painful.
240460	243420	To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.
243420	246180	It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties
246180	248700	and twists them into a source of pleasure.
248700	251620	And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?
251620	252460	Ah!
252460	255100	A lot of the time, that means joking about topics
255100	257500	that in ordinary life are considered taboo.
257520	261800	You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
261800	263120	Without the ability to joke
263120	265760	and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing,
265760	268240	substance abuse, gender dysphoria,
268240	270320	I mean, I'd probably be on the floor right now
270320	271920	looking for that Xanax.
271920	274200	But this puts me in a difficult situation
274200	276040	because I want to defend my sense of humor,
276040	278560	which I feel is like the core of my personality
278560	279880	and what keeps me alive.
279880	281160	But at the same time,
281160	283540	I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture
283540	285940	who are really big on defending provocative,
285960	288800	controversial, politically incorrect comedy
288800	292360	are kind of, um, dick nuggets?
292360	293600	Let's discuss this.
293600	295840	And by discuss, I mean you sit quietly
295840	298240	and I'll tell you what to think.
298240	300580	Two, dick nuggets.
300580	302720	So the year 2016 had just begun
302720	305920	and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.
305920	309920	Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,
309920	312100	was ranting on Twitter for days and days
312100	315800	about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.
316660	317540	This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,
317540	319420	a man whose personal branding screams,
319420	321660	I don't care about your feelings.
321660	325220	I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.
325220	327300	I'm too much of a badass rebel
327300	329700	to care what minorities think.
329700	331500	But in January 2016,
331500	334340	Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,
334340	338460	irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.
338460	339500	Why?
339500	342160	Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes
342160	343580	and upset a bunch of people
343600	346760	by telling jokes about ol' tran-ma Caitlyn Jenner.
346760	348520	But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.
348520	349840	I've changed.
350800	354060	Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.
354060	355980	That's cutting edge material there, Rick.
355980	360980	Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist.
360980	361960	I mean, I do wish he wouldn't
361960	363600	deadname trans people on stage,
363600	366760	but honestly the joke wasn't even as transphobic
366760	369840	as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.
369840	373520	Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,
374360	375380	and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting
375380	377900	about how offending people is good, actually,
377900	380620	and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.
380620	382580	But clearly, Twitter got to him,
382580	385280	because two years later, he opened his Netflix special
385280	387900	with a 13-minute bit rehashing the incident
387900	392140	and doing a series of even more irreverent jokes.
392140	395140	Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?
395140	396340	Well, I am a chimp.
396340	398020	If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.
398020	399700	Pre-op, but...
401420	403020	And don't ever deadname me.
403040	404680	Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.
404680	407120	From now on, you call me Bobo.
407120	409800	Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?
409800	413040	Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage
413040	415040	in a $20 million comedy special?
415040	416600	My issue with this joke is that,
416600	419300	apart from being extremely passé and overdone,
419300	422340	it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe
422340	424240	that trans women are delusional men.
424240	426960	And even then, it's just not very funny.
426960	429240	But am I offended by the joke?
429240	431920	Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed,
431940	433940	unoriginal, and not very funny.
433940	437160	And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,
437160	440460	to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,
440460	442860	badly delivered, and not funny enough.
442860	445100	So by that measure, yes, I'd say this
445100	448300	I-identify-as-a-chimp bit is pretty offensive.
448300	450080	But I'm not bringing this old controversy up
450080	451220	because I'm offended.
451220	454180	I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example
454180	456620	of a cycle it seems like our culture repeats
456620	457900	about once a week.
457900	461340	Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,
461340	463400	and other people are indignant about the fact
463400	464880	that those people are offended.
464880	466980	The cycle usually gets framed as a battle
466980	469520	and a culture war that's supposedly going on
469520	471920	between generation-snowflake, easily-triggered,
471920	474580	humorless PC cucks, and badass, edgy,
474580	477080	nothing-off-limits free-speech truth-tellers.
477080	480120	Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,
480120	482060	then I am a double agent,
482060	484920	because I'm a generation-snowflake PC cuck
484920	486760	who loves dank, edgy memes,
486760	488620	and I've found myself on both sides
488620	491320	of this type of conflict many, many times.
492300	493340	So on the one hand, when I see the internet
493340	496020	roasting a comedian for some shitty trans joke,
496020	499060	my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.
499060	502020	But my inner edge lady knows how it feels
502020	504140	to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.
504140	506180	And as someone who basically writes jokes
506180	508460	about controversial topics for a living,
508460	511020	I appreciate how difficult it is
511020	515940	to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy
515940	518420	while also keeping your moral compass
518420	520380	from getting too jittery.
520380	522520	So what I wanna try to do is step away
522520	525200	from the heat of these social media battles
525200	526960	and try to abstract from them
526960	529720	some more general philosophical questions.
529720	531320	What is the purpose of comedy?
531320	533640	What is it that makes comedy good or bad?
533640	536760	Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?
536760	539720	Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?
539720	541600	Is it, as Aristotle said,
541600	544460	the imitation of worse-than-average-men?
544460	547000	Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at
547000	548600	for whatever reason?
548620	550780	Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.
550780	552880	I mean, comedy's pretty subjective,
552880	555540	but we can probably reach some kind of understanding
555540	557100	by discussing this, right?
557100	560500	And by we, again, I do mean me.
560500	562980	The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.
562980	564820	Three, straw men.
564820	567680	So, as a trans woman, up here discussing
567680	570580	why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes are funny,
570580	572660	a lot of haters and losers out there
572660	574820	are probably gonna try to straw man me.
574820	579680	Did you just assume the straw person's gender?
579680	582320	Ugh, cis people have like two trans jokes,
582320	584160	and they're both so bad.
584160	586960	Here's the straw person's, assholes.
586960	589520	Straw person one, you hate free speech
589520	591600	and are trying to silence comedians.
591600	594120	I'm not trying to silence anyone.
594120	597080	Comedians can say whatever they want on stage,
597080	599920	and I can say whatever I want about them.
599920	602920	Straw person two, you just can't take the heat
602920	604560	when the joke's on you.
605300	606380	I transitioned on YouTube,
606380	609420	making controversial political content all the while,
609420	611700	and I read the comments.
611700	616220	My heat-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.
616220	618860	Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing
618860	620940	that has damaged my psyche irreparably,
620940	622780	but sweetie, who doesn't?
622780	625780	Straw person three, you think no one should be allowed
625780	627580	to joke about trans people.
627580	630820	I invented joking about trans people.
630820	632580	Ever heard of the mouth feel?
632580	633580	I'm that tran.
633600	635560	That's right, if I die tomorrow,
635560	639240	my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology
639240	642520	to fellatio, and I accept my destiny.
642520	645480	Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.
645480	647440	I live for trans jokes.
647440	650280	I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,
650280	652320	because they don't know enough about trans people
652320	654080	to know what the funny things are.
654080	655600	And being transgender is honestly
655600	657160	the perfect topic for comedy.
657160	659200	Like, you used to live as one gender,
659200	661360	and then you became a different gender.
661380	664820	Every single thing about that, it's absolutely hilarious.
664820	666740	But humor is in the details,
666740	669100	and Ricky Gervais does not know the details,
669100	671660	because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,
671660	672940	and that's why he's still telling
672940	675660	these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.
675660	678100	And it's too bad, because I'm actually starving over here
678100	680980	for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark stuff too.
680980	683260	I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline
683260	684940	calling her hormones titty skittles.
684940	686740	No, I like the edgy stuff.
686740	688180	I like being on the edge.
688200	692800	Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.
692800	695200	Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy
695200	696560	that I'd like to share with you,
696560	698840	because when you're doing art criticism,
698840	701600	it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.
701600	703820	And the exemplary work I have in mind
703820	706540	is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,
706540	709280	but which I have no qualms placing in the same company
709280	711200	as the works of Dante or Swift.
711200	712640	I am, of course, referring
712640	715840	to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgeous.
715840	717120	If you don't know who Gigi is,
717140	718420	first of all, who even are you?
718420	719980	Do you have no respect for legends?
719980	722860	She's a trans YouTuber, like the trans YouTuber,
722860	725220	whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids
725220	727140	and I Had Sex with a Dog
727140	730300	long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.
730300	731860	But in this critic's opinion,
731860	735260	the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt
735260	738540	the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.
738540	739780	Let's do a close reading.
739780	742700	Four, Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience.
742700	746180	A great work of literature is never just a text.
746200	749520	It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson
749520	753480	would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.
753480	754300	Love that.
754300	756920	Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience
756920	758680	within its proper context.
758680	760960	Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video
760960	762380	about how she and her girlfriend
762380	765160	were trying to have a child, so far without success,
765160	767720	and so they went to see a fertility specialist.
767720	769640	Apparently Gigi was not aware
769640	772160	that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,
772160	774880	which, girl, they tell you like seven times
774900	775900	before you start hormones.
775900	777100	Like, how?
777100	778220	We'll move past it.
778220	779820	A few months later, the notification
779820	782500	for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone,
782500	784260	because that's right, I clicked the bell,
784260	785820	and immediately I knew I was about
785820	787620	to experience something special.
787620	789980	The thumbnail for this video is so much greater
789980	791820	than anything I've ever conceived of
791820	793980	that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,
793980	795940	both as a YouTuber and as a woman.
795940	798820	The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature.
798820	801260	The eyes are dotted with hearts.
801260	803500	And her facial expression.
803560	804880	Ew.
804880	805800	Gum.
805800	807760	The video begins with Gigi explaining
807760	809960	that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,
809960	812560	she had to stop taking hormones for three months.
812560	814160	So I hesitantly agreed.
814160	816240	I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones
816240	818640	so, you know, my shit can get juicy again
818640	820520	and I can get a good little sample up in here.
820520	822920	The sperm bank day arrives, she goes to the clinic,
822920	824680	and approaches the receptionist.
824680	828680	And I said, yes ma'am, I am here to give sperm
828680	832320	from me to be frozen now.
832340	834700	The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,
834700	838220	which she describes with the precision of Mama Flaubert.
838220	841100	I walk into this room, fluorescent lighting, the house.
841100	843100	I was like, I can see every pore in my arm.
843100	845020	Like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?
845020	847820	And then the kicker, this like leather couch,
847820	849740	the back is kind of like angled,
849740	851220	so I guess like you can lean
851220	853020	and really get into it or something.
853020	856460	The doctor offers her lubrication, pornography if needed,
856460	857740	and a donation cup.
857740	860060	Gigi closes the door and gets to work.
860060	862020	I get in the mood, I get in the zone,
862720	863560	and I'm killing it, bitch.
863560	865520	I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.
865520	867720	My kid is gonna be a God sent child.
867720	870000	Before I know it, the moment has crept up on me,
870000	872480	it happened, and it's been so long
872480	874880	that it hits the wall behind me.
874880	878120	And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous
878120	881200	gets up off the leather couch and attempts to scrape
881200	883960	a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism
883960	886480	off the wall of a fluorescent lit exam room
886480	889200	in a desperate final bid to become a mother.
889200	891140	And I took the cup and I was like full on
891140	893200	like scraping it off the wall because I was like,
893200	895180	I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.
895180	897100	You know, I'm here, this is like my moment.
897100	898620	I'm trying to understand why this video
898620	900380	makes me laugh so much.
900380	902780	It's really the contrast of style and substance.
902780	905140	Like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person
905140	906220	told this story.
906220	908860	It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine
908860	911860	storytelling style in this Real Housewives diction,
911860	915880	but the story itself is about blasting a giant load
915880	918740	onto a wall of a room full of leather and pornography.
919240	922000	The dissonance between form and content is genius.
922000	924680	And that dissonance perfectly captures the absurdity
924680	927520	of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness
927520	929980	that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.
929980	931440	I also really relate to this story
931440	933360	because right before I started hormones,
933360	935720	I decided to freeze a sample of my own
935720	938760	so I too have a sperm bank experience.
938760	940920	And it was exactly like Gigi describes,
940920	942320	down to every detail.
942320	944360	It is not a dignified moment, ladies.
944360	946380	There is just no way to feel like a woman
946380	948340	while you're hastily rubbing one out
948900	951240	in an overlit room designed for men to ejaculate in.
951240	952940	I feel so fish right now.
954100	956720	For this five minutes in the exam room, I was a man.
956720	958780	Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample
958780	960520	into the cup, but there's a different
960520	962080	absurd detail to my story.
962080	964820	The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork
964820	967120	that I was depositing because I was going
967120	969600	to start feminizing hormones, and he asked me
969600	971640	if there was a name I preferred he called me.
971640	973840	In retrospect, he was actually really sweet
973840	974680	and really cute.
974680	976300	Not that anything was gonna come of that at the time
976300	979640	since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.
979640	980880	Be honest, I was all edges.
980880	982320	But he asked me for my preferred name
982320	984200	and I just blurted out Natalie.
984200	986360	And so this was actually the first time
986360	988820	anyone ever called me by my biological name.
988820	989860	And it went like this.
989860	992280	The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me
992280	994440	and said, right this way, Natalie.
994440	996800	Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.
996800	999520	And that's how my life as a woman began.
999520	1004520	Now in the end, Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.
1004660	1006300	Her sample wasn't usable.
1006300	1008220	She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,
1008220	1011040	but she's been on hormones too long and she just can't.
1011040	1012780	And that revelation at the end of the video
1012780	1015540	kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.
1015540	1017180	In this ridiculous image of Gigi
1017180	1019060	scraping ejaculate off the wall,
1019060	1021460	I now see this primal maternal urge
1021460	1023300	to produce and protect children.
1023300	1025660	I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen
1025660	1027380	prematurely from the nest.
1027380	1030100	I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.
1030100	1032480	I really, really thought that I was gonna have
1032480	1034200	a good sample and I was gonna be able
1034880	1036660	to participate in having a baby with my DNA,
1036660	1038540	but it's just not in the cards for me.
1038540	1039980	And I really wanted to make this video
1039980	1042980	more positive and funny because there is nothing I can do.
1042980	1044820	And that's exactly it.
1044820	1047300	That is the darkness.
1047300	1049520	Five, the darkness.
1049520	1052080	The darkness is my name for what I consider
1052080	1053940	the highest form of comedy,
1053940	1055620	where you take your own worst feelings,
1055620	1056940	traumas, and anxieties,
1056940	1059620	and twist them into a source of pleasure.
1059620	1061460	The darkness is Richard Pryor
1061460	1062900	running down the street in flames
1062900	1065880	because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.
1065880	1067640	The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous
1067640	1069480	scraping her own prodigious jism
1069480	1070780	off the wall of an exam room
1070780	1073280	in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.
1073280	1075480	If you can make these low points funny,
1075480	1077000	then you're gonna be okay.
1077000	1078120	You're gonna survive.
1078120	1079640	You're gonna make it through life.
1079640	1081680	And I need that now more than ever
1081680	1085320	because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty dark.
1085320	1086600	But trans people make it through
1086600	1089640	because we're good-humored and strong as fuck.
1089640	1091560	Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones
1091580	1094100	before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.
1094100	1096060	What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?
1096060	1097700	Am I gonna become a man again?
1097700	1099140	Because I don't know if I can handle that.
1099140	1100560	I am thinking about names, though,
1100560	1102900	like maybe Nathan or Jaden.
1102900	1104580	I can see myself as a Jaden.
1104580	1106580	See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes
1106580	1108220	or I don't think I can make it through this.
1108220	1109620	Like, when I have bottom surgery,
1109620	1112460	I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it
1112460	1115340	as my sex-change operation
1115340	1117260	because it makes me laugh, it brings me joy.
1117260	1120900	Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.
1120920	1122360	Now, it's important to notice
1122360	1124280	that just because it doesn't make me laugh
1124280	1126960	doesn't mean it's a politically correct euphemism.
1126960	1130720	Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change
1130720	1133000	because you're literally not changing your sex.
1133000	1134680	That's not what surgery does.
1134680	1138200	But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness
1138200	1140040	where they mistake edginess
1140040	1142520	for honesty, accuracy, and directness,
1142520	1144400	but these are very different things.
1144400	1146720	For example, George Carlin has a classic bit
1146720	1149440	about euphemisms that has some great moments,
1149460	1152180	but also some moments that are way off base.
1152180	1155140	For example, content-wording ableist slur.
1155140	1156780	They say they're going to pre-board
1156780	1160500	those passengers in need of special assistance.
1160500	1161700	Cripples!
1162820	1165420	Simple, honest, direct language.
1165420	1167900	So look, I understand the aesthetic preference
1167900	1169980	for simple, honest, direct language
1169980	1172900	and the repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.
1172900	1175420	That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.
1175420	1177840	But the word he just used is literally a slur,
1177860	1179820	so I wonder if what you're being honest about
1179820	1181980	is your feelings toward disabled people.
1181980	1184780	Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance
1184780	1187420	is a little wordy, sure, but in this situation,
1187420	1188820	it's actually more accurate
1188820	1191140	since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,
1191140	1192980	anyone in need of assistance boarding.
1192980	1195020	So I call my gender confirmation surgery
1195020	1196420	getting a sex change,
1196420	1198380	not because it's more direct and honest,
1198380	1201620	but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated,
1201620	1203260	and that makes me laugh.
1203260	1205080	Not because I'm a fearless truth teller,
1205080	1206900	but because I'm a bad person.
1206920	1209840	And I get to call it my sex change operation,
1209840	1211960	but cis people don't get to call it that,
1211960	1215080	because it's my darkness, not yours.
1215080	1216200	Get your own darkness.
1216200	1218040	When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people,
1218040	1219200	he's being a hack,
1219200	1221280	because he knows nothing of our darkness.
1221280	1223040	And when someone tries to joke about something
1223040	1224680	that they're totally ignorant of,
1224680	1228000	the result is usually clumsy, awkward, and not very funny.
1228000	1230160	What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais
1230160	1233200	took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness
1233200	1235080	and turned it within.
1235100	1238460	Because within is where the darkness lies.
1238460	1241180	Six, self-deprecation.
1241180	1243580	Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite,
1243580	1247300	because as a lazy, selfish, preening attention whore
1247300	1249580	who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter
1249580	1251420	with the voice of a tropical bird,
1251420	1253500	there's a lot of material here to work with.
1253500	1255900	But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,
1255900	1258540	there is a faction of the trans community
1258540	1260860	that is not amused by the buffoonery
1260860	1262420	that goes on on this channel.
1262420	1264660	I think the objection to it is best summed up
1265240	1266360	by the comic Hannah Gatsby,
1266360	1268880	who in her stand-up special Nanette said
1268880	1271120	that when self-deprecation comes from someone
1271120	1273080	who exists in the margins.
1273080	1277800	It's not humility, it's humiliation.
1277800	1280720	And to be honest, I felt a little called out by that.
1280720	1283860	I put myself down in order to speak,
1283860	1286800	in order to seek permission to speak.
1286800	1289440	And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.
1289440	1292020	In order to gain an audience as a trans person,
1292040	1295760	you have to demonstrate what cis people call self-awareness.
1295760	1298880	That is, you have to signal that you see yourself
1298880	1301000	the way the audience sees you,
1301000	1302680	which can mean looking at yourself
1302680	1304720	with a pretty merciless gaze.
1304720	1306120	And of course I'm happy to do that,
1306120	1307880	because I have no self-respect
1307880	1310360	and laughter is the only way to numb the pain.
1310360	1312600	But the terrible thing about being a not normal
1312600	1316020	with an audience is that you don't just get to be yourself,
1316020	1317800	because whether you like it or not,
1317800	1321920	people will see you as a representative of the community,
1322820	1324980	so because of that responsibility,
1324980	1326380	which I never asked for,
1326380	1328820	I have to balance out the self-deprecation
1328820	1331900	with a lot of positive messaging about my people.
1331900	1334420	And that way, the dark chokes function
1334420	1338740	as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis go down.
1338740	1341420	But even without the group representation issue,
1341420	1345340	it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation too far.
1345340	1347620	As I've said, I have been diagnosed
1347620	1350220	with an incurable edginess of temperament,
1350240	1352160	and I sometimes do feel suffocated
1352160	1355160	by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces,
1355160	1357120	even though those spaces are there for good reason
1357120	1358360	and a lot of people need them.
1358360	1360840	But sometimes this atmosphere of everything
1360840	1362960	and everyone is valid all the time,
1362960	1365720	no uncomfortable questions may be asked,
1365720	1367520	any self-deprecation is a sign
1367520	1369840	of traumatic internalized bigotry,
1369840	1371760	I just need to get out of there for a while
1371760	1375320	and find a place where I can relax and be my edgy self.
1375320	1377920	I need a safe space for my edginess,
1377940	1379100	where I can just blurt out
1379100	1381820	whatever stupid question or joke comes to mind
1381820	1383620	without being afraid that I'm gonna inflict
1383620	1385720	horrible trauma on everyone around me.
1385720	1388820	So I call up another transsexual edge lady,
1388820	1391740	you know, kiki, accuse each other of being crossdressers,
1391740	1393660	and just laugh it all off.
1393660	1396140	And it's so, so cathartic to do that,
1396140	1399060	but it does have to be done in moderation,
1399060	1400420	because there can come a point
1400420	1403060	where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.
1403060	1405340	And it mostly has to be done in private,
1405340	1407460	because in public, you have to worry
1408000	1409960	about how cis people will interpret it,
1409960	1412680	and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating
1412680	1415480	without abandoning all social responsibility.
1415480	1417080	Ugh, if there was ever a phrase
1417080	1419080	that instantly deadens all laughter,
1419080	1420960	it's social responsibility.
1420960	1422840	But since it's kind of the central topic
1422840	1424400	of the comedy culture war,
1424400	1426480	I should probably say something about it,
1426480	1429260	even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back
1429260	1431520	to jabbering about my sex change.
1431520	1434100	Seven, the eternal tension.
1434100	1436040	So what is a comedian's job?
1436040	1437780	What is a comedian supposed to do?
1437780	1440020	I suppose my ideal comedian is one
1440020	1442640	who is perfectly able to balance the tension
1442640	1445380	between shitposting and snowflakery.
1445380	1447380	And this is an eternal tension,
1447380	1449300	and must never be resolved.
1449300	1452700	It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.
1452700	1455860	See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery,
1455860	1457620	you get a moralist who might say
1457620	1460280	that a comedian's purpose is to promote justice
1460280	1463020	by punching up, by speaking truth to power,
1463040	1466160	by exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.
1466160	1468240	And these are all very admirable goals,
1468240	1469600	but they leave out what I think
1469600	1471600	is the essential purpose of comedy,
1471600	1474380	which is to be funny, to surprise,
1474380	1476280	to shock, to make people laugh.
1476280	1478580	It's kind of like how some art and media critics
1478580	1480920	only ever evaluate a work based on whether or not
1480920	1482320	it's socially progressive,
1482320	1483720	and don't seem to really think
1483720	1485740	about aesthetic pleasure very much,
1485740	1488420	which, to me, is the reason why art exists
1488420	1489400	in the first place.
1489400	1492800	But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent,
1493580	1495380	and should probably be sent to the guillotine at once.
1495380	1496540	Just let me do my makeup first,
1496540	1497660	so that when they hold my head up,
1497660	1498740	everyone can see my beat,
1498740	1500300	and their wings all fly to the Bastille.
1500300	1502820	Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram,
1502820	1505940	cause that's gonna get a lot of engagement.
1505940	1507780	So the opposite of the pure snowflake
1507780	1509300	is the pure shit poster,
1509300	1510940	who might say that a comedian's purpose
1510940	1513600	is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.
1513600	1515300	But that seems kind of barbaric,
1515300	1517780	since like, if a guard at a prison camp
1517780	1520700	is torturing an inmate and the other guards are laughing,
1520700	1522220	does that count as comedy?
1522220	1523600	Is a war crime funny?
1523600	1528160	Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.
1528160	1529840	The thing is, I don't think many comedians
1529840	1531440	actually believe in a completely
1531440	1533320	nihilistic vision of comedy.
1533320	1535040	I think they sometimes pretend to
1535040	1536720	when they're trying to evade criticism.
1536720	1539640	I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,
1539640	1541800	and listen to the way they talk about their heroes,
1541800	1543600	Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.
1543600	1545400	There's always an element of admiration
1545400	1548760	for bravery, risk, subversion, truth-telling.
1548760	1550240	In other words, there's a concern there
1550260	1552460	for what is virtuous and what is true,
1552460	1554580	not just for what makes people laugh.
1554580	1557500	So maybe before we can even talk about what's funny,
1557500	1559380	we have to have a level of shared agreement
1559380	1561580	about what is true and what is morally right.
1561580	1564200	My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes
1564200	1566140	is not just that they're not funny.
1566140	1568500	I think he's wrong about trans people,
1568500	1570780	and I think his ignorance is infectious.
1570780	1574260	I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience,
1574260	1576340	which has the consequence of making the world
1576340	1578300	slightly scarier for people like me.
1578320	1581040	And this is edginess at its worst,
1581040	1583200	just a privileged person with a platform
1583200	1585440	punching down at a politically besieged group
1585440	1586920	he understands nothing about.
1586920	1589800	And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension
1589800	1591740	collapses into pure shitposting.
1591740	1595320	It's boring and immature, like when someone says
1595320	1597040	he wants to watch the world burn.
1597040	1599540	You only get to watch when you have the privilege
1599540	1601080	of not being on fire.
1601080	1603880	It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.
1603900	1608500	The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.
1608500	1610500	Edginess is always adolescent.
1610500	1614940	The darkness is edginess aged by time and pain.
1614940	1616940	And it's only at that full maturity
1616940	1618700	that comedy becomes art,
1618700	1621140	that it becomes comparable to music.
1621140	1624460	So, those are my thoughts.
1624460	1626380	Like, comment, and subscribe.
1627300	1628140	The end.
1631020	1632420	Fine, I'll sing the song.
1632720	1635720	I wish my brother, George, was here.
