00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
10 hours later...

00:30.000 --> 00:33.300
10 hours later...

00:33.300 --> 00:36.300
10 hours later...

00:36.300 --> 00:38.600
10 hours later...

00:38.600 --> 00:39.700
10 hours later...

00:39.700 --> 00:42.800
1. Hello, darkness.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.200
Hello, children.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.600
It is I, the darkness, within.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.800
So, you know how life is, like, kinda bad?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.700
Well, what are you gonna do about that, hmm?

00:53.700 --> 00:55.300
I mean, there's a few things you can do.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.800
First, you could work to improve yourself and make the world a better place.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.400
That's probably the most effective approach, eventually.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.500
But the problem is that it's hard.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.400
And I don't like things that are hard.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.800
10 hours later...

01:09.800 --> 01:11.600
Because when you do things that are hard,

01:11.600 --> 01:15.400
you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.300
And I don't wanna feel good later.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.900
I wanna feel good now.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.500
And if you want to feel good now, well, you have a couple options.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.200
The first is, of course, to do drugs.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
And I've tried that.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.600
I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.700
but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.900
It's not my vibe.

01:32.900 --> 01:35.900
So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming

01:35.900 --> 01:38.500
is what any respectable woman would do.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.400
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.200
Is it a pee under my mattress, Your Majesty?

01:45.200 --> 01:48.200
Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?

01:48.200 --> 01:51.400
Now, the problem with doing drugs is that when the drugs wear off,

01:51.400 --> 01:52.500
you feel bad again.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.400
In fact, you probably feel worse.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.200
So where do we go from here?

01:57.300 --> 02:00.000
Well, how about music?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.600
When you feel bad, you wanna listen to sad music

02:02.600 --> 02:05.300
because sad music makes you cry.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.800
And crying feels good.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.500
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.100
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness,

02:14.100 --> 02:17.600
The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel, you know?

02:17.600 --> 02:21.600
I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax under this throat rug.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.100
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

02:25.100 --> 02:27.400
But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds

02:27.400 --> 02:28.360
of the song.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.200
You only hear,

02:29.200 --> 02:30.840
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

02:30.840 --> 02:33.440
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,

02:33.440 --> 02:34.480
which is good.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.800
Because if you're making songs for sad people,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.760
it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.880
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.840
When you're sad, happy songs make you feel

02:46.840 --> 02:48.800
like you're being bullshitted.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.480
So we're 10 seconds into the song,

02:50.480 --> 02:52.280
♪ Hello, darkness, my old friend ♪

02:52.280 --> 02:56.060
The key is D-sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.660
But when we get to the next line,

02:57.660 --> 02:59.780
♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪

02:59.780 --> 03:01.220
Something happens.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.920
Let's listen.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.220
♪ Come to talk with you again ♪

03:07.220 --> 03:10.900
♪ Because a vision softly creeping ♪

03:10.900 --> 03:12.060
Ah!

03:12.060 --> 03:13.460
What was that?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.260
Suddenly a major chord,

03:15.260 --> 03:18.420
an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,

03:18.420 --> 03:20.740
and every peach fuzz hair on the back

03:20.760 --> 03:24.200
of my biologically female neck stands on end.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.720
Hello, light.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.280
So the song has enticed me

03:27.280 --> 03:29.480
with its promise of company from misery,

03:29.480 --> 03:33.040
and then it has tricked me into feeling good.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.600
And that's what I like about art.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.400
It takes the standard disappointments

03:36.400 --> 03:37.840
and humiliations of life

03:37.840 --> 03:39.440
and cooks them into something

03:39.440 --> 03:41.080
worth getting off the floor for.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.520
Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore

03:43.520 --> 03:46.400
because my hands are too beautiful for instruments

03:46.400 --> 03:48.240
and my singing voice sounds like a man.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.700
So all I really have left

03:49.700 --> 03:53.180
is what any aspiring artist with no talent turns to,

03:53.180 --> 03:54.100
comedy.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.780
And I especially like dark comedy.

03:56.780 --> 03:59.060
You know, comedy about the things in life

03:59.060 --> 04:00.460
that are the most painful.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.420
To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.

04:03.420 --> 04:06.180
It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties

04:06.180 --> 04:08.700
and twists them into a source of pleasure.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.620
And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

04:11.620 --> 04:12.460
Ah!

04:12.460 --> 04:15.100
A lot of the time, that means joking about topics

04:15.100 --> 04:17.500
that in ordinary life are considered taboo.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.800
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.120
Without the ability to joke

04:23.120 --> 04:25.760
and make fun of my own experiences of self-loathing,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.240
substance abuse, gender dysphoria,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.320
I mean, I'd probably be on the floor right now

04:30.320 --> 04:31.920
looking for that Xanax.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.200
But this puts me in a difficult situation

04:34.200 --> 04:36.040
because I want to defend my sense of humor,

04:36.040 --> 04:38.560
which I feel is like the core of my personality

04:38.560 --> 04:39.880
and what keeps me alive.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.160
But at the same time,

04:41.160 --> 04:43.540
I've noticed that a lot of the people in our culture

04:43.540 --> 04:45.940
who are really big on defending provocative,

04:45.960 --> 04:48.800
controversial, politically incorrect comedy

04:48.800 --> 04:52.360
are kind of, um, dick nuggets?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.600
Let's discuss this.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.840
And by discuss, I mean you sit quietly

04:55.840 --> 04:58.240
and I'll tell you what to think.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.580
Two, dick nuggets.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.720
So the year 2016 had just begun

05:02.720 --> 05:05.920
and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.920
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.100
was ranting on Twitter for days and days

05:12.100 --> 05:15.800
about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

05:16.660 --> 05:17.540
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,

05:17.540 --> 05:19.420
a man whose personal branding screams,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.660
I don't care about your feelings.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.220
I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.

05:25.220 --> 05:27.300
I'm too much of a badass rebel

05:27.300 --> 05:29.700
to care what minorities think.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.500
But in January 2016,

05:31.500 --> 05:34.340
Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,

05:34.340 --> 05:38.460
irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.

05:38.460 --> 05:39.500
Why?

05:39.500 --> 05:42.160
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes

05:42.160 --> 05:43.580
and upset a bunch of people

05:43.600 --> 05:46.760
by telling jokes about ol' tran-ma Caitlyn Jenner.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.520
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.840
I've changed.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.060
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.980
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.980
Very irreverent, very rebellious, very bad boy atheist.

06:00.980 --> 06:01.960
I mean, I do wish he wouldn't

06:01.960 --> 06:03.600
deadname trans people on stage,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.760
but honestly the joke wasn't even as transphobic

06:06.760 --> 06:09.840
as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.520
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,

06:14.360 --> 06:15.380
and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting

06:15.380 --> 06:17.900
about how offending people is good, actually,

06:17.900 --> 06:20.620
and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.580
But clearly, Twitter got to him,

06:22.580 --> 06:25.280
because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

06:25.280 --> 06:27.900
with a 13-minute bit rehashing the incident

06:27.900 --> 06:32.140
and doing a series of even more irreverent jokes.

06:32.140 --> 06:35.140
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

06:35.140 --> 06:36.340
Well, I am a chimp.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.020
If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.700
Pre-op, but...

06:41.420 --> 06:43.020
And don't ever deadname me.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.680
Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.120
From now on, you call me Bobo.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.800
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.040
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
in a $20 million comedy special?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.600
My issue with this joke is that,

06:56.600 --> 06:59.300
apart from being extremely passé and overdone,

06:59.300 --> 07:02.340
it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe

07:02.340 --> 07:04.240
that trans women are delusional men.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.960
And even then, it's just not very funny.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.240
But am I offended by the joke?

07:09.240 --> 07:11.920
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed,

07:11.940 --> 07:13.940
unoriginal, and not very funny.

07:13.940 --> 07:17.160
And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,

07:17.160 --> 07:20.460
to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame,

07:20.460 --> 07:22.860
badly delivered, and not funny enough.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.100
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this

07:25.100 --> 07:28.300
I-identify-as-a-chimp bit is pretty offensive.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.080
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up

07:30.080 --> 07:31.220
because I'm offended.

07:31.220 --> 07:34.180
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example

07:34.180 --> 07:36.620
of a cycle it seems like our culture repeats

07:36.620 --> 07:37.900
about once a week.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.340
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,

07:41.340 --> 07:43.400
and other people are indignant about the fact

07:43.400 --> 07:44.880
that those people are offended.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.980
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle

07:46.980 --> 07:49.520
and a culture war that's supposedly going on

07:49.520 --> 07:51.920
between generation-snowflake, easily-triggered,

07:51.920 --> 07:54.580
humorless PC cucks, and badass, edgy,

07:54.580 --> 07:57.080
nothing-off-limits free-speech truth-tellers.

07:57.080 --> 08:00.120
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,

08:00.120 --> 08:02.060
then I am a double agent,

08:02.060 --> 08:04.920
because I'm a generation-snowflake PC cuck

08:04.920 --> 08:06.760
who loves dank, edgy memes,

08:06.760 --> 08:08.620
and I've found myself on both sides

08:08.620 --> 08:11.320
of this type of conflict many, many times.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.340
So on the one hand, when I see the internet

08:13.340 --> 08:16.020
roasting a comedian for some shitty trans joke,

08:16.020 --> 08:19.060
my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

08:19.060 --> 08:22.020
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels

08:22.020 --> 08:24.140
to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.180
And as someone who basically writes jokes

08:26.180 --> 08:28.460
about controversial topics for a living,

08:28.460 --> 08:31.020
I appreciate how difficult it is

08:31.020 --> 08:35.940
to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

08:35.940 --> 08:38.420
while also keeping your moral compass

08:38.420 --> 08:40.380
from getting too jittery.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.520
So what I wanna try to do is step away

08:42.520 --> 08:45.200
from the heat of these social media battles

08:45.200 --> 08:46.960
and try to abstract from them

08:46.960 --> 08:49.720
some more general philosophical questions.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.320
What is the purpose of comedy?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.640
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

08:53.640 --> 08:56.760
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

08:56.760 --> 08:59.720
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

08:59.720 --> 09:01.600
Is it, as Aristotle said,

09:01.600 --> 09:04.460
the imitation of worse-than-average-men?

09:04.460 --> 09:07.000
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at

09:07.000 --> 09:08.600
for whatever reason?

09:08.620 --> 09:10.780
Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.880
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.540
but we can probably reach some kind of understanding

09:15.540 --> 09:17.100
by discussing this, right?

09:17.100 --> 09:20.500
And by we, again, I do mean me.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.980
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.820
Three, straw men.

09:24.820 --> 09:27.680
So, as a trans woman, up here discussing

09:27.680 --> 09:30.580
why I don't think Ricky Gervais's trans jokes are funny,

09:30.580 --> 09:32.660
a lot of haters and losers out there

09:32.660 --> 09:34.820
are probably gonna try to straw man me.

09:34.820 --> 09:39.680
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.320
Ugh, cis people have like two trans jokes,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.160
and they're both so bad.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.960
Here's the straw person's, assholes.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.520
Straw person one, you hate free speech

09:49.520 --> 09:51.600
and are trying to silence comedians.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.120
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.080
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage,

09:57.080 --> 09:59.920
and I can say whatever I want about them.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.920
Straw person two, you just can't take the heat

10:02.920 --> 10:04.560
when the joke's on you.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.380
I transitioned on YouTube,

10:06.380 --> 10:09.420
making controversial political content all the while,

10:09.420 --> 10:11.700
and I read the comments.

10:11.700 --> 10:16.220
My heat-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.860
Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing

10:18.860 --> 10:20.940
that has damaged my psyche irreparably,

10:20.940 --> 10:22.780
but sweetie, who doesn't?

10:22.780 --> 10:25.780
Straw person three, you think no one should be allowed

10:25.780 --> 10:27.580
to joke about trans people.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.820
I invented joking about trans people.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.580
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

10:32.580 --> 10:33.580
I'm that tran.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.560
That's right, if I die tomorrow,

10:35.560 --> 10:39.240
my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology

10:39.240 --> 10:42.520
to fellatio, and I accept my destiny.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.480
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.440
I live for trans jokes.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.280
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.320
because they don't know enough about trans people

10:52.320 --> 10:54.080
to know what the funny things are.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.600
And being transgender is honestly

10:55.600 --> 10:57.160
the perfect topic for comedy.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.200
Like, you used to live as one gender,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.360
and then you became a different gender.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.820
Every single thing about that, it's absolutely hilarious.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.740
But humor is in the details,

11:06.740 --> 11:09.100
and Ricky Gervais does not know the details,

11:09.100 --> 11:11.660
because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,

11:11.660 --> 11:12.940
and that's why he's still telling

11:12.940 --> 11:15.660
these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.

11:15.660 --> 11:18.100
And it's too bad, because I'm actually starving over here

11:18.100 --> 11:20.980
for good trans comedy, and I mean the real dark stuff too.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.260
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline

11:23.260 --> 11:24.940
calling her hormones titty skittles.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.740
No, I like the edgy stuff.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.180
I like being on the edge.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.800
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen, and I enjoy edging.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.200
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy

11:35.200 --> 11:36.560
that I'd like to share with you,

11:36.560 --> 11:38.840
because when you're doing art criticism,

11:38.840 --> 11:41.600
it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.820
And the exemplary work I have in mind

11:43.820 --> 11:46.540
is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.280
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company

11:49.280 --> 11:51.200
as the works of Dante or Swift.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.640
I am, of course, referring

11:52.640 --> 11:55.840
to My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgeous.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.120
If you don't know who Gigi is,

11:57.140 --> 11:58.420
first of all, who even are you?

11:58.420 --> 11:59.980
Do you have no respect for legends?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.860
She's a trans YouTuber, like the trans YouTuber,

12:02.860 --> 12:05.220
whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

12:05.220 --> 12:07.140
and I Had Sex with a Dog

12:07.140 --> 12:10.300
long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.860
But in this critic's opinion,

12:11.860 --> 12:15.260
the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre is without a doubt

12:15.260 --> 12:18.540
the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.780
Let's do a close reading.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.700
Four, Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.180
A great work of literature is never just a text.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.520
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson

12:29.520 --> 12:33.480
would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.300
Love that.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.920
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience

12:36.920 --> 12:38.680
within its proper context.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.960
Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video

12:40.960 --> 12:42.380
about how she and her girlfriend

12:42.380 --> 12:45.160
were trying to have a child, so far without success,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.720
and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.640
Apparently Gigi was not aware

12:49.640 --> 12:52.160
that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,

12:52.160 --> 12:54.880
which, girl, they tell you like seven times

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
before you start hormones.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.100
Like, how?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.220
We'll move past it.

12:58.220 --> 12:59.820
A few months later, the notification

12:59.820 --> 13:02.500
for My Sperm Bank Experience shows up on my phone,

13:02.500 --> 13:04.260
because that's right, I clicked the bell,

13:04.260 --> 13:05.820
and immediately I knew I was about

13:05.820 --> 13:07.620
to experience something special.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.980
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater

13:09.980 --> 13:11.820
than anything I've ever conceived of

13:11.820 --> 13:13.980
that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,

13:13.980 --> 13:15.940
both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.820
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.260
The eyes are dotted with hearts.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.500
And her facial expression.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.880
Ew.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.800
Gum.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.760
The video begins with Gigi explaining

13:27.760 --> 13:29.960
that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,

13:29.960 --> 13:32.560
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.160
So I hesitantly agreed.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.240
I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones

13:36.240 --> 13:38.640
so, you know, my shit can get juicy again

13:38.640 --> 13:40.520
and I can get a good little sample up in here.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.920
The sperm bank day arrives, she goes to the clinic,

13:42.920 --> 13:44.680
and approaches the receptionist.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.680
And I said, yes ma'am, I am here to give sperm

13:48.680 --> 13:52.320
from me to be frozen now.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.700
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,

13:54.700 --> 13:58.220
which she describes with the precision of Mama Flaubert.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.100
I walk into this room, fluorescent lighting, the house.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.100
I was like, I can see every pore in my arm.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.020
Like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?

14:05.020 --> 14:07.820
And then the kicker, this like leather couch,

14:07.820 --> 14:09.740
the back is kind of like angled,

14:09.740 --> 14:11.220
so I guess like you can lean

14:11.220 --> 14:13.020
and really get into it or something.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.460
The doctor offers her lubrication, pornography if needed,

14:16.460 --> 14:17.740
and a donation cup.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.060
Gigi closes the door and gets to work.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.020
I get in the mood, I get in the zone,

14:22.720 --> 14:23.560
and I'm killing it, bitch.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.520
I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.720
My kid is gonna be a God sent child.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.000
Before I know it, the moment has crept up on me,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.480
it happened, and it's been so long

14:32.480 --> 14:34.880
that it hits the wall behind me.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.120
And it's at this moment that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous

14:38.120 --> 14:41.200
gets up off the leather couch and attempts to scrape

14:41.200 --> 14:43.960
a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism

14:43.960 --> 14:46.480
off the wall of a fluorescent lit exam room

14:46.480 --> 14:49.200
in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.140
And I took the cup and I was like full on

14:51.140 --> 14:53.200
like scraping it off the wall because I was like,

14:53.200 --> 14:55.180
I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.100
You know, I'm here, this is like my moment.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.620
I'm trying to understand why this video

14:58.620 --> 15:00.380
makes me laugh so much.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.780
It's really the contrast of style and substance.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.140
Like it wouldn't be funny if a masculine person

15:05.140 --> 15:06.220
told this story.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.860
It's funny because Gigi has this peak feminine

15:08.860 --> 15:11.860
storytelling style in this Real Housewives diction,

15:11.860 --> 15:15.880
but the story itself is about blasting a giant load

15:15.880 --> 15:18.740
onto a wall of a room full of leather and pornography.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.000
The dissonance between form and content is genius.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.680
And that dissonance perfectly captures the absurdity

15:24.680 --> 15:27.520
of being transgender with a comedic incisiveness

15:27.520 --> 15:29.980
that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.440
I also really relate to this story

15:31.440 --> 15:33.360
because right before I started hormones,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.720
I decided to freeze a sample of my own

15:35.720 --> 15:38.760
so I too have a sperm bank experience.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.920
And it was exactly like Gigi describes,

15:40.920 --> 15:42.320
down to every detail.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.360
It is not a dignified moment, ladies.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.380
There is just no way to feel like a woman

15:46.380 --> 15:48.340
while you're hastily rubbing one out

15:48.900 --> 15:51.240
in an overlit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.940
I feel so fish right now.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.720
For this five minutes in the exam room, I was a man.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.780
Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample

15:58.780 --> 16:00.520
into the cup, but there's a different

16:00.520 --> 16:02.080
absurd detail to my story.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.820
The receptionist at the sperm bank saw on my paperwork

16:04.820 --> 16:07.120
that I was depositing because I was going

16:07.120 --> 16:09.600
to start feminizing hormones, and he asked me

16:09.600 --> 16:11.640
if there was a name I preferred he called me.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.840
In retrospect, he was actually really sweet

16:13.840 --> 16:14.680
and really cute.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.300
Not that anything was gonna come of that at the time

16:16.300 --> 16:19.640
since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.880
Be honest, I was all edges.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.320
But he asked me for my preferred name

16:22.320 --> 16:24.200
and I just blurted out Natalie.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.360
And so this was actually the first time

16:26.360 --> 16:28.820
anyone ever called me by my biological name.

16:28.820 --> 16:29.860
And it went like this.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.280
The receptionist at the sperm bank turned to me

16:32.280 --> 16:34.440
and said, right this way, Natalie.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.800
Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.520
And that's how my life as a woman began.

16:39.520 --> 16:44.520
Now in the end, Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.300
Her sample wasn't usable.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.220
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,

16:48.220 --> 16:51.040
but she's been on hormones too long and she just can't.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.780
And that revelation at the end of the video

16:52.780 --> 16:55.540
kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.180
In this ridiculous image of Gigi

16:57.180 --> 16:59.060
scraping ejaculate off the wall,

16:59.060 --> 17:01.460
I now see this primal maternal urge

17:01.460 --> 17:03.300
to produce and protect children.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.660
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen

17:05.660 --> 17:07.380
prematurely from the nest.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.100
I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.480
I really, really thought that I was gonna have

17:12.480 --> 17:14.200
a good sample and I was gonna be able

17:14.880 --> 17:16.660
to participate in having a baby with my DNA,

17:16.660 --> 17:18.540
but it's just not in the cards for me.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.980
And I really wanted to make this video

17:19.980 --> 17:22.980
more positive and funny because there is nothing I can do.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.820
And that's exactly it.

17:24.820 --> 17:27.300
That is the darkness.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.520
Five, the darkness.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.080
The darkness is my name for what I consider

17:32.080 --> 17:33.940
the highest form of comedy,

17:33.940 --> 17:35.620
where you take your own worst feelings,

17:35.620 --> 17:36.940
traumas, and anxieties,

17:36.940 --> 17:39.620
and twist them into a source of pleasure.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.460
The darkness is Richard Pryor

17:41.460 --> 17:42.900
running down the street in flames

17:42.900 --> 17:45.880
because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.640
The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous

17:47.640 --> 17:49.480
scraping her own prodigious jism

17:49.480 --> 17:50.780
off the wall of an exam room

17:50.780 --> 17:53.280
in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.480
If you can make these low points funny,

17:55.480 --> 17:57.000
then you're gonna be okay.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.120
You're gonna survive.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.640
You're gonna make it through life.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.680
And I need that now more than ever

18:01.680 --> 18:05.320
because trans experience is, in a lot of ways, pretty dark.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.600
But trans people make it through

18:06.600 --> 18:09.640
because we're good-humored and strong as fuck.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.560
Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones

18:11.580 --> 18:14.100
before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.

18:14.100 --> 18:16.060
What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?

18:16.060 --> 18:17.700
Am I gonna become a man again?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.140
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.560
I am thinking about names, though,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.900
like maybe Nathan or Jaden.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.580
I can see myself as a Jaden.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.580
See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes

18:26.580 --> 18:28.220
or I don't think I can make it through this.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.620
Like, when I have bottom surgery,

18:29.620 --> 18:32.460
I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it

18:32.460 --> 18:35.340
as my sex-change operation

18:35.340 --> 18:37.260
because it makes me laugh, it brings me joy.

18:37.260 --> 18:40.900
Calling it gender confirmation surgery brings me no joy.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.360
Now, it's important to notice

18:42.360 --> 18:44.280
that just because it doesn't make me laugh

18:44.280 --> 18:46.960
doesn't mean it's a politically correct euphemism.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.720
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term than sex change

18:50.720 --> 18:53.000
because you're literally not changing your sex.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.680
That's not what surgery does.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.200
But edgy people have their own kind of political correctness

18:58.200 --> 19:00.040
where they mistake edginess

19:00.040 --> 19:02.520
for honesty, accuracy, and directness,

19:02.520 --> 19:04.400
but these are very different things.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.720
For example, George Carlin has a classic bit

19:06.720 --> 19:09.440
about euphemisms that has some great moments,

19:09.460 --> 19:12.180
but also some moments that are way off base.

19:12.180 --> 19:15.140
For example, content-wording ableist slur.

19:15.140 --> 19:16.780
They say they're going to pre-board

19:16.780 --> 19:20.500
those passengers in need of special assistance.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.700
Cripples!

19:22.820 --> 19:25.420
Simple, honest, direct language.

19:25.420 --> 19:27.900
So look, I understand the aesthetic preference

19:27.900 --> 19:29.980
for simple, honest, direct language

19:29.980 --> 19:32.900
and the repulsion toward verbose bureaucratic jargon.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.420
That's why so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.840
But the word he just used is literally a slur,

19:37.860 --> 19:39.820
so I wonder if what you're being honest about

19:39.820 --> 19:41.980
is your feelings toward disabled people.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.780
Because the phrase passengers in need of special assistance

19:44.780 --> 19:47.420
is a little wordy, sure, but in this situation,

19:47.420 --> 19:48.820
it's actually more accurate

19:48.820 --> 19:51.140
since it also includes the elderly, the pregnant,

19:51.140 --> 19:52.980
anyone in need of assistance boarding.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.020
So I call my gender confirmation surgery

19:55.020 --> 19:56.420
getting a sex change,

19:56.420 --> 19:58.380
not because it's more direct and honest,

19:58.380 --> 20:01.620
but specifically because it's inaccurate and outdated,

20:01.620 --> 20:03.260
and that makes me laugh.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.080
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller,

20:05.080 --> 20:06.900
but because I'm a bad person.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.840
And I get to call it my sex change operation,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.960
but cis people don't get to call it that,

20:11.960 --> 20:15.080
because it's my darkness, not yours.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.200
Get your own darkness.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.040
When Ricky Gervais jokes about trans people,

20:18.040 --> 20:19.200
he's being a hack,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.280
because he knows nothing of our darkness.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.040
And when someone tries to joke about something

20:23.040 --> 20:24.680
that they're totally ignorant of,

20:24.680 --> 20:28.000
the result is usually clumsy, awkward, and not very funny.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.160
What I'd really like to see is if Ricky Gervais

20:30.160 --> 20:33.200
took all of that irreverent bad boy derisiveness

20:33.200 --> 20:35.080
and turned it within.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.460
Because within is where the darkness lies.

20:38.460 --> 20:41.180
Six, self-deprecation.

20:41.180 --> 20:43.580
Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite,

20:43.580 --> 20:47.300
because as a lazy, selfish, preening attention whore

20:47.300 --> 20:49.580
who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter

20:49.580 --> 20:51.420
with the voice of a tropical bird,

20:51.420 --> 20:53.500
there's a lot of material here to work with.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.900
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,

20:55.900 --> 20:58.540
there is a faction of the trans community

20:58.540 --> 21:00.860
that is not amused by the buffoonery

21:00.860 --> 21:02.420
that goes on on this channel.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.660
I think the objection to it is best summed up

21:05.240 --> 21:06.360
by the comic Hannah Gatsby,

21:06.360 --> 21:08.880
who in her stand-up special Nanette said

21:08.880 --> 21:11.120
that when self-deprecation comes from someone

21:11.120 --> 21:13.080
who exists in the margins.

21:13.080 --> 21:17.800
It's not humility, it's humiliation.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.720
And to be honest, I felt a little called out by that.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.860
I put myself down in order to speak,

21:23.860 --> 21:26.800
in order to seek permission to speak.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.440
And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.020
In order to gain an audience as a trans person,

21:32.040 --> 21:35.760
you have to demonstrate what cis people call self-awareness.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.880
That is, you have to signal that you see yourself

21:38.880 --> 21:41.000
the way the audience sees you,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.680
which can mean looking at yourself

21:42.680 --> 21:44.720
with a pretty merciless gaze.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.120
And of course I'm happy to do that,

21:46.120 --> 21:47.880
because I have no self-respect

21:47.880 --> 21:50.360
and laughter is the only way to numb the pain.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.600
But the terrible thing about being a not normal

21:52.600 --> 21:56.020
with an audience is that you don't just get to be yourself,

21:56.020 --> 21:57.800
because whether you like it or not,

21:57.800 --> 22:01.920
people will see you as a representative of the community,

22:02.820 --> 22:04.980
so because of that responsibility,

22:04.980 --> 22:06.380
which I never asked for,

22:06.380 --> 22:08.820
I have to balance out the self-deprecation

22:08.820 --> 22:11.900
with a lot of positive messaging about my people.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.420
And that way, the dark chokes function

22:14.420 --> 22:18.740
as a spoonful of sugar to help the feminine penis go down.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.420
But even without the group representation issue,

22:21.420 --> 22:25.340
it definitely is possible to take self-deprecation too far.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.620
As I've said, I have been diagnosed

22:27.620 --> 22:30.220
with an incurable edginess of temperament,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.160
and I sometimes do feel suffocated

22:32.160 --> 22:35.160
by the safe space rules of a lot of trans spaces,

22:35.160 --> 22:37.120
even though those spaces are there for good reason

22:37.120 --> 22:38.360
and a lot of people need them.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.840
But sometimes this atmosphere of everything

22:40.840 --> 22:42.960
and everyone is valid all the time,

22:42.960 --> 22:45.720
no uncomfortable questions may be asked,

22:45.720 --> 22:47.520
any self-deprecation is a sign

22:47.520 --> 22:49.840
of traumatic internalized bigotry,

22:49.840 --> 22:51.760
I just need to get out of there for a while

22:51.760 --> 22:55.320
and find a place where I can relax and be my edgy self.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.920
I need a safe space for my edginess,

22:57.940 --> 22:59.100
where I can just blurt out

22:59.100 --> 23:01.820
whatever stupid question or joke comes to mind

23:01.820 --> 23:03.620
without being afraid that I'm gonna inflict

23:03.620 --> 23:05.720
horrible trauma on everyone around me.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.820
So I call up another transsexual edge lady,

23:08.820 --> 23:11.740
you know, kiki, accuse each other of being crossdressers,

23:11.740 --> 23:13.660
and just laugh it all off.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.140
And it's so, so cathartic to do that,

23:16.140 --> 23:19.060
but it does have to be done in moderation,

23:19.060 --> 23:20.420
because there can come a point

23:20.420 --> 23:23.060
where you're picking at the wound instead of numbing it.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.340
And it mostly has to be done in private,

23:25.340 --> 23:27.460
because in public, you have to worry

23:28.000 --> 23:29.960
about how cis people will interpret it,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.680
and so you have to find a way to be self-deprecating

23:32.680 --> 23:35.480
without abandoning all social responsibility.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.080
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase

23:37.080 --> 23:39.080
that instantly deadens all laughter,

23:39.080 --> 23:40.960
it's social responsibility.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.840
But since it's kind of the central topic

23:42.840 --> 23:44.400
of the comedy culture war,

23:44.400 --> 23:46.480
I should probably say something about it,

23:46.480 --> 23:49.260
even though, believe me, I'd much rather go back

23:49.260 --> 23:51.520
to jabbering about my sex change.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.100
Seven, the eternal tension.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.040
So what is a comedian's job?

23:56.040 --> 23:57.780
What is a comedian supposed to do?

23:57.780 --> 24:00.020
I suppose my ideal comedian is one

24:00.020 --> 24:02.640
who is perfectly able to balance the tension

24:02.640 --> 24:05.380
between shitposting and snowflakery.

24:05.380 --> 24:07.380
And this is an eternal tension,

24:07.380 --> 24:09.300
and must never be resolved.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.700
It is a tightrope I have devoted my life to walking.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.860
See, if the tension collapses into pure snowflakery,

24:15.860 --> 24:17.620
you get a moralist who might say

24:17.620 --> 24:20.280
that a comedian's purpose is to promote justice

24:20.280 --> 24:23.020
by punching up, by speaking truth to power,

24:23.040 --> 24:26.160
by exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets, and so on.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.240
And these are all very admirable goals,

24:28.240 --> 24:29.600
but they leave out what I think

24:29.600 --> 24:31.600
is the essential purpose of comedy,

24:31.600 --> 24:34.380
which is to be funny, to surprise,

24:34.380 --> 24:36.280
to shock, to make people laugh.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.580
It's kind of like how some art and media critics

24:38.580 --> 24:40.920
only ever evaluate a work based on whether or not

24:40.920 --> 24:42.320
it's socially progressive,

24:42.320 --> 24:43.720
and don't seem to really think

24:43.720 --> 24:45.740
about aesthetic pleasure very much,

24:45.740 --> 24:48.420
which, to me, is the reason why art exists

24:48.420 --> 24:49.400
in the first place.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.800
But then again, I am a hedonistic bourgeois decadent,

24:53.580 --> 24:55.380
and should probably be sent to the guillotine at once.

24:55.380 --> 24:56.540
Just let me do my makeup first,

24:56.540 --> 24:57.660
so that when they hold my head up,

24:57.660 --> 24:58.740
everyone can see my beat,

24:58.740 --> 25:00.300
and their wings all fly to the Bastille.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.820
Also, someone please post the video to my Instagram,

25:02.820 --> 25:05.940
cause that's gonna get a lot of engagement.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.780
So the opposite of the pure snowflake

25:07.780 --> 25:09.300
is the pure shit poster,

25:09.300 --> 25:10.940
who might say that a comedian's purpose

25:10.940 --> 25:13.600
is to make an audience laugh by any means necessary.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.300
But that seems kind of barbaric,

25:15.300 --> 25:17.780
since like, if a guard at a prison camp

25:17.780 --> 25:20.700
is torturing an inmate and the other guards are laughing,

25:20.700 --> 25:22.220
does that count as comedy?

25:22.220 --> 25:23.600
Is a war crime funny?

25:23.600 --> 25:28.160
Well, according to the Geneva Convention, it's hilarious.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.840
The thing is, I don't think many comedians

25:29.840 --> 25:31.440
actually believe in a completely

25:31.440 --> 25:33.320
nihilistic vision of comedy.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.040
I think they sometimes pretend to

25:35.040 --> 25:36.720
when they're trying to evade criticism.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.640
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,

25:39.640 --> 25:41.800
and listen to the way they talk about their heroes,

25:41.800 --> 25:43.600
Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.400
There's always an element of admiration

25:45.400 --> 25:48.760
for bravery, risk, subversion, truth-telling.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.240
In other words, there's a concern there

25:50.260 --> 25:52.460
for what is virtuous and what is true,

25:52.460 --> 25:54.580
not just for what makes people laugh.

25:54.580 --> 25:57.500
So maybe before we can even talk about what's funny,

25:57.500 --> 25:59.380
we have to have a level of shared agreement

25:59.380 --> 26:01.580
about what is true and what is morally right.

26:01.580 --> 26:04.200
My objection to Ricky Gervais's trans jokes

26:04.200 --> 26:06.140
is not just that they're not funny.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.500
I think he's wrong about trans people,

26:08.500 --> 26:10.780
and I think his ignorance is infectious.

26:10.780 --> 26:14.260
I think he's stirring up bigoted sentiments in his audience,

26:14.260 --> 26:16.340
which has the consequence of making the world

26:16.340 --> 26:18.300
slightly scarier for people like me.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.040
And this is edginess at its worst,

26:21.040 --> 26:23.200
just a privileged person with a platform

26:23.200 --> 26:25.440
punching down at a politically besieged group

26:25.440 --> 26:26.920
he understands nothing about.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.800
And that's what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension

26:29.800 --> 26:31.740
collapses into pure shitposting.

26:31.740 --> 26:35.320
It's boring and immature, like when someone says

26:35.320 --> 26:37.040
he wants to watch the world burn.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.540
You only get to watch when you have the privilege

26:39.540 --> 26:41.080
of not being on fire.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.880
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

26:43.900 --> 26:48.500
The darkness is finding a way to laugh about being on fire.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.500
Edginess is always adolescent.

26:50.500 --> 26:54.940
The darkness is edginess aged by time and pain.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.940
And it's only at that full maturity

26:56.940 --> 26:58.700
that comedy becomes art,

26:58.700 --> 27:01.140
that it becomes comparable to music.

27:01.140 --> 27:04.460
So, those are my thoughts.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.380
Like, comment, and subscribe.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.140
The end.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.420
Fine, I'll sing the song.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.720
