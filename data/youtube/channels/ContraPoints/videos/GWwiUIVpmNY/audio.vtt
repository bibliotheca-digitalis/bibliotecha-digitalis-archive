00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.280
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,

00:11.280 --> 00:15.040
and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.200
Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,

00:21.200 --> 00:26.640
well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists,

00:26.640 --> 00:31.040
tag team title match tonight at nine, or if you're lucky, you get this.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.560
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent

00:34.560 --> 00:38.560
black people of crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black

00:38.560 --> 00:42.160
are making bad choices for which they have to deal with the consequences.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.160
Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad that happens to black people. If blacks

00:46.160 --> 00:49.840
are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.

00:49.840 --> 00:54.160
That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide

00:54.160 --> 00:57.520
to commit more crimes for no reason. I guess he's probably gonna blame the rap music.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.320
Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.160
I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright

01:04.160 --> 01:08.640
fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the

01:08.640 --> 01:14.240
product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually

01:14.240 --> 01:18.720
this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality,

01:18.720 --> 01:21.920
and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.400
They make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.280
This is what I'm going to argue against in this video. We're going to take a break

01:27.280 --> 01:31.440
from talking about fascism. In the past I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think

01:31.440 --> 01:34.800
we all have. I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.800
but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.080
In this video I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,

01:42.080 --> 01:45.280
which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.880
And from now on I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of

01:48.880 --> 01:54.880
pepes and racist odinists and neo-nazi larpers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind

01:54.880 --> 02:00.640
of over it. Oh god damn it. Hallo Leute. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you

02:00.640 --> 02:06.880
anymore. Nein, ich heiÃŸe nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.240
Great. Get out. Well don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.360
You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good

02:17.360 --> 02:22.000
question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense. Get out.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.520
She calls me a Nazi and yet she's the one trying to silence my free speech. An excellent example

02:27.520 --> 02:32.320
of how truly fascist the left has become. Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny,

02:32.320 --> 02:35.840
why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas? Well I'm going to discuss

02:35.840 --> 02:40.640
them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.360
Well can we at least talk about the Jewish question? No. It's just ideas. What are you

02:45.360 --> 02:48.880
afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of

02:48.880 --> 02:55.120
here in ten seconds. Ten. Nine. Oh baby, come on. I thought you liked to be. Six. You used to whisper

02:55.120 --> 03:02.640
to me so sweetly. Will not anymore. Well do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax? Okay, Jesus.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.960
I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about disagreements. I don't

03:08.960 --> 03:14.160
enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat but it's these people, they just give you no choice.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.920
Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people about this issue,

03:17.920 --> 03:21.840
they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.

03:21.840 --> 03:26.400
One, by saying you're racist. And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.480
And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience

03:30.480 --> 03:34.560
a lot of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,

03:34.560 --> 03:39.760
no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are

03:39.760 --> 03:44.880
more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it,

03:44.880 --> 03:48.960
the left needs to step it up. Now to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on

03:48.960 --> 03:53.520
Twitter to demand they explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole. And it's true,

03:53.520 --> 03:57.840
it's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do with their lives. But I,

03:57.840 --> 04:01.920
on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my lane and

04:01.920 --> 04:05.920
white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,

04:05.920 --> 04:12.960
and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time. Whose job is it to mend

04:12.960 --> 04:17.280
the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a

04:17.280 --> 04:23.280
long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July. This person,

04:23.280 --> 04:28.240
who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this is about.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.560
That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears. Here,

04:33.360 --> 04:34.560
I'll pick you out a cotton ball.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.280
1. Freddie Gray

04:47.280 --> 04:52.720
On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested a

04:52.720 --> 04:57.760
25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that

04:57.760 --> 05:01.520
maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.

05:02.640 --> 05:08.320
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason,

05:08.320 --> 05:13.680
with three fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of

05:13.680 --> 05:17.840
his spinal injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information

05:17.840 --> 05:22.080
about his arrest. This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the

05:22.080 --> 05:26.480
notorious Baltimore riots. Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism

05:26.480 --> 05:29.520
if black people don't want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from

05:29.520 --> 05:34.240
the police? Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent

05:34.240 --> 05:38.880
crimes shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming

05:38.880 --> 05:42.960
to me how quick you are to defend this. And the other problem is that that's a very superficial

05:42.960 --> 05:47.200
analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have

05:47.200 --> 05:51.680
more poverty, more crime, and are subject to more aggressive policing. So let's delve a little

05:51.680 --> 05:55.840
deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study. Gray had a long arrest record of mostly

05:55.840 --> 06:00.080
drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators brought this out as evidence that he

06:00.080 --> 06:05.840
was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, that he

06:05.840 --> 06:10.080
deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place? I don't think he was

06:10.080 --> 06:15.280
selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just do it for no reason?

06:15.280 --> 06:19.600
Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,

06:19.600 --> 06:24.160
Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated

06:24.240 --> 06:29.200
row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress

06:29.200 --> 06:34.000
banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to

06:34.000 --> 06:38.640
deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead

06:38.640 --> 06:42.960
are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up in the

06:42.960 --> 06:47.920
juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with

06:47.920 --> 06:53.360
a congressional ban on lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have

06:53.360 --> 06:57.600
been added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children

06:57.600 --> 07:02.080
are black. Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for

07:02.080 --> 07:06.560
permanent brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking,

07:06.560 --> 07:12.080
well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's

07:12.080 --> 07:16.960
happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims,

07:16.960 --> 07:21.040
some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their structured monthly

07:21.040 --> 07:25.120
settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.080
And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding

07:30.080 --> 07:37.040
bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's

07:37.040 --> 07:43.920
settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray sibling settlement for $54,000. Now,

07:43.920 --> 07:48.720
I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad. But to understand how it relates to structural

07:48.720 --> 07:53.040
racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just

07:53.040 --> 07:57.440
keep doing live streams with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.000
God damn it. I need to relax. I need music.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.720
2. Housing Discrimination

08:08.720 --> 08:12.960
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead

08:12.960 --> 08:18.160
levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

08:18.160 --> 08:24.160
Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white. Lead. Race. Lead.

08:24.720 --> 08:29.040
Race. Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.480
Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.800
I thought racism was over.

08:34.800 --> 08:39.840
Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,

08:39.840 --> 08:43.200
Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,

08:43.280 --> 08:48.560
Oops. Sorry about that. It's all cool now though, right?

08:48.560 --> 08:53.600
No. It's not cool. And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not-cool

08:53.600 --> 08:57.440
things. Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place. I hope I'm not being too

08:57.440 --> 09:02.880
controversial if I propose that, a hundred years ago, America may have been somewhat racist.

09:02.880 --> 09:08.480
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

09:08.480 --> 09:12.720
white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city

09:12.720 --> 09:17.920
passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance

09:17.920 --> 09:22.720
forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,

09:22.720 --> 09:26.000
until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.920
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem? Racism can't

09:29.920 --> 09:32.720
exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.000
Well, no. That's actually not correct.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.560
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the

09:40.560 --> 09:45.120
midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed. One of the FHA's purposes was to

09:45.120 --> 09:49.200
establish a reliable credit system backed by the government, which would regulate interest rates

09:49.200 --> 09:53.840
and ensure the terms of mortgages. FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating

09:53.840 --> 09:57.840
homeownership throughout the middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now

09:57.840 --> 10:02.080
remember as the golden age of the American dream. But many black Americans were excluded from

10:02.080 --> 10:06.080
homeownership and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family

10:06.080 --> 10:09.840
financial stability it enabled. So how was this exclusion possible?

10:09.840 --> 10:14.800
Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle

10:14.800 --> 10:19.120
methods to enforce residential segregation and deny homeownership to black Americans.

10:19.120 --> 10:19.920
For instance,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.680
1. Restrictive Covenants

10:21.680 --> 10:27.200
When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

10:27.200 --> 10:31.600
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods

10:31.600 --> 10:35.360
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.680
These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued against

10:39.680 --> 10:43.200
owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.560
2. Redlining

10:44.560 --> 10:48.960
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,

10:48.960 --> 10:52.400
which were colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name

10:52.400 --> 10:57.360
redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which,

10:57.360 --> 10:59.200
in turn, left them vulnerable to

10:59.200 --> 11:00.800
3. Predatory Lending

11:00.800 --> 11:05.200
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed

11:05.200 --> 11:09.440
mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
with abusive terms, which allowed, for instance,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.360
sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single missed payment.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.960
Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts,

11:18.960 --> 11:23.440
and they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,

11:23.440 --> 11:26.720
further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.240
4. Blockbusting

11:28.240 --> 11:32.000
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.680
where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among

11:35.680 --> 11:39.360
residents of a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created

11:39.360 --> 11:43.040
to trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below-market prices,

11:43.040 --> 11:46.320
so they could resell those same houses at extortionate prices

11:46.320 --> 11:48.560
to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.400
The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped

11:52.400 --> 11:57.440
in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,

11:57.440 --> 11:59.520
and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.520
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains

12:03.520 --> 12:08.080
unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of

12:08.080 --> 12:12.560
homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated

12:12.560 --> 12:15.040
500 million dollars in Chicago alone.

12:15.040 --> 12:19.040
But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed

12:19.040 --> 12:21.760
discrimination of the last century is still ongoing.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.960
I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood,

12:24.960 --> 12:28.000
like one mile away from where Freddie Gray was arrested,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.160
in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.040
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.320
Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.760
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is,

12:39.760 --> 12:44.160
and if the city still follows the same pattern of segregation today, and it does,

12:44.160 --> 12:49.600
well, it's almost as if the effects of racism have not entirely been eradicated.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.840
And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.720
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit,

12:56.800 --> 12:58.720
New Orleans, Cleveland, LA.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.960
All these cities are still segregated as shit,

13:00.960 --> 13:03.600
and it's not like a separate-but-equal situation either.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.880
Compare the 2013 population-by-race map of Baltimore

13:06.880 --> 13:10.320
to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.800
That's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

13:12.800 --> 13:14.800
recorded police stops of black pedestrians.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.760
And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.760
Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead

13:23.760 --> 13:28.560
exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems going on here

13:28.560 --> 13:33.440
that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.000
But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.960
because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.960
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,

13:42.960 --> 13:47.840
the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools,

13:47.840 --> 13:51.280
and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of injustice

13:51.280 --> 13:53.520
as if it were simply a problem of criminality.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.400
I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt,

13:56.400 --> 14:00.480
and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

14:02.400 --> 14:07.680
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.680
You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.

14:11.680 --> 14:16.720
As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra,

14:17.360 --> 14:20.080
Black Lives Matter are the real racists.

14:20.080 --> 14:24.720
3. Mass Incarceration

14:24.720 --> 14:28.880
Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen

14:28.880 --> 14:32.880
to the point where nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.360
We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world,

14:35.360 --> 14:41.280
accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.160
More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black,

14:44.160 --> 14:47.360
and the black incarceration rate is almost six times that of whites.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.600
Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.040
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison,

14:55.040 --> 14:57.360
too many defendants are pressured into plea bargains,

14:57.360 --> 15:00.960
and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of incarceration.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.240
But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.120
Now a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

15:07.120 --> 15:10.160
if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.080
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.240
You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?

15:14.240 --> 15:15.280
Every single YouTuber.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.960
Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.

15:18.960 --> 15:23.040
Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream,

15:23.040 --> 15:26.480
and then we can finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.360
God damn it.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.640
Where's my toad venom?

15:28.640 --> 15:32.800
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit more crimes.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.680
For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate,

15:35.680 --> 15:38.880
but black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.120
And we're talking about a drug that, at this point,

15:41.120 --> 15:45.280
white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.160
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.720
And just look what white people are doing to weed.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.480
Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.000
It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.120
It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.240
Yeah, so, uh, in fact, in the back of the limousine's only the,

16:04.240 --> 16:06.560
one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.560
The whites are at it again.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.160
They have gentrified the marijuana.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.280
And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the

16:13.280 --> 16:17.680
same drug that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.800
A ganjapreneur.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.480
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.720
This is the most basic kind of unfairness.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.720
And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're really ignorant about this, or

16:28.000 --> 16:30.640
you might just not care about black people.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.240
I don't like to assume the worst of people,

16:32.240 --> 16:35.920
but when I look at the state of the conversation about race in America,

16:35.920 --> 16:40.400
I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial executions

16:40.400 --> 16:43.760
of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

16:43.760 --> 16:47.200
and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.840
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person

16:51.840 --> 16:55.520
who takes a stand or takes a knee or speaks up about this in any way.

16:55.520 --> 17:00.320
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,

17:00.320 --> 17:03.840
and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism

17:03.840 --> 17:07.040
and it's unpatriotic and postmodern and racist.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.240
And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.920
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.120
If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,

17:17.120 --> 17:20.240
it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.560
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk about that.

17:24.560 --> 17:29.280
They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.320
How dare they?

17:30.320 --> 17:34.320
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists

17:34.320 --> 17:37.200
or stock salad-eating basic white girl caricatures.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.000
I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.480
where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?

17:42.480 --> 17:46.400
I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.440
And here's the thing about that.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.320
You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,

17:50.320 --> 17:53.440
or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,

17:53.440 --> 17:56.160
is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.280
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.680
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.680
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.720
Please don't do that.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.400
Go succeed as much as possible.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.400
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.160
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,

18:16.160 --> 18:20.320
but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions

18:20.320 --> 18:22.640
that create those circumstances in the first place.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.480
Wow, I feel like I just gave a great speech.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.240
Would you take my speech less seriously

18:28.240 --> 18:31.280
if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime this entire time?

18:31.280 --> 18:32.480
Look, I even put a lime in it.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.840
Bud Light Lime with Lime.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.960
The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much

18:36.960 --> 18:39.200
about people who complain too much about racism.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.320
For the final...

18:41.440 --> 18:42.080
countdown.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.560
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.800
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.080
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.480
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,

18:54.480 --> 18:56.320
and someone should make videos about those too.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.960
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.880
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.400
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.640
Like, come on, that should just be common sense.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.840
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,

19:11.840 --> 19:13.680
smash that unsubscribe button,

19:13.680 --> 19:17.760
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,

19:17.760 --> 19:22.000
and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.600
Um, so, I guess that's it.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.040
I was just kidding about the forest.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.400
I don't fuck with forests.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.840
I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

19:29.840 --> 19:36.080
So I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

19:36.880 --> 19:44.480
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

19:44.480 --> 19:51.920
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.

19:52.640 --> 20:00.400
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword.

20:00.400 --> 20:05.040
His truth is marching on.

20:07.360 --> 20:11.280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.680
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.480
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.760
His truth is marching on.

20:25.200 --> 20:30.160
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea

20:30.160 --> 20:35.280
with the glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.

20:35.280 --> 20:40.480
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free

20:40.480 --> 20:44.160
while God is marching on.

20:44.160 --> 20:49.840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

20:57.840 --> 21:03.840
His truth is marching on.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.840
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.840
Smash the binary hell satan.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
Ow!
