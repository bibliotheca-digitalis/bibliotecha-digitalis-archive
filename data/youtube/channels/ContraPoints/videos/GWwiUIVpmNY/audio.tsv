0	5680	If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.
5680	11280	You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,
11280	15040	and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.
17040	21200	Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,
21200	26640	well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists,
26640	31040	tag team title match tonight at nine, or if you're lucky, you get this.
31040	34560	So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent
34560	38560	black people of crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black
38560	42160	are making bad choices for which they have to deal with the consequences.
42160	46160	Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad that happens to black people. If blacks
46160	49840	are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.
49840	54160	That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide
54160	57520	to commit more crimes for no reason. I guess he's probably gonna blame the rap music.
57520	60320	Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.
60320	64160	I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright
64160	68640	fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the
68640	74240	product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually
74240	78720	this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality,
78720	81920	and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.
82320	84400	They make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.
84400	87280	This is what I'm going to argue against in this video. We're going to take a break
87280	91440	from talking about fascism. In the past I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think
91440	94800	we all have. I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement,
94800	98800	but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.
98800	102080	In this video I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,
102080	105280	which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.
105280	108880	And from now on I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of
108880	114880	pepes and racist odinists and neo-nazi larpers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind
114880	120640	of over it. Oh god damn it. Hallo Leute. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you
120640	126880	anymore. Nein, ich hei√üe nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.
126880	132240	Great. Get out. Well don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.
132240	137360	You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good
137360	142000	question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense. Get out.
142000	147520	She calls me a Nazi and yet she's the one trying to silence my free speech. An excellent example
147520	152320	of how truly fascist the left has become. Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny,
152320	155840	why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas? Well I'm going to discuss
155840	160640	them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life.
160640	165360	Well can we at least talk about the Jewish question? No. It's just ideas. What are you
165360	168880	afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of
168880	175120	here in ten seconds. Ten. Nine. Oh baby, come on. I thought you liked to be. Six. You used to whisper
175120	182640	to me so sweetly. Will not anymore. Well do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax? Okay, Jesus.
185040	188960	I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about disagreements. I don't
188960	194160	enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat but it's these people, they just give you no choice.
194160	197920	Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people about this issue,
197920	201840	they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.
201840	206400	One, by saying you're racist. And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.
206400	210480	And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience
210480	214560	a lot of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,
214560	219760	no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are
219760	224880	more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it,
224880	228960	the left needs to step it up. Now to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on
228960	233520	Twitter to demand they explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole. And it's true,
233520	237840	it's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do with their lives. But I,
237840	241920	on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my lane and
241920	245920	white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,
245920	252960	and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time. Whose job is it to mend
252960	257280	the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a
257280	263280	long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July. This person,
263280	268240	who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this is about.
268240	272560	That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears. Here,
273360	274560	I'll pick you out a cotton ball.
285520	287280	1. Freddie Gray
287280	292720	On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested a
292720	297760	25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that
297760	301520	maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.
302640	308320	When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason,
308320	313680	with three fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of
313680	317840	his spinal injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information
317840	322080	about his arrest. This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the
322080	326480	notorious Baltimore riots. Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism
326480	329520	if black people don't want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from
329520	334240	the police? Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent
334240	338880	crimes shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming
338880	342960	to me how quick you are to defend this. And the other problem is that that's a very superficial
342960	347200	analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have
347200	351680	more poverty, more crime, and are subject to more aggressive policing. So let's delve a little
351680	355840	deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study. Gray had a long arrest record of mostly
355840	360080	drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators brought this out as evidence that he
360080	365840	was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, that he
365840	370080	deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place? I don't think he was
370080	375280	selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just do it for no reason?
375280	379600	Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,
379600	384160	Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated
384240	389200	row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress
389200	394000	banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to
394000	398640	deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead
398640	402960	are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up in the
402960	407920	juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with
407920	413360	a congressional ban on lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have
413360	417600	been added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children
417600	422080	are black. Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for
422080	426560	permanent brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking,
426560	432080	well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's
432080	436960	happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims,
436960	441040	some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their structured monthly
441040	445120	settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.
445120	450080	And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding
450080	457040	bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's
457040	463920	settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray sibling settlement for $54,000. Now,
463920	468720	I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad. But to understand how it relates to structural
468720	473040	racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just
473040	477440	keep doing live streams with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze.
477440	480000	God damn it. I need to relax. I need music.
486800	488720	2. Housing Discrimination
488720	492960	Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead
492960	498160	levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.
498160	504160	Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white. Lead. Race. Lead.
504720	509040	Race. Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.
509040	512480	Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?
512480	514800	I thought racism was over.
514800	519840	Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,
519840	523200	Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,
523280	528560	Oops. Sorry about that. It's all cool now though, right?
528560	533600	No. It's not cool. And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not-cool
533600	537440	things. Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place. I hope I'm not being too
537440	542880	controversial if I propose that, a hundred years ago, America may have been somewhat racist.
542880	548480	In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious
548480	552720	white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city
552720	557920	passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance
557920	562720	forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,
562720	566000	until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.
566000	569920	Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem? Racism can't
569920	572720	exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.
572720	576000	Well, no. That's actually not correct.
576000	580560	In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the
580560	585120	midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed. One of the FHA's purposes was to
585120	589200	establish a reliable credit system backed by the government, which would regulate interest rates
589200	593840	and ensure the terms of mortgages. FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating
593840	597840	homeownership throughout the middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now
597840	602080	remember as the golden age of the American dream. But many black Americans were excluded from
602080	606080	homeownership and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family
606080	609840	financial stability it enabled. So how was this exclusion possible?
609840	614800	Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle
614800	619120	methods to enforce residential segregation and deny homeownership to black Americans.
619120	619920	For instance,
619920	621680	1. Restrictive Covenants
621680	627200	When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,
627200	631600	which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods
631600	635360	to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.
635360	639680	These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued against
639680	643200	owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.
643200	644560	2. Redlining
644560	648960	The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,
648960	652400	which were colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name
652400	657360	redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which,
657360	659200	in turn, left them vulnerable to
659200	660800	3. Predatory Lending
660800	665200	Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed
665200	669440	mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans
669440	672000	with abusive terms, which allowed, for instance,
672000	675360	sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single missed payment.
675360	678960	Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts,
678960	683440	and they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,
683440	686720	further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.
686720	688240	4. Blockbusting
688240	692000	Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,
692000	695680	where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among
695680	699360	residents of a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created
699360	703040	to trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below-market prices,
703040	706320	so they could resell those same houses at extortionate prices
706320	708560	to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.
708560	712400	The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped
712400	717440	in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,
717440	719520	and aggressive, discriminatory policing.
719520	723520	And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains
723520	728080	unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of
728080	732560	homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated
732560	735040	500 million dollars in Chicago alone.
735040	739040	But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed
739040	741760	discrimination of the last century is still ongoing.
741760	744960	I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood,
744960	748000	like one mile away from where Freddie Gray was arrested,
748000	750160	in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.
750160	753040	Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.
753040	756320	Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.
756320	759760	If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is,
759760	764160	and if the city still follows the same pattern of segregation today, and it does,
764160	769600	well, it's almost as if the effects of racism have not entirely been eradicated.
769600	771840	And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.
771840	776720	Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit,
776800	778720	New Orleans, Cleveland, LA.
778720	780960	All these cities are still segregated as shit,
780960	783600	and it's not like a separate-but-equal situation either.
783600	786880	Compare the 2013 population-by-race map of Baltimore
786880	790320	to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015.
790320	792800	That's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing
792800	794800	recorded police stops of black pedestrians.
794800	799760	And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.
799760	803760	Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead
803760	808560	exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems going on here
808560	813440	that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes.
813440	816000	But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either,
816000	818960	because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.
818960	822960	The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,
822960	827840	the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools,
827840	831280	and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of injustice
831280	833520	as if it were simply a problem of criminality.
833520	836400	I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt,
836400	840480	and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?
842400	847680	In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.
847680	851680	You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.
851680	856720	As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra,
857360	860080	Black Lives Matter are the real racists.
860080	864720	3. Mass Incarceration
864720	868880	Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen
868880	872880	to the point where nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.
872880	875360	We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world,
875360	881280	accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.
881280	884160	More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black,
884160	887360	and the black incarceration rate is almost six times that of whites.
887360	891600	Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.
891600	895040	Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison,
895040	897360	too many defendants are pressured into plea bargains,
897360	900960	and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of incarceration.
900960	904240	But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.
904240	907120	Now a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,
907120	910160	if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.
910160	912080	Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.
912080	914240	You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?
914240	915280	Every single YouTuber.
915280	918960	Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.
918960	923040	Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream,
923040	926480	and then we can finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.
926480	927360	God damn it.
927360	928640	Where's my toad venom?
928640	932800	Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit more crimes.
932800	935680	For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate,
935680	938880	but black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it.
938880	941120	And we're talking about a drug that, at this point,
941120	945280	white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.
945280	948160	So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.
948160	950720	And just look what white people are doing to weed.
950720	954480	Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur.
954480	958000	It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.
958000	961120	It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.
961120	964240	Yeah, so, uh, in fact, in the back of the limousine's only the,
964240	966560	one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.
967280	968560	The whites are at it again.
968560	970160	They have gentrified the marijuana.
970160	973280	And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the
973280	977680	same drug that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.
977680	978800	A ganjapreneur.
978800	980480	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
980480	982720	This is the most basic kind of unfairness.
982720	986720	And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're really ignorant about this, or
988000	990640	you might just not care about black people.
990640	992240	I don't like to assume the worst of people,
992240	995920	but when I look at the state of the conversation about race in America,
995920	1000400	I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial executions
1000400	1003760	of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,
1003760	1007200	and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.
1007200	1011840	And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person
1011840	1015520	who takes a stand or takes a knee or speaks up about this in any way.
1015520	1020320	There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,
1020320	1023840	and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism
1023840	1027040	and it's unpatriotic and postmodern and racist.
1027040	1030240	And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.
1030240	1033920	Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.
1033920	1037120	If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,
1037120	1040240	it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.
1040240	1044560	But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk about that.
1044560	1049280	They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest?
1049280	1050320	How dare they?
1050320	1054320	Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists
1054320	1057200	or stock salad-eating basic white girl caricatures.
1057200	1060000	I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think,
1060000	1062480	where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?
1062480	1066400	I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.
1066400	1067440	And here's the thing about that.
1067440	1070320	You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,
1070320	1073440	or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,
1073440	1076160	is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.
1076160	1079280	So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.
1079280	1081680	Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.
1081680	1085680	So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.
1085680	1086720	Please don't do that.
1086720	1088400	Go succeed as much as possible.
1088400	1092400	But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.
1092400	1096160	Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,
1096160	1100320	but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions
1100320	1102640	that create those circumstances in the first place.
1103600	1106480	Wow, I feel like I just gave a great speech.
1106560	1108240	Would you take my speech less seriously
1108240	1111280	if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime this entire time?
1111280	1112480	Look, I even put a lime in it.
1112480	1113840	Bud Light Lime with Lime.
1113840	1116960	The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much
1116960	1119200	about people who complain too much about racism.
1119200	1120320	For the final...
1121440	1122080	countdown.
1122080	1124560	I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.
1124560	1128800	First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.
1128800	1132080	I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.
1132080	1134480	But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,
1134480	1136320	and someone should make videos about those too.
1136320	1138960	Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.
1138960	1142880	I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.
1142880	1146400	Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.
1146400	1148640	Like, come on, that should just be common sense.
1148640	1151840	So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,
1151840	1153680	smash that unsubscribe button,
1153680	1157760	unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,
1157760	1162000	and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.
1162000	1165600	Um, so, I guess that's it.
1165600	1167040	I was just kidding about the forest.
1167040	1168400	I don't fuck with forests.
1168400	1169840	I'm really more of an indoor tranny.
1169840	1176080	So I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.
1176880	1184480	Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
1184480	1191920	He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
1192640	1200400	He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword.
1200400	1205040	His truth is marching on.
1207360	1211280	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1212000	1215680	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1216400	1220480	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1220480	1223760	His truth is marching on.
1225200	1230160	In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea
1230160	1235280	with the glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.
1235280	1240480	As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
1240480	1244160	while God is marching on.
1244160	1249840	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1249840	1253840	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1253840	1257840	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
1257840	1263840	His truth is marching on.
1263840	1265840	Death to capitalism and the patriarchy.
1265840	1267840	Smash the binary hell satan.
1267840	1269840	Ow!
