1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,280
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,200
Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,640
well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience, racist debate fascists,

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,040
tag team title match tonight at nine, or if you're lucky, you get this.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,560
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,560
black people of crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,160
are making bad choices for which they have to deal with the consequences.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad that happens to black people. If blacks

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
are getting shot and going to jail more, it's their fault for committing crimes.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
That's right, racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
to commit more crimes for no reason. I guess he's probably gonna blame the rap music.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,160
I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,640
fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,240
product not of injustice, but of black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
this idea gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality,

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,920
and dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
They make me uncomfortable and I don't like it.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
This is what I'm going to argue against in this video. We're going to take a break

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,440
from talking about fascism. In the past I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,800
we all have. I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely is a dangerous movement,

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that exists in America.

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,080
In this video I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,280
which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880
And from now on I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,880
pepes and racist odinists and neo-nazi larpers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,640
of over it. Oh god damn it. Hallo Leute. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,880
anymore. Nein, ich heiÃŸe nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,240
Great. Get out. Well don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,360
You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense. Get out.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
She calls me a Nazi and yet she's the one trying to silence my free speech. An excellent example

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,320
of how truly fascist the left has become. Look, if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny,

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,840
why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas? Well I'm going to discuss

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,360
Well can we at least talk about the Jewish question? No. It's just ideas. What are you

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,880
afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the tabby whistle if you don't get out of

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,120
here in ten seconds. Ten. Nine. Oh baby, come on. I thought you liked to be. Six. You used to whisper

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,640
to me so sweetly. Will not anymore. Well do you at least want to buy some Vitalimax? Okay, Jesus.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,960
I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about disagreements. I don't

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,160
enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat but it's these people, they just give you no choice.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,920
Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people about this issue,

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,840
they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
One, by saying you're racist. And two, by saying it's not my job to educate you.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
And I'm sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
a lot of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,760
no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,880
more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it,

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,960
the left needs to step it up. Now to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,520
Twitter to demand they explain racism to you, you're being kind of an asshole. And it's true,

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,840
it's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do with their lives. But I,

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out of my lane and

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,960
and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time. Whose job is it to mend

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,280
the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things that happened a

58
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,280
long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I did before July. This person,

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,240
who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this is about.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears. Here,

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
I'll pick you out a cotton ball.

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
1. Freddie Gray

63
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,720
On April 12, 2015, three police officers near a housing project in West Baltimore arrested a

64
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,760
25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,520
maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van.

66
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,320
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason,

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,680
with three fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
his spinal injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
about his arrest. This led to widespread protests all over the city, eventually culminating in the

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,480
notorious Baltimore riots. Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism

71
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,520
if black people don't want to be killed and they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,240
the police? Well, the first problem with that is that extrajudicial executions for nonviolent

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,880
crimes shouldn't really be a common thing in a civilized democracy, and it's a little alarming

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960
to me how quick you are to defend this. And the other problem is that that's a very superficial

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,200
analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,680
more poverty, more crime, and are subject to more aggressive policing. So let's delve a little

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study. Gray had a long arrest record of mostly

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,080
drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators brought this out as evidence that he

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,840
was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got what was coming to him, that he

80
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the first place? I don't think he was

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,280
selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just do it for no reason?

82
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in a dilapidated

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,200
row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint until Congress

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,000
banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children, leading to

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,640
deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned with lead

87
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,960
are seven times more likely to drop out of school and six times more likely to end up in the

88
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,920
juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,360
a congressional ban on lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have

90
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,600
been added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,080
are black. Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,560
permanent brain damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking,

93
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
well, reparations were paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,960
happened is a sub-industry has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims,

95
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,040
some of whom can't even read a contract, and offer to buy out their structured monthly

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,120
settlements in exchange for a lump sum that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement.

97
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,080
And that's exactly what happened to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding

98
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,040
bought the $146,000 remainder of his settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's

99
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,920
settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000 Gray sibling settlement for $54,000. Now,

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,720
I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad. But to understand how it relates to structural

101
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,040
racism, we have to look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,440
keep doing live streams with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze.

103
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
God damn it. I need to relax. I need music.

104
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
2. Housing Discrimination

105
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead

106
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,160
levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Yellow dots standing for black residents, and blue dots standing for white. Lead. Race. Lead.

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Race. Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,480
Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?

110
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,800
I thought racism was over.

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,840
Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,

112
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,200
Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,

113
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,560
Oops. Sorry about that. It's all cool now though, right?

114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,600
No. It's not cool. And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not-cool

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,440
things. Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place. I hope I'm not being too

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
controversial if I propose that, a hundred years ago, America may have been somewhat racist.

117
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,480
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

118
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city

119
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,920
passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance

120
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,720
forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,

121
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem? Racism can't

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

124
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, no. That's actually not correct.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,560
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the

126
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,120
midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed. One of the FHA's purposes was to

127
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
establish a reliable credit system backed by the government, which would regulate interest rates

128
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,840
and ensure the terms of mortgages. FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,840
homeownership throughout the middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now

130
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,080
remember as the golden age of the American dream. But many black Americans were excluded from

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
homeownership and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family

132
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,840
financial stability it enabled. So how was this exclusion possible?

133
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Well, basically, the FHA, city governments, and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120
methods to enforce residential segregation and deny homeownership to black Americans.

135
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
For instance,

136
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
1. Restrictive Covenants

137
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,200
When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official Committee on Segregation,

138
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure landlords in white neighborhoods

139
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
to sign covenants committing them never to sell or rent to black residents.

140
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health code citations issued against

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the covenant.

142
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
2. Redlining

143
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,960
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods,

144
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,400
which were colored in red on official maps, giving the practice the name

145
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,360
redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to government-backed mortgages, which,

146
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
in turn, left them vulnerable to

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
3. Predatory Lending

148
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed

149
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
mortgages, exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly priced installment plans

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
with abusive terms, which allowed, for instance,

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
sellers to repossess and resell homes after a single missed payment.

152
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Many black residents had no choice but to buy into these exploitative contracts,

153
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,440
and they often resorted to subdividing houses or neglecting repairs in order to make payments,

154
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
further contributing to the overcrowding and decay of black neighborhoods.

155
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
4. Blockbusting

156
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,680
where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
residents of a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created

159
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
to trick white homeowners into selling their houses at below-market prices,

160
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
so they could resell those same houses at extortionate prices

161
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,560
to black families desperate to escape the ghetto.

162
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,400
The long-term effect of these practices was that many black families ended up trapped

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,440
in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools, little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty,

164
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,520
and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

165
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,520
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended, the injustice remains

166
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,080
unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were effectively robbed of

167
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,560
homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost black families an estimated

168
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
500 million dollars in Chicago alone.

169
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
But worst of all is that segregation and ghettoization caused by government-backed

170
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
discrimination of the last century is still ongoing.

171
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood,

172
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,000
like one mile away from where Freddie Gray was arrested,

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.

174
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,040
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore.

175
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

176
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is,

177
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
and if the city still follows the same pattern of segregation today, and it does,

178
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,600
well, it's almost as if the effects of racism have not entirely been eradicated.

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

180
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,720
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit,

181
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
New Orleans, Cleveland, LA.

182
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,960
All these cities are still segregated as shit,

183
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,600
and it's not like a separate-but-equal situation either.

184
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
Compare the 2013 population-by-race map of Baltimore

185
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015.

186
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
That's black neighborhoods in red and green dots representing

187
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
recorded police stops of black pedestrians.

188
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,760
And finally, let's bring back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013.

189
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Now consider this information in combination with some scientific studies linking lead

190
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,560
exposure and violent crime, and it almost starts to look like there's some problems going on here

191
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,440
that might not be solved simply by telling black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes.

192
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
But I don't want to overstate the lead crime theory either,

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,960
because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.

194
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,960
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,

195
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,840
the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost opportunities, the bad schools,

196
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,280
and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of injustice

197
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,520
as if it were simply a problem of criminality.

198
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,400
I know I said my interest in this topic isn't a matter of white guilt,

199
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,480
and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

200
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,680
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt.

201
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,680
You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did.

202
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra,

203
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Black Lives Matter are the real racists.

204
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,720
3. Mass Incarceration

205
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,880
Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen

206
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,880
to the point where nearly 1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison.

207
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
We now have the highest incarceration rate in the world,

208
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,280
accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's population.

209
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,160
More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black,

210
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
and the black incarceration rate is almost six times that of whites.

211
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,600
Now without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.

212
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison,

213
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
too many defendants are pressured into plea bargains,

214
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,960
and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of incarceration.

215
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,240
But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

216
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
Now a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

217
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

218
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,080
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

219
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,240
You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer?

220
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,280
Every single YouTuber.

221
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,960
Free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda.

222
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,040
Let's get him all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream,

223
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
and then we can finally give the Jewish question the platform it deserves.

224
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,360
God damn it.

225
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,640
Where's my toad venom?

226
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit more crimes.

227
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,680
For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate,

228
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
but black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it.

229
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
And we're talking about a drug that, at this point,

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,280
white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

231
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,160
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry.

232
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,720
And just look what white people are doing to weed.

233
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur.

234
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a strong, strong sativa, very high in limonene.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,120
It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

236
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
Yeah, so, uh, in fact, in the back of the limousine's only the,

237
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,560
one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.

238
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,560
The whites are at it again.

239
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
They have gentrified the marijuana.

240
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,280
And now we've got white business people making millions of dollars selling the

241
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,680
same drug that black people are still disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

242
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
A ganjapreneur.

243
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,480
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

244
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
This is the most basic kind of unfairness.

245
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're really ignorant about this, or

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,640
you might just not care about black people.

247
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,240
I don't like to assume the worst of people,

248
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
but when I look at the state of the conversation about race in America,

249
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,400
I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial executions

250
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,760
of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

251
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,200
and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,840
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person

253
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,520
who takes a stand or takes a knee or speaks up about this in any way.

254
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,320
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,

255
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,840
and how its identity politics equivalent to white nationalism

256
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,040
and it's unpatriotic and postmodern and racist.

257
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,240
And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

258
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,920
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's nightmare.

259
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,120
If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,

260
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,240
it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

261
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,560
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to talk about that.

262
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,280
They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest?

263
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
How dare they?

264
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists

265
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
or stock salad-eating basic white girl caricatures.

266
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,000
I imagine some black people will probably watch this video and think,

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim?

268
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
I take responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

269
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,440
And here's the thing about that.

270
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,320
You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,

271
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,440
or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,

272
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,160
is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

273
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,280
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

274
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,680
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,680
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallow in victimhood.

276
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
Please don't do that.

277
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,400
Go succeed as much as possible.

278
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

279
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,160
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,

280
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions

281
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,640
that create those circumstances in the first place.

282
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
Wow, I feel like I just gave a great speech.

283
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
Would you take my speech less seriously

284
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,280
if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light Lime this entire time?

285
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,480
Look, I even put a lime in it.

286
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
Bud Light Lime with Lime.

287
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,960
The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain too much

288
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
about people who complain too much about racism.

289
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
For the final...

290
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,080
countdown.

291
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,560
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

292
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,800
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.

293
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,080
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

294
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,

295
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
and someone should make videos about those too.

296
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

297
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,880
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.

298
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

299
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
Like, come on, that should just be common sense.

300
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,840
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,

301
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,680
smash that unsubscribe button,

302
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,760
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,

303
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,000
and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.

304
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Um, so, I guess that's it.

305
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,040
I was just kidding about the forest.

306
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,400
I don't fuck with forests.

307
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

308
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,080
So I guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

309
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,480
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

310
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,920
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.

311
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,400
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword.

312
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,040
His truth is marching on.

313
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

314
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,680
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

315
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,480
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

316
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,760
His truth is marching on.

317
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,160
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea

318
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,280
with the glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.

319
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,480
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free

320
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,160
while God is marching on.

321
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

322
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

323
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

324
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
His truth is marching on.

325
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy.

326
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
Smash the binary hell satan.

327
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Ow!
