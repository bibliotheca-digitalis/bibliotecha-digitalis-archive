0	5000	9-1-1, what are you reporting?
5000	8000	Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.
8000	11000	Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...
11000	16000	I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six foot tall, big man hands.
16000	20000	I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man hands?
20000	23000	Well, she's covered in butterflies, and she has giant wings.
23000	25000	I'm sorry, what?
25000	27000	Oh, and she talks like a fat s**t.
27000	28000	Ma'am.
30000	33000	Out of this wood do not desire to go.
33000	37000	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
37000	44000	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
58000	66000	Hail, mortals! I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.
66000	70000	Western culture is being destroyed. By cucks.
70000	73000	And by gender-bending, intoxication, and sodomy.
73000	76000	You know, things that have never happened in Europe.
76000	92000	There's a lot of people talking lately about the West, and Western culture, and Western civilization.
92000	94000	But what do those words even mean?
94000	100000	I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.
100000	101000	F**k that!
101000	104000	People demand blood, and I'm thirsty for blood.
104000	106000	And by blood, I mean dick.
106000	108000	And by dick, I mean corndogs.
108000	112000	And by corndogs, I mean 16 of them over the course of an evening.
112000	114000	And by evening, I mean morning.
114000	117000	And by morning, I mean between 8 o'clock and 8.15.
117000	119000	And by corndogs, I mean dick.
119000	121000	Who's up first?
121000	125000	Well, angry white guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,
125000	127000	and it's been a while since I've done a video response,
127000	130000	so let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.
130000	132000	Macaulay Culkin is here, baby doll.
133000	134000	What?
136000	138000	I don't want to die!
141000	145000	That is a man!
145000	149000	Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.
149000	155000	The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.
155000	158000	Both of these clues have to do with coming out.
158000	159000	Wrong!
159000	162000	Her magic power is the conflict of the plot,
162000	168000	and her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential
168000	171000	and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.
171000	176000	She will destroy her enemies and raise their castles to the ground.
176000	180000	The song Let It Go is basically, fuck this shit, I'm conquering everyone!
180000	187000	So just to be clear, this is a grown man who has dressed himself in the garb of a sorcerer
187000	191000	to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.
191000	193000	It almost feels like punching down at this point.
193000	195000	At least the golden one was mask for mask.
195000	197000	Who can I punch up at?
197000	198000	Blech.
198000	199000	I don't like talking about punching.
199000	202000	It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.
202000	204000	I would never punch a turf.
204000	206000	My hands are too feminine.
206000	208000	And my fingers are tired.
208000	210000	Someone massage them.
210000	212000	Who can I claw up at?
212000	216000	The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid!
216000	218000	How about that?
218000	220000	Dad, stop, ugh, get out of my life.
220000	225000	In my video about Jordan Peterson I talked about how he posits a struggle between the West
225000	227000	and postmodern neo-Marxism.
227000	233000	I argued that Pomo No Mo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,
233000	235000	none of which are in any sense non-Western.
235000	240000	Unless of course you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,
240000	244000	which surely no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?
245000	247000	I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.
247000	251000	In this video I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West
251000	253000	and the people who claim to defend it.
254000	257000	Wow, Daddy, nice... sword.
257000	259000	Goddammit, we're gonna need to aim even higher.
259000	262000	Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...
264000	267000	the President of the United States of America,
267000	270000	Big Dick Special Big Boy Donald Trump.
270000	275000	Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that
275000	279000	the West will never, ever be broken.
279000	284000	Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,
284000	287000	and our civilization will triumph.
287000	300000	So we've got the most powerful fuck-boy on the planet
300000	303000	prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization,
303000	307000	so I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.
307000	310000	Which is too bad, because that's gonna require a lot of thinking.
310000	313000	And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.
313000	315000	Someone massage it.
317000	323000	And soon, mechanically, dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,
323000	329000	I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.
329000	333000	No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate
333000	336000	than a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,
336000	339000	intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.
339000	342000	An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,
342000	347000	something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.
347000	351000	And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,
351000	355000	its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,
355000	359000	this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has,
359000	362000	a post-preambulatory banter.
362000	366000	Whether you're in fashy YouTube or pomo, nomo, akadomino,
366000	369000	it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,
369000	372000	clearly defined thing called Western Civilization
372000	378000	that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings.
381000	387000	But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people for particular purposes.
387000	389000	It's like an origin myth.
389000	392000	In an article titled, There is no such thing as Western Civilization,
392000	398000	the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
398000	400000	there was no such thing as the West.
400000	405000	The world was divided into three continents he called Europe, Asia, and Libya.
405000	410000	Herodotus had no notion that these three continents corresponded to different types of people,
410000	413000	and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.
413000	417000	In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia, in which he traveled,
417000	420000	than with the faraway and foreign people of Northern Europe.
420000	423000	So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.
424000	426000	Really, there is no one idea of the West,
426000	431000	which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.
431000	436000	According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked under the heading of the West.
436000	438000	Let's talk about them now!
438000	441000	Concept 1. Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values
441000	448000	In the year 732, a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory at the Battle of Tours
448000	452000	against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain into what is now France,
452000	456000	effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into Western Europe.
456000	462000	According to Appiah, the first recorded use of the Latin term Europensis, or Europeans,
462000	468000	dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tours, distinguishing Christians from Muslims.
468000	471000	In the late Middle Ages, the concept of Christendom appeared,
471000	476000	and was used to distinguish the Christian world from the Islamic world, and from paganism.
476000	482000	This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor to the modern concept of the West.
482000	486000	Notice that the term itself posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,
486000	489000	where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.
489000	493000	The Christian inheritance is still invoked today by defenders of the West
493000	497000	like Lil Benny and Professor Studied the Blade, often under the heading of
497000	500000	Judeo-Christian Values,
500000	504000	a term usually used to falsely imply that contemporary moral norms
504000	509000	derive from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,
509000	512000	as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,
512000	517000	as if the prohibition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever,
517000	523000	as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily-triggered ego
523000	525000	and non-condemning slavery and rape.
525000	528000	And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?
528000	529000	Bible jokes!
529000	534000	Another main use of Judeo-Christian Values is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.
534000	539000	Speaking of which, what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?
539000	542000	Two kids and a dog just like the Bible says?
542000	544000	Well, no.
544000	549000	Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament and not forbidden in either testament.
549000	554000	Even in the beginning, Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents, and who can blame her,
554000	557000	and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.
557000	559000	But it's cool, he was into that.
559000	564000	In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church gradually enforced the one-man-and-one-woman view of marriage,
564000	568000	although in formerly pagan lands this idea was slow to take hold.
568000	574000	Charles Martel's grandson Charlemagne had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines
574000	579000	because he was a proud son of the North, 100% natty, and alpha as fuck.
579000	581000	I'm sorry, I just can't stop.
581000	585000	The Golden One, his soul and mine are intermingled.
585000	590000	Probably because we both played 1200 Hours of Age of Empires in 1999.
590000	592000	And then something went terribly wrong.
592000	594000	Fuckin' 9-11.
594000	598000	It used to be such an innocent decision, choosing to play as the Franks or the Saracens,
598000	604000	then it became this huge civilizational struggle, and that's why this guy is a fascist and I grew up to be a woman.
604000	606000	Thanks a lot, Osama.
606000	608000	Ugh, being transgender is so weird.
608000	613000	Like, you have these childhood memories that are just totally discordant with your adult gender identity,
613000	615000	like, how do you even deal with that?
615000	616000	Well, here's how.
616000	621000	You bond with straight guys over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia, and then you fuck them.
621000	625000	I'm not like other girls.
630000	632000	Concept two, enlightenment values.
632000	636000	So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther
636000	640000	nails his list of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.
640000	645000	That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence between Catholics and Protestants.
645000	650000	That eventually chills out, but then the 18th century rolls around and shit's just fuckin' crazy.
650000	655000	There are various fops and dandies and macaronis getting wired out of their heads at coffeehouses
655000	658000	and babbling about enlightenment like the beatnik trash they are.
658000	665000	Then, 300 years later, a bunch of drink-sodden fedora-tippers appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire
665000	669000	before sinking into sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug
669000	675000	and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.
675000	678000	That's not what they were discussing at the Parisian Salon.
678000	682000	This is all very embarrassing, but still, some of these enlightenment values—
682000	686000	science, liberty, skepticism about dogma—
686000	691000	these are basically good ideas, and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.
691000	695000	But it's important to keep in mind that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.
695000	698000	In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.
698000	703000	So the sum of what we now think of as the West actually contains major contradictions,
703000	707000	because the history of the West is a history of change and revolution.
707000	711000	So when a new movement comes along, like for instance a bunch of buzzkill sad-sacks
711000	715000	pointing out that actually our society is still pretty terrible to women,
715000	718000	people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,
718000	721000	it might not be the smartest thing to just dismiss it
721000	724000	as some kind of sinister postmodern neo-Marxist cuckoldry.
724000	729000	It could be the next Reformation, in a history marked by a series of Reformations.
729000	734000	If there are any historians watching this, please call it the SJW Reformation.
734000	736000	Think about the Protestant Reformation.
736000	741000	At the time, that probably seemed like a civilizational threat to the Holy Roman Empire,
741000	742000	and it kinda was.
742000	747000	But in retrospect, we see the Reformation as just as important a moment in Western culture
747000	750000	as the medieval period that preceded it.
750000	755000	But today's counter-Reformation, made up of people like Orangey Smalls and Dr. Clean-Your-Room,
755000	760000	uh, insist on pretending the current Reformation is some kind of alien threat.
760000	765000	And as for the counter-counter-Reformation, well, that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.
765000	768000	Concept 3. Western Culture
768000	773000	The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism between the Western Roman Catholic Church
773000	775000	and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
775000	780000	But in its contemporary sense, the idea of a Western culture didn't really exist
780000	784000	until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
784000	790000	when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spengler's 1918 book The Decline of the West,
790000	793000	an important influence on Nazi ideology.
793000	796000	As long as people have been talking about Western culture,
796000	799000	they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,
799000	804000	as I've discussed in several earlier videos which I encourage you not to watch.
804000	808000	But the idea of Western culture was influential well beyond the Third Reich.
808000	813000	At the height of European imperialism, the idea of a superior high culture of the West
813000	818000	was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit the mysterious Orient.
818000	822000	And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist rhetoric under the rug,
822000	827000	the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept in our schools and universities,
827000	832000	where you have to take courses like History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,
832000	834000	which you didn't actually do any of the readings for
834000	838000	because you were too busy crouching in the bushes outside the dean's office
838000	840000	vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.
840000	845000	The consequence of this Western culture education is that we now all have this sense
845000	849000	that we belong to a continuous civilization whose crowning achievements are
849000	855000	the Ten Commandments, Jesus fucking Christ, Athenian pederasts, cathedrals, Mozart,
855000	858000	human rights, science, and iPhones.
858000	862000	But the reality is, this is an essentialist conglomeration of a history
862000	864000	that's much more nonlinear than we often think.
864000	869000	We in the West claim to be the inheritors of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,
869000	872000	but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.
872000	876000	St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,
876000	880000	is largely responsible for introducing Aristotle to Christian universities,
880000	883000	but he never would have encountered Aristotle in the first place
883000	886000	while ancient Greek philosophy had been translated and commentated
886000	888000	by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.
888000	892000	So the origins of Western culture aren't really unique to us at all.
892000	895000	And the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.
895000	898000	On the one hand you have Judeo-Christian values,
898000	901000	and on the other hand you have degenerates like William Shakespeare,
901000	905000	who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens and make out with each other.
905000	910000	Which, for the record, is disgusting, and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.
910000	914000	Because if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times, boys in drag played female parts.
914000	916000	I wish I had female parts.
916000	918000	Working on it.
918000	920000	Concept four, the free world.
920000	925000	From 1941 to 1945, Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,
925000	929000	an agricultural scientist from Iowa whom Democratic Party officials despised
929000	932000	for being what we'd now call a Democratic Socialist.
932000	936000	Wallace later ran for president in 1948 as a third-party candidate
936000	941000	on a platform of universal healthcare, anti-segregation, and opposition to the Cold War.
941000	945000	During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked in the press for his spiritualism,
945000	948000	his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,
948000	952000	and what Time Magazine called his assault on the South,
952000	956000	that is, his quote, ostentatious ride through cities and towns
956000	961000	with his Negro secretary beside him, for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.
961000	963000	The poor, naive Wallace commented,
963000	968000	there is something so unlovely about hate when you see it distorting the human face.
968000	971000	We'll get used to it, buddy. This is America.
971000	975000	Am I lecturing someone from 1948 about how bigoted this country is?
975000	977000	This is fine.
977000	981000	Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote in the 1948 election,
981000	985000	and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech titled
985000	987000	The Century of the Common Man,
987000	992000	in which he contrasted what he called the slave world of fascists with the free world,
992000	997000	which he described as an incomplete and ongoing international people's revolution.
997000	1001000	No Nazi counter-revolution will stop him.
1001000	1006000	The common man will smoke the Hitler stooges out into the open in the United States,
1006000	1009000	in Latin America, and in India.
1009000	1012000	He will destroy their influence.
1012000	1018000	No Lavals, no Mussolinis will be tolerated in a free world.
1018000	1022000	Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it, but it was common during World War II,
1022000	1026000	when the phrase the free world first entered common parlance,
1026000	1031000	to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers, including the Dirty Reds.
1031000	1036000	After the war, the phrase the free world remained common in American politics,
1036000	1038000	but the meaning shifted.
1038000	1041000	Instead of referring to the International Alliance Against Fascism,
1041000	1046000	it referred to the capitalist West, as opposed to the communist East.
1046000	1050000	The idea of the free capitalist West is still an important ingredient
1050000	1053000	in this jumbled concept we call Western civilization.
1053000	1057000	So when Lobster Dad says there's a struggle between Marxism and the West,
1057000	1061000	it seems at first like he's just stuck in the 1980s or something.
1061000	1064000	Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?
1064000	1066000	Dad! What year do you think it is?
1066000	1069000	Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?
1069000	1071000	They're on your side now, remember?
1071000	1074000	The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism
1074000	1079000	to invoke Red Scare sentiment in opposition to the SJW Reformation.
1079000	1082000	But the point I'm trying to make is that the West is a concept,
1082000	1084000	or rather several contradictory concepts,
1084000	1088000	that are always posited in particular political circumstances
1088000	1091000	as one side of an us-versus-them opposition,
1091000	1093000	whether it's the Christian West versus the infidels,
1093000	1096000	the Enlightenment West versus Islam,
1096000	1099000	the cultured West versus the colonized savages,
1099000	1102000	the capitalist West versus the communist East,
1102000	1106000	or the white European West versus the Jewish-cultural Marxist plot
1106000	1110000	to cock the sons of the North by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens
1110000	1114000	and inundating their countries with a barbarous horde of third-world migrants.
1114000	1116000	I guess I have to say something about that.
1116000	1119000	Concept five, blood and soil.
1119000	1123000	If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer Richard Spencer
1123000	1125000	what he thinks the West is,
1125000	1129000	he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic, and genetic inheritance
1129000	1133000	bequeathed to European people by their fair-skinned ancestors.
1133000	1137000	To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent
1137000	1139000	could be part of the West is ridiculous
1139000	1143000	because, for Spencer, to be Western is to be white.
1143000	1144000	Now the thing about that is,
1144000	1147000	as an analysis of the common usage of the term the West,
1147000	1149000	it's not even wrong.
1149000	1152000	Consider Latin America, where the main languages spoken
1152000	1154000	are Spanish, Portuguese, and French,
1154000	1157000	where the majority religion is Roman Catholicism.
1157000	1160000	Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the West?
1160000	1164000	Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?
1164000	1167000	Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.
1167000	1169000	Or to be more accurate,
1169000	1173000	the flexible and historically variant concepts of whiteness and the West
1173000	1176000	have been constructed so as to exclude them.
1176000	1178000	And I've already spent half my YouTube career
1178000	1180000	on delirious gay screeching about Nazis,
1180000	1182000	so I don't want to do more of that now.
1182000	1185000	But suffice to say, the association between whiteness and the West
1185000	1188000	is always lurking beneath the surface,
1188000	1190000	and when whiteness rears its head proudly,
1190000	1194000	the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.
1194000	1195000	As I'm making this video,
1195000	1198000	the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes
1198000	1200000	is up and running yet again,
1200000	1202000	thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe
1202000	1204000	and a racist demagogue in the United States.
1204000	1208000	And once more, both continents are dotted with barbed wire,
1208000	1213000	refugee ghettos, and internment camps full of children torn from parents.
1217000	1221000	The West, in many ways, is an inherently supremacist concept.
1221000	1226000	It's thought to be more civilized, more holy, and more cultured than the non-West.
1226000	1228000	But there are some ridiculous college professors
1228000	1232000	who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.
1232000	1235000	According to them, the West is not uniquely civilized,
1235000	1240000	but uniquely uncivilized, cruel, imperialistic, racist, and genocidal.
1240000	1244000	But this just perpetuates the same essentializing error.
1244000	1246000	Europeans aren't inherently more evil
1246000	1248000	any more than they're inherently more civilized.
1248000	1252000	If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa 400 years ago,
1252000	1254000	the result would have been just as brutal.
1254000	1256000	So instead of vilifying the West,
1256000	1259000	I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,
1259000	1262000	adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,
1262000	1265000	and acknowledge that the world is too complicated to reduce
1265000	1267000	to simple us-and-them binaries.
1267000	1270000	Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle
1270000	1272000	and classical music and the cheesecake factory.
1272000	1274000	We can still keep all that shit,
1274000	1278000	while eliminating the propaganda and injustice that surrounds it.
1282000	1285000	My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.
1285000	1287000	What if traps are gay?
1287000	1289000	What if no one can ever love you?
1289000	1291000	What if happiness is impossible?
1291000	1293000	What if everyone who compliments me is lying,
1293000	1297000	so they can laugh at me later when I delusionally feel good about myself?
1297000	1300000	What if when you die you stay conscious and then you just are un-
1300000	1303000	What if I'm standing in an awkward way and it looks weird?
1303000	1305000	What if Blanchard is right?
1305000	1308000	What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?
1308000	1310000	Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain,
1310000	1312000	and music is really great for that.
1312000	1314000	I've always liked classical music.
1314000	1318000	When I listen to Mozart or Mendelssohn or even an amateur like Satie,
1318000	1320000	my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.
1320000	1323000	And I don't care what civilization the composer came from,
1323000	1325000	or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.
1325000	1328000	And I don't want to know, because I need this.
1328000	1332000	I need this feeling that makes me just want to take a big-
1334000	1335000	inside of my balls.
1340000	1342000	I could've fit two at once.
1342000	1345000	So, okay, fine, he has the head of an ass,
1345000	1348000	but there's certain advantages to that, that's all I'm saying.
1402000	1403000	Mmm.
1410000	1412000	I don't know.
