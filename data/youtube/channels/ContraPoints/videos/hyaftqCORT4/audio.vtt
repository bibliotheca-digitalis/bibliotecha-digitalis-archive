WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
9-1-1, what are you reporting?

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six foot tall, big man hands.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man hands?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Well, she's covered in butterflies, and she has giant wings.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
I'm sorry, what?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Oh, and she talks like a fat s**t.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Ma'am.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Hail, mortals! I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Western culture is being destroyed. By cucks.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And by gender-bending, intoxication, and sodomy.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
You know, things that have never happened in Europe.

01:16.000 --> 01:32.000
There's a lot of people talking lately about the West, and Western culture, and Western civilization.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
But what do those words even mean?

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
F**k that!

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
People demand blood, and I'm thirsty for blood.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And by blood, I mean dick.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And by dick, I mean corndogs.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And by corndogs, I mean 16 of them over the course of an evening.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
And by evening, I mean morning.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And by morning, I mean between 8 o'clock and 8.15.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And by corndogs, I mean dick.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Who's up first?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Well, angry white guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and it's been a while since I've done a video response,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
so let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Macaulay Culkin is here, baby doll.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
What?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I don't want to die!

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
That is a man!

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Both of these clues have to do with coming out.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Wrong!

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Her magic power is the conflict of the plot,

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
and her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
and her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
She will destroy her enemies and raise their castles to the ground.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
The song Let It Go is basically, fuck this shit, I'm conquering everyone!

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
So just to be clear, this is a grown man who has dressed himself in the garb of a sorcerer

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It almost feels like punching down at this point.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
At least the golden one was mask for mask.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Who can I punch up at?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Blech.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't like talking about punching.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I would never punch a turf.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
My hands are too feminine.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And my fingers are tired.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Someone massage them.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Who can I claw up at?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid!

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
How about that?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Dad, stop, ugh, get out of my life.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
In my video about Jordan Peterson I talked about how he posits a struggle between the West

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and postmodern neo-Marxism.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
I argued that Pomo No Mo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
none of which are in any sense non-Western.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Unless of course you equate the West with white people and Marxism with the Jews,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
which surely no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
In this video I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
and the people who claim to defend it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Wow, Daddy, nice... sword.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Goddammit, we're gonna need to aim even higher.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
the President of the United States of America,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Big Dick Special Big Boy Donald Trump.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
the West will never, ever be broken.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and our civilization will triumph.

04:47.000 --> 05:00.000
So we've got the most powerful fuck-boy on the planet

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
so I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Which is too bad, because that's gonna require a lot of thinking.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Someone massage it.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
And soon, mechanically, dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
than a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
a post-preambulatory banter.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Whether you're in fashy YouTube or pomo, nomo, akadomino,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
clearly defined thing called Western Civilization

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people for particular purposes.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It's like an origin myth.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
In an article titled, There is no such thing as Western Civilization,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
there was no such thing as the West.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
The world was divided into three continents he called Europe, Asia, and Libya.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Herodotus had no notion that these three continents corresponded to different types of people,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia, in which he traveled,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
than with the faraway and foreign people of Northern Europe.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Really, there is no one idea of the West,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked under the heading of the West.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Let's talk about them now!

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Concept 1. Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
In the year 732, a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory at the Battle of Tours

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain into what is now France,

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into Western Europe.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
According to Appiah, the first recorded use of the Latin term Europensis, or Europeans,

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tours, distinguishing Christians from Muslims.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
In the late Middle Ages, the concept of Christendom appeared,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
and was used to distinguish the Christian world from the Islamic world, and from paganism.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor to the modern concept of the West.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Notice that the term itself posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
The Christian inheritance is still invoked today by defenders of the West

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
like Lil Benny and Professor Studied the Blade, often under the heading of

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Judeo-Christian Values,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
a term usually used to falsely imply that contemporary moral norms

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
derive from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
as if the prohibition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever,

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws protecting snowflake Yahweh's easily-triggered ego

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
and non-condemning slavery and rape.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Bible jokes!

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Another main use of Judeo-Christian Values is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Speaking of which, what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Two kids and a dog just like the Bible says?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Well, no.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament and not forbidden in either testament.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Even in the beginning, Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents, and who can blame her,

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
But it's cool, he was into that.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church gradually enforced the one-man-and-one-woman view of marriage,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
although in formerly pagan lands this idea was slow to take hold.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Charles Martel's grandson Charlemagne had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
because he was a proud son of the North, 100% natty, and alpha as fuck.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm sorry, I just can't stop.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
The Golden One, his soul and mine are intermingled.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Probably because we both played 1200 Hours of Age of Empires in 1999.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And then something went terribly wrong.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Fuckin' 9-11.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
It used to be such an innocent decision, choosing to play as the Franks or the Saracens,

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
then it became this huge civilizational struggle, and that's why this guy is a fascist and I grew up to be a woman.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Thanks a lot, Osama.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Ugh, being transgender is so weird.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Like, you have these childhood memories that are just totally discordant with your adult gender identity,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
like, how do you even deal with that?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Well, here's how.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
You bond with straight guys over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia, and then you fuck them.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm not like other girls.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Concept two, enlightenment values.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
nails his list of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence between Catholics and Protestants.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
That eventually chills out, but then the 18th century rolls around and shit's just fuckin' crazy.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
There are various fops and dandies and macaronis getting wired out of their heads at coffeehouses

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
and babbling about enlightenment like the beatnik trash they are.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Then, 300 years later, a bunch of drink-sodden fedora-tippers appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
before sinking into sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
That's not what they were discussing at the Parisian Salon.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
This is all very embarrassing, but still, some of these enlightenment values—

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
science, liberty, skepticism about dogma—

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
these are basically good ideas, and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
But it's important to keep in mind that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
So the sum of what we now think of as the West actually contains major contradictions,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
because the history of the West is a history of change and revolution.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
So when a new movement comes along, like for instance a bunch of buzzkill sad-sacks

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
pointing out that actually our society is still pretty terrible to women,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
it might not be the smartest thing to just dismiss it

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
as some kind of sinister postmodern neo-Marxist cuckoldry.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
It could be the next Reformation, in a history marked by a series of Reformations.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
If there are any historians watching this, please call it the SJW Reformation.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Think about the Protestant Reformation.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
At the time, that probably seemed like a civilizational threat to the Holy Roman Empire,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
and it kinda was.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
But in retrospect, we see the Reformation as just as important a moment in Western culture

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
as the medieval period that preceded it.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
But today's counter-Reformation, made up of people like Orangey Smalls and Dr. Clean-Your-Room,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
uh, insist on pretending the current Reformation is some kind of alien threat.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
And as for the counter-counter-Reformation, well, that's what you pay a trashy tran to do.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Concept 3. Western Culture

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism between the Western Roman Catholic Church

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
But in its contemporary sense, the idea of a Western culture didn't really exist

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spengler's 1918 book The Decline of the West,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
an important influence on Nazi ideology.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
As long as people have been talking about Western culture,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
as I've discussed in several earlier videos which I encourage you not to watch.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
But the idea of Western culture was influential well beyond the Third Reich.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
At the height of European imperialism, the idea of a superior high culture of the West

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit the mysterious Orient.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist rhetoric under the rug,

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept in our schools and universities,

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
where you have to take courses like History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
which you didn't actually do any of the readings for

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
because you were too busy crouching in the bushes outside the dean's office

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
The consequence of this Western culture education is that we now all have this sense

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
that we belong to a continuous civilization whose crowning achievements are

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
the Ten Commandments, Jesus fucking Christ, Athenian pederasts, cathedrals, Mozart,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
human rights, science, and iPhones.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
But the reality is, this is an essentialist conglomeration of a history

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
that's much more nonlinear than we often think.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
We in the West claim to be the inheritors of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
is largely responsible for introducing Aristotle to Christian universities,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
but he never would have encountered Aristotle in the first place

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
while ancient Greek philosophy had been translated and commentated

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So the origins of Western culture aren't really unique to us at all.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
And the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
On the one hand you have Judeo-Christian values,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
and on the other hand you have degenerates like William Shakespeare,

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens and make out with each other.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
Which, for the record, is disgusting, and I condemn it, and I'll have no part in it.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Because if you didn't know, in Shakespeare times, boys in drag played female parts.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I wish I had female parts.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Working on it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Concept four, the free world.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
From 1941 to 1945, Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
an agricultural scientist from Iowa whom Democratic Party officials despised

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
for being what we'd now call a Democratic Socialist.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Wallace later ran for president in 1948 as a third-party candidate

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
on a platform of universal healthcare, anti-segregation, and opposition to the Cold War.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
During the campaign, Wallace was widely mocked in the press for his spiritualism,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
and what Time Magazine called his assault on the South,

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
that is, his quote, ostentatious ride through cities and towns

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
with his Negro secretary beside him, for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The poor, naive Wallace commented,

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
there is something so unlovely about hate when you see it distorting the human face.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
We'll get used to it, buddy. This is America.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Am I lecturing someone from 1948 about how bigoted this country is?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
This is fine.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote in the 1948 election,

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech titled

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
The Century of the Common Man,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
in which he contrasted what he called the slave world of fascists with the free world,

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
which he described as an incomplete and ongoing international people's revolution.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
No Nazi counter-revolution will stop him.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
The common man will smoke the Hitler stooges out into the open in the United States,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
in Latin America, and in India.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
He will destroy their influence.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
No Lavals, no Mussolinis will be tolerated in a free world.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it, but it was common during World War II,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
when the phrase the free world first entered common parlance,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers, including the Dirty Reds.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
After the war, the phrase the free world remained common in American politics,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
but the meaning shifted.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Instead of referring to the International Alliance Against Fascism,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
it referred to the capitalist West, as opposed to the communist East.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
The idea of the free capitalist West is still an important ingredient

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
in this jumbled concept we call Western civilization.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
So when Lobster Dad says there's a struggle between Marxism and the West,

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
it seems at first like he's just stuck in the 1980s or something.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Dad! What year do you think it is?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
They're on your side now, remember?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
The truth is, he's just using the term Neo-Marxism

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
to invoke Red Scare sentiment in opposition to the SJW Reformation.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
But the point I'm trying to make is that the West is a concept,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
or rather several contradictory concepts,

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
that are always posited in particular political circumstances

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
as one side of an us-versus-them opposition,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
whether it's the Christian West versus the infidels,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
the Enlightenment West versus Islam,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
the cultured West versus the colonized savages,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
the capitalist West versus the communist East,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
or the white European West versus the Jewish-cultural Marxist plot

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
to cock the sons of the North by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
and inundating their countries with a barbarous horde of third-world migrants.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I guess I have to say something about that.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Concept five, blood and soil.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer Richard Spencer

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
what he thinks the West is,

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic, and genetic inheritance

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
bequeathed to European people by their fair-skinned ancestors.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
could be part of the West is ridiculous

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
because, for Spencer, to be Western is to be white.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Now the thing about that is,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
as an analysis of the common usage of the term the West,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
it's not even wrong.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Consider Latin America, where the main languages spoken

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
are Spanish, Portuguese, and French,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
where the majority religion is Roman Catholicism.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the West?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Or to be more accurate,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
the flexible and historically variant concepts of whiteness and the West

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
have been constructed so as to exclude them.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And I've already spent half my YouTube career

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
on delirious gay screeching about Nazis,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
so I don't want to do more of that now.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
But suffice to say, the association between whiteness and the West

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
is always lurking beneath the surface,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and when whiteness rears its head proudly,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
As I'm making this video,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
the machinery of the middle stages of those crimes

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
is up and running yet again,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
and a racist demagogue in the United States.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
And once more, both continents are dotted with barbed wire,

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
refugee ghettos, and internment camps full of children torn from parents.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
The West, in many ways, is an inherently supremacist concept.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
It's thought to be more civilized, more holy, and more cultured than the non-West.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But there are some ridiculous college professors

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
According to them, the West is not uniquely civilized,

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
but uniquely uncivilized, cruel, imperialistic, racist, and genocidal.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
But this just perpetuates the same essentializing error.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Europeans aren't inherently more evil

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
any more than they're inherently more civilized.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa 400 years ago,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
the result would have been just as brutal.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So instead of vilifying the West,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
and acknowledge that the world is too complicated to reduce

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
to simple us-and-them binaries.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and classical music and the cheesecake factory.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
We can still keep all that shit,

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
while eliminating the propaganda and injustice that surrounds it.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
What if traps are gay?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
What if no one can ever love you?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
What if happiness is impossible?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
What if everyone who compliments me is lying,

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
so they can laugh at me later when I delusionally feel good about myself?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
What if when you die you stay conscious and then you just are un-

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
What if I'm standing in an awkward way and it looks weird?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
What if Blanchard is right?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and music is really great for that.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I've always liked classical music.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
When I listen to Mozart or Mendelssohn or even an amateur like Satie,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
And I don't care what civilization the composer came from,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
And I don't want to know, because I need this.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I need this feeling that makes me just want to take a big-

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
inside of my balls.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I could've fit two at once.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
So, okay, fine, he has the head of an ass,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
but there's certain advantages to that, that's all I'm saying.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Mmm.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't know.
