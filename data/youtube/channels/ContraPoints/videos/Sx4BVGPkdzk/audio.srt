1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,640
Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,800
Do they have any semblance of guilt?

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,280
A local World War 2 veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,320
what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,800
He believes what happened.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Scheisse!

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,640
To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,400
Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
1.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,760
People of European heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,400
unity known as the white race, sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
2.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,320
Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,720
non-white immigration, a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
3.

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,640
The only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,600
from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
Now as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,360
So what is it that's attracting people to fascism?

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,720
Well let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
that out.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Who are you?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:15,400
They could say, I'm a Roman, I'm a Saxon, I'm a Dane.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Good news boys, you no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,120
thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,200
because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,600
and defend Voltaire and adorable blonde children against black civil rights.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,240
You know, just like the Vikings did.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,840
We're often told that being an American, or a Briton or German or any European nationality,

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,280
is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
Democracy.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Freedom.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
Tolerance.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
Multiculturalism.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,120
But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,120
So life is basically sad, and in capitalist society that sadness is a sense of isolation,

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,880
an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990s collector's edition

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,600
Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Biersteins until you die.

44
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,440
Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself, a homeland for your people,

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,120
a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, and as far into the

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
future.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,480
Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,680
other human beings as property.

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,240
The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,520
The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,840
ethnostate is just nonsense.

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to is in no

54
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,600
way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,280
And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
the same thing.

57
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,720
But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
propaganda.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,600
In the wake of the disastrous alt-right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, the

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,200
At least two of their major websites were shut down, confederate monuments were removed

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,520
all over the country, and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.

63
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
None of this means fascists will go away, it just means they'll have to be more subtle

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
and indirect.

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,440
Shortly after the Charlottesville rally, a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,000
on Poll, the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,320
Japanese nymphettes.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,160
Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away

71
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
is really stupid.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,000
We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the overtone window

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,720
to the right, but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
white person.

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
And the way to do that isâ€¦

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,040
Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,360
There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes and

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,860
holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.

79
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,320
This instantly makes the average person hate you.

80
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,440
Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental, overt goals.

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,040
and prioritises white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,200
Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,720
Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,100
against you.

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,720
So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.

87
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Leftists will recognise dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,320
So at first glance, this seems like a really silly, juvenile post that references Dragonball Z.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,960
But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to

90
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,160
long-term goals that I wish were more common on the left.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,960
But of course, the strategy described here isn't new.

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,680
Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,200
When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,400
order to appeal to racists.

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,040
Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,640
You start out in 1954 by saying n***a, by 1968 you can't say n***a.

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,720
That hurts you, backfires.

98
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,080
So you say stuff like force bussing, states' rights, and all that stuff.

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,600
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,920
things that you're talking about are totally economic things.

101
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,560
And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,320
So if you want to recognise a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to

103
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,360
hear dog whistles, because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism,

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,640
and white supremacy, at least when talking to you, a non-fascist.

105
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,040
Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,520
Fascists are more likely to gain traction, and are hence more dangerous when they use

107
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
subtler tactics.

108
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,920
So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,720
to code their ideas, and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Strategy 1.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,920
Outright Denial.

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
Never reveal your power level.

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,680
This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking

115
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,320
points, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,520
should be worth absolutely nothing to you, and shouldn't even enter into your consideration

117
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,460
of whether they're a fascist.

118
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,920
After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.

119
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Strategy 2.

120
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Euphemism.

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course I'm not a fascist, I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
western values.

123
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,760
Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,280
that develop around the names of their movements whenever people figure out what they really

125
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
are.

126
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,960
So they insist they aren't Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.

127
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,240
But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
they'll shift their terminology again, and start telling you,

129
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

130
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,920
Or whatever the next thing is.

131
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,160
But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,640
They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.

133
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,840
If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist, they'll

134
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,140
talk about preserving western civilization or western culture instead.

135
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,720
If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,760
And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people, they'll talk instead

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,200
about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists, and leave it to the audience

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
to catch the color-coding on their own.

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Strategy 3.

140
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Pedantry.

141
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,360
It's absurd to call me a Nazi.

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,040
The German National Socialist Party hasn't existed since 1945.

143
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,200
That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.

144
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,760
Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels, and also to bog

145
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,400
you down in a petty terminological dispute.

146
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,720
This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led

147
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
you to call them a Nazi in the first place.

148
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,600
I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think whites are superior to other races, I simply

149
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,880
think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.

150
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,640
There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,800
IQs, he's if anything an Asian supremacist.

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,600
And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ instead of talking about the fact

153
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
that the main goal of the politics he supports is the political and social supremacy of white

154
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,480
people over all other Americans and Europeans, in other words, white supremacy.

155
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Strategy four, secret symbols.

156
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,000
or like the swastika itself, but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,640
handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.

159
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,480
The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with

160
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,760
fascism, or at least have some other meaning, such as the Othala rune or the iron cross.

161
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.

162
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,120
Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod

163
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,620
at each other, notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.

164
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,280
So it doesn't matter what the symbols are, in fact it's important that the symbols

165
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,160
constantly change so that normies don't catch on.

166
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,040
By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,360
Maybe it'll be this, or this.

168
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,300
The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to

169
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
identify themselves.

170
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,840
And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try

171
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,000
to point those symbols out, the fascists can always say,

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,680
These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.

173
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,440
Is there anything they don't think is racist?

174
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,520
And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.

175
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
The poor centrists.

176
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,000
They're so afraid that Antifa is gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,760
And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,520
So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or

179
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
because of the emoji they use.

180
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,040
These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.

181
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,240
But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political

182
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
rallies,

183
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,440
Oh god, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?

184
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,000
That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,360
And the fascists, whose free speech you defend so often, are trying to drum up exactly the

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,480
sentiments that make the police dangerous to black people, and that make it dangerous

187
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,960
for queer people to be themselves in public.

188
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,280
So I hope that's something you think about.

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,440
Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist, or that anyone who uses it is racist,

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,680
and in fact it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink

191
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
and nudge.

192
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,520
But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist sets the stage for

193
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Strategy 5, Comradery of the Accused.

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,040
The left accuses everyone of racism.

195
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,000
They think all white people are Nazis.

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,040
If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.

197
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,600
Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,

198
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,880
especially online.

199
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,120
Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism, and some of them

200
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,680
do throw the label at centrists or liberals.

201
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists, history shows that happens

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,080
regardless, but it can accelerate the process, lending some plausibility to the fear that

203
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,240
moderate centrists have that anti-fascists will come after them next.

204
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,280
It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation, and use it to

205
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,880
pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.

206
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,480
Strategy 6, Irony, Jokes, Satire, and Memes.

207
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,920
Of course I wasn't actually being racist.

208
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,120
It was just an edgy meme.

209
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,600
Can't anyone take a joke anymore, or will the antifa fascists violently attack you over

210
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,160
humor now too?

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,400
Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.

212
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,440
You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes, and then when called out, you mock

213
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,320
your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.

214
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,960
Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,000
Before I realized I was transgender, I used to jump at any opportunity to crossdress ironically.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,480
So when you see people joking about being Nazis, they could just be joking, or they

217
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,800
could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.

219
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,520
But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.

220
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,040
Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements that just happens to use a Nazi

221
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
battle flag.

222
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,960
And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers who are unable

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,440
or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists, Kekistan became the perfect

224
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,040
pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians, including the ones who led the rally where

225
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,280
an edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.

226
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,600
No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.

227
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Pfft, those normie fools.

228
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,840
It's just a joke.

229
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Strategy 7.

230
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Shifting Blame.

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,720
Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations like Black Lives

232
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,560
Matter or Antifa?

233
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,480
This is essentially just a tu quoque fallacy, especially heinous because of the equivocation

234
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,000
between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence, and between white nationalism and

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,440
black civil rights.

236
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,320
The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against black people

237
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,200
is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.

238
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,520
Shortly after the Charlottesville incident, our proto-fascist president called out Antifa

239
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,960
and the alt-left, a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists and establish

240
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,840
the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.

241
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,480
Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.

242
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,080
Both sides' rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,

243
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,040
vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists, and helps to shift the center of

244
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,840
acceptable discourse in their direction.

245
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Strategy 8.

246
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Incrementalism.

247
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,640
You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.

248
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,560
Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here, but we

249
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,960
do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,720
The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation, often aimed

251
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,280
at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people as a defense of white

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,000
people and white culture.

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,600
The fascists' long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate, which at some point will require

254
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,420
massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another.

255
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,640
But of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.

256
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,400
The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,

257
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,440
and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration, something they'll

258
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,560
try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with by emphasizing the

259
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,520
danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.

260
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,440
If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric, they can later turn that

261
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,080
energy against the non-white people who are already here.

262
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Strategy 9.

263
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
The Free Speech Defense

264
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,720
You may not agree with what I say, but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble

265
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,300
as anyone else.

266
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,120
intimidate, often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies, or by pressuring platforms

268
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
not to host fascists.

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,680
The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value

270
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,160
of free speech.

271
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,040
Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced

272
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
you are.

273
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,640
But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.

274
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,760
They only value the race, the people, the nation.

275
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,960
Their long-term goal is a society where there's no room for anyone who isn't white, or even

276
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,420
anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.

277
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,160
So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms, but remember,

278
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,880
you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.

279
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,920
They do not care about diversity of opinions.

280
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,800
That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation,

281
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,880
and to garner sympathy from centrists.

282
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.

283
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,920
They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.

284
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,160
Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children

285
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,720
who don't get sexual innuendo.

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,060
There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.

287
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,360
This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy

288
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,720
to exploit.

289
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,480
Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking

290
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,400
points without intending to or realizing it.

291
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,120
And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,920
Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate

293
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,960
fascist memes, then isn't just about everyone suspect?

294
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,200
Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?

295
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,960
Well that's what they want you to think.

296
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,640
They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.

297
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,440
I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-right or

298
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.

299
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,520
Likewise it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-right

300
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,800
but not an outright fascist and a fascist who is concealing their power level.

301
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,720
So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.

302
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,080
The other day the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption

303
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,800
this is the future ACLU members want.

304
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,680
And for a second I was like, what the fuck?

305
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,840
Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme, but of course it's unintentional,

306
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
it's the ACLU.

307
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,480
I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.

308
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Not make a quick statement.

309
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,840
The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.

310
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,240
But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.

311
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Yes, I have become crazy.

312
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,000
But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychological

313
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,040
consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists and

314
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,360
communicating in code.

315
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,520
And it's the intentional consequence of that.

316
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,360
Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist's psychological arsenal.

317
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,880
So how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?

318
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,

319
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,960
it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you, and I admit that

320
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,880
I am pretty frustrated with you right now.

321
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Obviously.

322
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,680
But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better

323
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,760
at resisting fascism.

324
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,160
Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning, so don't feel guilty for falling

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
for them.

326
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,720
Just try to get better at resisting.

327
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,000
I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.

328
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,360
If you care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for

329
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,200
that person by opposing the alt-right and its allies.

330
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,960
Do not give them a platform.

331
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,640
Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.

332
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,680
Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech, but they do not have a right to a

333
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,760
megaphone and you should not be giving them one.

334
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,840
I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas, everyone expressing

335
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,400
their ideas peacefully, but to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous,

336
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.

337
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,560
Now if you're just an average person without a big platform, then you actually can debate

338
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
and you should be debating.

339
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,880
Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty, argue with your family, argue

340
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,840
with your co-workers, let them know that you don't agree, make them listen to a different

341
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
perspective.

342
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,520
And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years

343
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,600
and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, you

344
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
have to get out now.

345
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,080
It's not too late, society will forgive you.

346
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,320
If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate, an organization founded by

347
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,820
a former neo-nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.

348
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,660
And as for all you lefties, nazdrovye.

349
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Keep up the good fight, comrades.
