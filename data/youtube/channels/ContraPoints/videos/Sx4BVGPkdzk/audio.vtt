00:00.000 --> 00:25.640
Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?

00:25.640 --> 00:28.800
Do they have any semblance of guilt?

00:28.800 --> 00:34.280
A local World War 2 veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried

00:34.280 --> 00:39.320
what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.800
He believes what happened.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Scheisse!

00:45.800 --> 00:50.800
Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.

00:50.800 --> 00:59.640
To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.400
Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
1.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.760
People of European heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political

01:07.760 --> 01:12.400
unity known as the white race, sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
2.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.320
Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and

01:17.320 --> 01:22.720
non-white immigration, a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.720
3.

01:23.720 --> 01:28.640
The only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,

01:28.640 --> 01:31.600
from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.520
Now as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.360
So what is it that's attracting people to fascism?

01:38.360 --> 01:42.720
Well let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure

01:42.720 --> 01:44.320
that out.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.200
Who are you?

01:48.200 --> 01:52.520
I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.560
I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.

01:56.560 --> 02:03.760
I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.

02:03.760 --> 02:08.520
Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.

02:08.520 --> 02:15.400
They could say, I'm a Roman, I'm a Saxon, I'm a Dane.

02:15.400 --> 02:20.800
Good news boys, you no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA

02:20.800 --> 02:26.120
thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate

02:26.120 --> 02:31.200
because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand

02:31.200 --> 02:36.600
and defend Voltaire and adorable blonde children against black civil rights.

02:36.680 --> 02:40.240
You know, just like the Vikings did.

02:42.720 --> 02:48.840
We're often told that being an American, or a Briton or German or any European nationality,

02:48.840 --> 02:55.280
is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.800
Democracy.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.000
Freedom.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.760
Tolerance.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.640
Multiculturalism.

03:02.680 --> 03:09.120
But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.

03:09.120 --> 03:16.120
So life is basically sad, and in capitalist society that sadness is a sense of isolation,

03:16.120 --> 03:20.880
an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990s collector's edition

03:20.880 --> 03:25.600
Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Biersteins until you die.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.440
Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.240
Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself, a homeland for your people,

03:34.240 --> 03:39.120
a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, and as far into the

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
future.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.480
Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling

03:44.480 --> 03:46.680
other human beings as property.

03:46.680 --> 03:51.240
The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.520
The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white

03:55.520 --> 03:57.840
ethnostate is just nonsense.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.840
Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to is in no

04:02.840 --> 04:07.600
way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.280
And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become

04:12.280 --> 04:13.560
the same thing.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.720
But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
propaganda.

04:18.720 --> 04:22.600
In the wake of the disastrous alt-right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, the

04:22.600 --> 04:25.000
Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.200
At least two of their major websites were shut down, confederate monuments were removed

04:29.200 --> 04:33.520
all over the country, and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.120
None of this means fascists will go away, it just means they'll have to be more subtle

04:37.120 --> 04:38.120
and indirect.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.440
Shortly after the Charlottesville rally, a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared

04:42.440 --> 04:47.000
on Poll, the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of

04:47.000 --> 04:49.320
Japanese nymphettes.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.320
The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.120
Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.160
Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away

05:01.160 --> 05:03.120
is really stupid.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.000
We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the overtone window

05:07.000 --> 05:11.720
to the right, but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
white person.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.720
And the way to do that isâ€¦

05:14.720 --> 05:19.040
Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.360
There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes and

05:23.360 --> 05:27.860
holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.320
This instantly makes the average person hate you.

05:31.320 --> 05:36.440
Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental, overt goals.

05:36.440 --> 05:42.320
Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration

05:42.320 --> 05:48.040
and prioritises white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.

05:48.040 --> 05:53.200
Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.720
Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning

05:58.720 --> 06:00.100
against you.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.720
So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.

06:03.720 --> 06:09.720
Leftists will recognise dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.

06:09.720 --> 06:15.320
So at first glance, this seems like a really silly, juvenile post that references Dragonball Z.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.960
But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to

06:19.960 --> 06:23.160
long-term goals that I wish were more common on the left.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.960
But of course, the strategy described here isn't new.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.680
Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.200
When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in

06:34.200 --> 06:36.400
order to appeal to racists.

06:36.400 --> 06:41.040
Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.

06:41.040 --> 06:47.640
You start out in 1954 by saying n***a, by 1968 you can't say n***a.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.720
That hurts you, backfires.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.080
So you say stuff like force bussing, states' rights, and all that stuff.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.600
You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these

06:58.600 --> 07:01.920
things that you're talking about are totally economic things.

07:01.920 --> 07:06.560
And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.320
So if you want to recognise a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to

07:10.320 --> 07:16.360
hear dog whistles, because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism,

07:16.360 --> 07:20.640
and white supremacy, at least when talking to you, a non-fascist.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.040
Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.520
Fascists are more likely to gain traction, and are hence more dangerous when they use

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
subtler tactics.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.920
So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use

07:33.920 --> 07:39.720
to code their ideas, and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.

07:39.720 --> 07:40.720
Strategy 1.

07:40.720 --> 07:41.920
Outright Denial.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.600
Never reveal your power level.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.040
Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.

07:46.040 --> 07:50.680
This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking

07:50.680 --> 07:55.320
points, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism

07:55.320 --> 07:59.520
should be worth absolutely nothing to you, and shouldn't even enter into your consideration

07:59.520 --> 08:01.460
of whether they're a fascist.

08:01.460 --> 08:06.920
After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.920
Strategy 2.

08:07.920 --> 08:08.920
Euphemism.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.000
Of course I'm not a fascist, I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve

08:14.000 --> 08:15.880
western values.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.760
Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations

08:19.760 --> 08:23.280
that develop around the names of their movements whenever people figure out what they really

08:23.280 --> 08:24.280
are.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.960
So they insist they aren't Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.

08:28.960 --> 08:33.240
But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,

08:33.240 --> 08:36.240
they'll shift their terminology again, and start telling you,

08:36.240 --> 08:39.120
I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.920
Or whatever the next thing is.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.160
But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.640
They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.840
If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist, they'll

08:51.840 --> 08:56.140
talk about preserving western civilization or western culture instead.

08:56.140 --> 09:00.720
If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.760
And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people, they'll talk instead

09:04.760 --> 09:09.200
about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists, and leave it to the audience

09:09.200 --> 09:12.160
to catch the color-coding on their own.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.160
Strategy 3.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.160
Pedantry.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.360
It's absurd to call me a Nazi.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.040
The German National Socialist Party hasn't existed since 1945.

09:21.040 --> 09:26.200
That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.760
Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels, and also to bog

09:30.760 --> 09:33.400
you down in a petty terminological dispute.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.720
This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led

09:36.720 --> 09:38.560
you to call them a Nazi in the first place.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.600
I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think whites are superior to other races, I simply

09:43.600 --> 09:47.880
think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.640
There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest

09:51.640 --> 09:54.800
IQs, he's if anything an Asian supremacist.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.600
And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ instead of talking about the fact

09:58.600 --> 10:03.160
that the main goal of the politics he supports is the political and social supremacy of white

10:03.160 --> 10:08.480
people over all other Americans and Europeans, in other words, white supremacy.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.480
Strategy four, secret symbols.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.120
Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring

10:16.120 --> 10:21.000
or like the swastika itself, but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret

10:21.000 --> 10:25.640
handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.480
The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with

10:29.520 --> 10:34.760
fascism, or at least have some other meaning, such as the Othala rune or the iron cross.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.760
Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.

10:39.760 --> 10:44.120
Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod

10:44.120 --> 10:49.620
at each other, notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.

10:49.620 --> 10:53.280
So it doesn't matter what the symbols are, in fact it's important that the symbols

10:53.280 --> 10:56.160
constantly change so that normies don't catch on.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.040
By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.360
Maybe it'll be this, or this.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.300
The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to

11:06.300 --> 11:07.300
identify themselves.

11:07.300 --> 11:11.840
And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try

11:11.840 --> 11:15.000
to point those symbols out, the fascists can always say,

11:15.000 --> 11:19.680
These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.440
Is there anything they don't think is racist?

11:22.440 --> 11:25.520
And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
The poor centrists.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.000
They're so afraid that Antifa is gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.760
And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.520
So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or

11:38.520 --> 11:40.520
because of the emoji they use.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.040
These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.

11:43.040 --> 11:47.240
But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
rallies,

11:48.240 --> 11:50.440
Oh god, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?

11:50.440 --> 11:54.000
That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.360
And the fascists, whose free speech you defend so often, are trying to drum up exactly the

11:58.360 --> 12:02.480
sentiments that make the police dangerous to black people, and that make it dangerous

12:02.480 --> 12:04.960
for queer people to be themselves in public.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.280
So I hope that's something you think about.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.440
Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist, or that anyone who uses it is racist,

12:12.440 --> 12:16.680
and in fact it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
and nudge.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.520
But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist sets the stage for

12:21.760 --> 12:25.000
Strategy 5, Comradery of the Accused.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.040
The left accuses everyone of racism.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.000
They think all white people are Nazis.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.040
If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.

12:34.040 --> 12:38.600
Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,

12:38.600 --> 12:39.880
especially online.

12:39.880 --> 12:45.120
Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism, and some of them

12:45.120 --> 12:47.680
do throw the label at centrists or liberals.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.000
This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists, history shows that happens

12:52.000 --> 12:57.080
regardless, but it can accelerate the process, lending some plausibility to the fear that

12:57.080 --> 13:01.240
moderate centrists have that anti-fascists will come after them next.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.280
It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation, and use it to

13:05.280 --> 13:08.880
pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.480
Strategy 6, Irony, Jokes, Satire, and Memes.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.920
Of course I wasn't actually being racist.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.120
It was just an edgy meme.

13:18.120 --> 13:22.600
Can't anyone take a joke anymore, or will the antifa fascists violently attack you over

13:22.600 --> 13:24.160
humor now too?

13:24.160 --> 13:27.400
Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.440
You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes, and then when called out, you mock

13:32.440 --> 13:36.320
your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.960
Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.

13:40.960 --> 13:47.000
Before I realized I was transgender, I used to jump at any opportunity to crossdress ironically.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.480
So when you see people joking about being Nazis, they could just be joking, or they

13:51.480 --> 13:54.800
could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.160
It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.520
But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.

14:01.520 --> 14:07.040
Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements that just happens to use a Nazi

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
battle flag.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.960
And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers who are unable

14:12.960 --> 14:17.440
or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists, Kekistan became the perfect

14:17.440 --> 14:23.040
pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians, including the ones who led the rally where

14:23.040 --> 14:27.280
an edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.600
No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
Pfft, those normie fools.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.840
It's just a joke.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
Strategy 7.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.840
Shifting Blame.

14:37.040 --> 14:41.720
Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations like Black Lives

14:41.720 --> 14:43.560
Matter or Antifa?

14:43.560 --> 14:48.480
This is essentially just a tu quoque fallacy, especially heinous because of the equivocation

14:48.480 --> 14:53.000
between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence, and between white nationalism and

14:53.000 --> 14:54.440
black civil rights.

14:54.440 --> 14:59.320
The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against black people

14:59.320 --> 15:03.200
is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.520
Shortly after the Charlottesville incident, our proto-fascist president called out Antifa

15:07.520 --> 15:12.960
and the alt-left, a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists and establish

15:12.960 --> 15:16.840
the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.480
Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.080
Both sides' rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,

15:25.080 --> 15:30.040
vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists, and helps to shift the center of

15:30.040 --> 15:32.840
acceptable discourse in their direction.

15:32.840 --> 15:33.840
Strategy 8.

15:33.840 --> 15:34.840
Incrementalism.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.640
You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.560
Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here, but we

15:43.560 --> 15:46.960
do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?

15:46.960 --> 15:51.720
The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation, often aimed

15:51.720 --> 15:56.280
at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people as a defense of white

15:56.280 --> 15:58.000
people and white culture.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.600
The fascists' long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate, which at some point will require

16:02.600 --> 16:05.420
massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another.

16:05.420 --> 16:09.640
But of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.

16:09.640 --> 16:14.400
The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,

16:14.400 --> 16:18.440
and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration, something they'll

16:18.440 --> 16:23.560
try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with by emphasizing the

16:23.560 --> 16:27.520
danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.440
If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric, they can later turn that

16:31.440 --> 16:35.080
energy against the non-white people who are already here.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
Strategy 9.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
The Free Speech Defense

16:37.080 --> 16:41.720
You may not agree with what I say, but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble

16:41.720 --> 16:43.300
as anyone else.

16:43.300 --> 16:48.600
Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and

16:48.600 --> 16:53.120
intimidate, often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies, or by pressuring platforms

16:53.120 --> 16:54.720
not to host fascists.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.680
The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value

16:58.680 --> 17:00.160
of free speech.

17:00.160 --> 17:05.040
Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
you are.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.640
But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.760
They only value the race, the people, the nation.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.960
Their long-term goal is a society where there's no room for anyone who isn't white, or even

17:17.960 --> 17:20.420
anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.

17:20.420 --> 17:25.160
So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms, but remember,

17:25.160 --> 17:27.880
you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.920
They do not care about diversity of opinions.

17:30.920 --> 17:35.800
That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation,

17:35.800 --> 17:37.880
and to garner sympathy from centrists.

17:58.760 --> 18:04.600
Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.920
They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.

18:08.920 --> 18:13.160
Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children

18:13.160 --> 18:14.720
who don't get sexual innuendo.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.060
There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.

18:18.060 --> 18:22.360
This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy

18:22.360 --> 18:23.720
to exploit.

18:23.720 --> 18:28.480
Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking

18:28.480 --> 18:31.400
points without intending to or realizing it.

18:31.400 --> 18:36.120
And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.

18:36.120 --> 18:40.920
Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate

18:40.920 --> 18:43.960
fascist memes, then isn't just about everyone suspect?

18:43.960 --> 18:48.200
Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.960
Well that's what they want you to think.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.640
They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.

18:53.640 --> 18:57.440
I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-right or

18:57.440 --> 19:00.880
if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.520
Likewise it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-right

19:04.520 --> 19:08.800
but not an outright fascist and a fascist who is concealing their power level.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.720
So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.

19:11.720 --> 19:16.080
The other day the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption

19:16.080 --> 19:18.800
this is the future ACLU members want.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.680
And for a second I was like, what the fuck?

19:21.720 --> 19:25.840
Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme, but of course it's unintentional,

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
it's the ACLU.

19:26.840 --> 19:34.480
I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
Not make a quick statement.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.840
The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.

19:39.840 --> 19:44.240
But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.360
Yes, I have become crazy.

19:46.360 --> 19:51.000
But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychological

19:51.000 --> 19:56.040
consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists and

19:56.040 --> 19:57.360
communicating in code.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.520
And it's the intentional consequence of that.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.360
Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist's psychological arsenal.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.880
So how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?

20:07.880 --> 20:12.880
I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,

20:12.880 --> 20:16.960
it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you, and I admit that

20:16.960 --> 20:19.880
I am pretty frustrated with you right now.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.880
Obviously.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.680
But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better

20:24.680 --> 20:26.760
at resisting fascism.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.160
Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning, so don't feel guilty for falling

20:31.160 --> 20:32.160
for them.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.720
Just try to get better at resisting.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.000
I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.360
If you care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for

20:43.360 --> 20:46.200
that person by opposing the alt-right and its allies.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.960
Do not give them a platform.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.640
Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.680
Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech, but they do not have a right to a

20:54.680 --> 20:56.760
megaphone and you should not be giving them one.

20:56.760 --> 21:00.840
I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas, everyone expressing

21:00.840 --> 21:06.400
their ideas peacefully, but to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous,

21:06.400 --> 21:09.600
because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.560
Now if you're just an average person without a big platform, then you actually can debate

21:13.560 --> 21:15.160
and you should be debating.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.880
Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty, argue with your family, argue

21:18.880 --> 21:22.840
with your co-workers, let them know that you don't agree, make them listen to a different

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
perspective.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.520
And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years

21:27.520 --> 21:31.600
and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, you

21:31.600 --> 21:33.000
have to get out now.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.080
It's not too late, society will forgive you.

21:36.080 --> 21:40.320
If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate, an organization founded by

21:40.320 --> 21:43.820
a former neo-nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.660
And as for all you lefties, nazdrovye.

21:46.660 --> 21:48.660
Keep up the good fight, comrades.
