0	25640	Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
25640	28800	Do they have any semblance of guilt?
28800	34280	A local World War 2 veteran wants you to hear and see this next story because he's worried
34280	39320	what he fought against so long ago is making a comeback here in the United States.
39320	40800	He believes what happened.
43800	44800	Scheisse!
45800	50800	Hi, in this video I'm going to talk about how to recognize a fascist.
50800	59640	To begin, let's take a look at what fascism is.
59640	62400	Contemporary fascists share three core beliefs.
62400	63400	1.
63400	67760	People of European heritage are or ought to constitute a biological, cultural, and political
67760	72400	unity known as the white race, sometimes dog-whistled as Western culture.
72400	73400	2.
73400	77320	Jews are masterminding the destruction of the white race through multiculturalism and
77320	82720	non-white immigration, a plot that fascists call white genocide or ethnic replacement.
82720	83720	3.
83720	88640	The only way to save the white race is to establish a white homeland, or ethnostate,
88640	91600	from which non-whites and degenerates must be purged.
91600	95520	Now as I've argued in past videos, all three of these beliefs are false.
95520	98360	So what is it that's attracting people to fascism?
98360	102720	Well let's take a look at a contemporary Nazi propaganda video and see if we can figure
102720	104320	that out.
105120	108200	Who are you?
108200	112520	I'm not talking about your name or your occupation.
112520	116560	I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper.
116560	123760	I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny.
123760	128520	Our ancestors had a very strong sense of their identity.
128520	135400	They could say, I'm a Roman, I'm a Saxon, I'm a Dane.
135400	140800	Good news boys, you no longer have to be some schlubby fuck riding the escalator at IKEA
140800	146120	thinking about how much you hate your job as a marketing and communications associate
146120	151200	because the sun hath risen on the day wherein you take your father's claymore in hand
151200	156600	and defend Voltaire and adorable blonde children against black civil rights.
156680	160240	You know, just like the Vikings did.
162720	168840	We're often told that being an American, or a Briton or German or any European nationality,
168840	175280	is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords.
175280	176800	Democracy.
176800	178000	Freedom.
178000	179760	Tolerance.
179760	182640	Multiculturalism.
182680	189120	But a nation based on freedom is just another place to go shopping.
189120	196120	So life is basically sad, and in capitalist society that sadness is a sense of isolation,
196120	200880	an anxiety that there's nothing more to life than acquiring 1990s collector's edition
200880	205600	Tampa Bay Buccaneers slash Slim Jim Biersteins until you die.
205600	209440	Fortunately, thanks to fascism, you don't have to.
209480	214240	Fascism promises you a part in something greater than yourself, a homeland for your people,
214240	219120	a sense of belonging to a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, and as far into the
219120	220120	future.
220120	224480	Just be sure to be extra proud of the parts of your heritage that involve buying and selling
224480	226680	other human beings as property.
226680	231240	The most basic way to resist fascism is to recognize its propaganda for what it is.
231240	235520	The idea that appreciating European culture is in some way linked to establishing a white
235520	237840	ethnostate is just nonsense.
237840	242840	Your enjoyment of Beethoven or white babies or whatever it is you get off to is in no
242840	247600	way impeded by the proximity of people with different skin colors and traditions.
247600	252280	And it certainly does not require nation, culture, and geographic ancestry to all become
252280	253560	the same thing.
253560	257720	But in order to recognize fascism, you need to do a lot more than reject the most overt
257720	258720	propaganda.
258720	262600	In the wake of the disastrous alt-right rally in Charlottesville earlier this month, the
262600	265000	Nazis have been driven back into the shadows.
265000	269200	At least two of their major websites were shut down, confederate monuments were removed
269200	273520	all over the country, and several prominent fascists have begun backpedaling.
273520	277120	None of this means fascists will go away, it just means they'll have to be more subtle
277120	278120	and indirect.
278120	282440	Shortly after the Charlottesville rally, a post titled Fixing the Alt-Right appeared
282440	287000	on Poll, the image board where millennial Nazis talk strategy and trade pictures of
287000	289320	Japanese nymphettes.
289320	292320	The post outlines some basic fascist strategy.
292560	297120	Don't get trapped in an echo chamber where you can no longer relate to normies.
297120	301160	Pretending that Charlottesville didn't massively push the average white person away
301160	303120	is really stupid.
303120	307000	We have a chance to actually make changes now that Trump has shifted the overtone window
307000	311720	to the right, but we need to be smart and make the movement appealing to the average
311720	312720	white person.
312720	314720	And the way to do that isâ€¦
314720	319040	Disavow all Nazi slash KKK edgelord larpers.
319040	323360	There is no way to lose public support quicker than going around making Nazi salutes and
323360	327860	holding tiki torches while chanting Jews will not replace us.
327860	331320	This instantly makes the average person hate you.
331320	336440	Build a populist movement with realistic, incremental, overt goals.
336440	342320	Repealing the 1965 Immigration Act and replacing it with something that both limits total immigration
342320	348040	and prioritises white immigration is an actual, tangible political goal.
348040	353200	Keep the long-term goals covert and don't ever reveal your power level.
353200	358720	Talking openly about a white ethnostate only leads to failure and the average public turning
358720	360100	against you.
360100	363720	So disavow anyone who reveals his power level.
363720	369720	Leftists will recognise dog whistles and know we're crypto, but normies won't listen to them.
369720	375320	So at first glance, this seems like a really silly, juvenile post that references Dragonball Z.
375320	379960	But it actually displays a sense of realistic pragmatism and an incremental approach to
379960	383160	long-term goals that I wish were more common on the left.
383160	385960	But of course, the strategy described here isn't new.
385960	389680	Older generations of white supremacists have been doing this stuff for decades.
389680	394200	When overt racism is politically unacceptable, politicians have to use coded language in
394200	396400	order to appeal to racists.
396400	401040	Republican strategist Lee Atwater explained the technique in an interview in 1981.
401040	407640	You start out in 1954 by saying n***a, by 1968 you can't say n***a.
407640	409720	That hurts you, backfires.
409720	414080	So you say stuff like force bussing, states' rights, and all that stuff.
414080	418600	You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these
418600	421920	things that you're talking about are totally economic things.
421920	426560	And a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites.
426560	430320	So if you want to recognise a fascist, you have to know how to read subtext and how to
430320	436360	hear dog whistles, because 99 times out of 100, a fascist will disavow fascism, racism,
436360	440640	and white supremacy, at least when talking to you, a non-fascist.
440640	445040	Rallies with swastikas and Nazi salutes are the exception, not the rule.
445040	448520	Fascists are more likely to gain traction, and are hence more dangerous when they use
448520	449520	subtler tactics.
449520	453920	So for the rest of this video, I'll be describing the particular strategies that fascists use
453920	459720	to code their ideas, and make them more palatable to conservatives, centrists, and liberals.
459720	460720	Strategy 1.
460720	461920	Outright Denial.
461920	463600	Never reveal your power level.
463600	466040	Disavow anyone who reveals their power level.
466040	470680	This means that if someone acts like a fascist, has fascist beliefs, repeats fascist talking
470680	475320	points, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism
475320	479520	should be worth absolutely nothing to you, and shouldn't even enter into your consideration
479520	481460	of whether they're a fascist.
481460	486920	After all, I'm not a fascist is exactly what a fascist would say.
486920	487920	Strategy 2.
487920	488920	Euphemism.
489120	494000	Of course I'm not a fascist, I'm an alternative ethno-nationalist simply trying to preserve
494000	495880	western values.
495880	499760	Fascists constantly shift their terminology in order to avoid the negative connotations
499760	503280	that develop around the names of their movements whenever people figure out what they really
503280	504280	are.
504280	508960	So they insist they aren't Nazis or white supremacists, just white nationalists or alt-right.
508960	513240	But as people catch on to the fact that white nationalists and the alt-right are just Nazis,
513240	516240	they'll shift their terminology again, and start telling you,
516240	519120	I'm not a white nationalist, I'm an identitarian.
519120	520920	Or whatever the next thing is.
520920	524160	But it's still the same bastards, they're just using a different name.
524160	527640	They'll also use euphemisms for core components of their beliefs.
527640	531840	If talking about preserving a homeland for white people sounds too fascist, they'll
531840	536140	talk about preserving western civilization or western culture instead.
536140	540720	If the phrase white genocide discredits them, they'll say ethnic replacement instead.
540720	544760	And if it's considered hate speech to advocate purging non-white people, they'll talk instead
544760	549200	about purging immigrants, criminals, rapists, and terrorists, and leave it to the audience
549200	552160	to catch the color-coding on their own.
552160	553160	Strategy 3.
553160	554160	Pedantry.
554160	556360	It's absurd to call me a Nazi.
556360	561040	The German National Socialist Party hasn't existed since 1945.
561040	566200	That's right, and I bet he's an isolationist too, not an expansionist like the Nazis.
566200	570760	Fascists use this kind of selective pedantry to dodge derogatory labels, and also to bog
570760	573400	you down in a petty terminological dispute.
573400	576720	This is a good way to waste your time and divert your attention away from whatever led
576720	578560	you to call them a Nazi in the first place.
578560	583600	I'm not a white supremacist, I don't think whites are superior to other races, I simply
583600	587880	think we deserve a homeland of our own, as do all peoples.
587880	591640	There it is again, and next he's going to tell us that since Asians have the highest
591640	594800	IQs, he's if anything an Asian supremacist.
594800	598600	And then you'll get sucked into arguing about IQ instead of talking about the fact
598600	603160	that the main goal of the politics he supports is the political and social supremacy of white
603160	608480	people over all other Americans and Europeans, in other words, white supremacy.
608480	611480	Strategy four, secret symbols.
611480	616120	Nazis have always taken an interest in occult symbols like the black sun on Fritz's ring
616120	621000	or like the swastika itself, but more obscure symbols can be useful as a kind of secret
621000	625640	handshake that lets Nazis recognize each other without normies taking notice.
625640	629480	The best symbols to use for this purpose are ones that are not primarily associated with
629520	634760	fascism, or at least have some other meaning, such as the Othala rune or the iron cross.
634760	639760	Better still are symbols that, until adoption by fascists, are completely innocuous.
639760	644120	Modern fascists have taken to using almost arbitrary emoji as a way to wink and nod
644120	649620	at each other, notably the frog after Pepe, the milk, and the okay sign.
649620	653280	So it doesn't matter what the symbols are, in fact it's important that the symbols
653280	656160	constantly change so that normies don't catch on.
656160	660040	By the time you watch this video, they probably won't even be using the frog anymore.
660040	662360	Maybe it'll be this, or this.
662360	666300	The only way to find out is to watch fascists carefully and see what symbols they use to
666300	667300	identify themselves.
667300	671840	And of course, another advantage of using innocuous symbols is that when leftists try
671840	675000	to point those symbols out, the fascists can always say,
675000	679680	These gullible SJWs now think that even the okay sign is racist.
679680	682440	Is there anything they don't think is racist?
682440	685520	And the gullible centrists will be taken right in.
685520	686520	The poor centrists.
686520	691000	They're so afraid that Antifa is gonna punch them because of their hair or their emoji.
691000	693760	And you know, some leftists are assholes or idiots.
693760	698520	So I should say, you should never assume someone is a fascist just because of their hair or
698520	700520	because of the emoji they use.
700520	703040	These are only little pieces of a larger puzzle.
703040	707240	But white centrists also need to understand that the way you feel about Antifa at political
707240	708240	rallies,
708240	710440	Oh god, what if they profile me and attack me unfairly?
710440	714000	That's how a lot of black people feel about the police all the time.
714000	718360	And the fascists, whose free speech you defend so often, are trying to drum up exactly the
718360	722480	sentiments that make the police dangerous to black people, and that make it dangerous
722480	724960	for queer people to be themselves in public.
724960	727280	So I hope that's something you think about.
727280	732440	Anyway, it's not that the okay sign is inherently racist, or that anyone who uses it is racist,
732440	736680	and in fact it's its very innocuousness that makes it useful as a crypto-fascist wink
736680	737680	and nudge.
737680	741520	But the misunderstanding about calling these little things racist sets the stage for
741760	745000	Strategy 5, Comradery of the Accused.
745000	747040	The left accuses everyone of racism.
747040	749000	They think all white people are Nazis.
749000	754040	If it's acceptable to attack and censor me, they'll come for you next.
754040	758600	Fascists have very effectively exploited the general hostility towards social justice warriors,
758600	759880	especially online.
759880	765120	Unfortunately, not all leftists have my connoisseur's eye for detecting fascism, and some of them
765120	767680	do throw the label at centrists or liberals.
767680	772000	This doesn't cause centrists to become allied with fascists, history shows that happens
772000	777080	regardless, but it can accelerate the process, lending some plausibility to the fear that
777080	781240	moderate centrists have that anti-fascists will come after them next.
781240	785280	It's tactically smart for fascists to make the most of this situation, and use it to
785280	788880	pump up sympathy and solidarity from centrists.
788880	793480	Strategy 6, Irony, Jokes, Satire, and Memes.
793480	795920	Of course I wasn't actually being racist.
795920	798120	It was just an edgy meme.
798120	802600	Can't anyone take a joke anymore, or will the antifa fascists violently attack you over
802600	804160	humor now too?
804160	807400	Here's a uniquely millennial twist on the racist dog whistle.
807400	812440	You shroud your sincere ideas in cartoon characters and memes, and then when called out, you mock
812440	816320	your accuser for being a clueless normie who isn't in on the joke.
816320	820960	Sometimes irony can be a safe way to explore ideas that you're not quite ready to own yet.
820960	827000	Before I realized I was transgender, I used to jump at any opportunity to crossdress ironically.
827000	831480	So when you see people joking about being Nazis, they could just be joking, or they
831480	834800	could be using irony to partially conceal the truth.
834800	838160	It's difficult to tell the difference, and that's the point.
838160	841520	But Kekistan is just a satire of identity politics.
841520	847040	Well, it's a hilarious satire of civil rights movements that just happens to use a Nazi
847040	848040	battle flag.
848120	852960	And while it may have been popularized originally by goddamn centrist YouTubers who are unable
852960	857440	or unwilling to see how helpful they're being to fascists, Kekistan became the perfect
857440	863040	pseudo-ironic pretext for, uh, identitarians, including the ones who led the rally where
863040	867280	an edgy shitposter hilariously memed his car into a crowd of people.
867280	870600	No wonder the SPLC now describes it as a hate symbol.
870600	872600	Pfft, those normie fools.
872600	874840	It's just a joke.
874840	875840	Strategy 7.
875840	876840	Shifting Blame.
877040	881720	Why doesn't the mainstream media cover violent anti-white organizations like Black Lives
881720	883560	Matter or Antifa?
883560	888480	This is essentially just a tu quoque fallacy, especially heinous because of the equivocation
888480	893000	between fascist violence and anti-fascist violence, and between white nationalism and
893000	894440	black civil rights.
894440	899320	The implication is that activism to reduce urban poverty or violence against black people
899320	903200	is just the mirror image of white supremacist ethnic cleansing.
903200	907520	Shortly after the Charlottesville incident, our proto-fascist president called out Antifa
907520	912960	and the alt-left, a term fascists invented to distract liberals and centrists and establish
912960	916840	the assumption that there must be some leftist equivalent of the alt-right.
916840	920480	Because if you have a word for a thing, that thing must exist.
920480	925080	Both sides' rhetoric is useful to fascists because it diverts attention away from them,
925080	930040	vilifies anti-fascists, wins sympathy from centrists, and helps to shift the center of
930040	932840	acceptable discourse in their direction.
932840	933840	Strategy 8.
933840	934840	Incrementalism.
934840	939640	You don't have to support a white ethnostate to want common-sense policies about immigration.
939640	943560	Of course I don't support violence against the non-white people already here, but we
943560	946960	do have a right to preserve our boundaries and our culture, don't we?
946960	951720	The common thread in all fascist strategies is deception and manipulation, often aimed
951720	956280	at representing what is essentially an attack on non-white people as a defense of white
956280	958000	people and white culture.
958000	962600	The fascists' long-term goal is a homogenous ethnostate, which at some point will require
962600	965420	massive ethnic cleansing of one kind or another.
965420	969640	But of course they won't tell you about that unless they think you're also a fascist.
969640	974400	The strategic fascist knows it's better to start with realistic, achievable goals,
974400	978440	and that means focusing first on stopping non-white immigration, something they'll
978440	983560	try to get you, the centrist, conservative, or liberal, on board with by emphasizing the
983560	987520	danger and criminality of non-white immigrants and refugees.
987520	991440	If they can whip up enough racist sentiment with that rhetoric, they can later turn that
991440	995080	energy against the non-white people who are already here.
995080	996080	Strategy 9.
996080	997080	The Free Speech Defense
997080	1001720	You may not agree with what I say, but I have just as much a right to speak and assemble
1001720	1003300	as anyone else.
1003300	1008600	Much of anti-fascist strategy involves limiting fascists' ability to publicly recruit and
1008600	1013120	intimidate, often by shutting down fascist marches and rallies, or by pressuring platforms
1013120	1014720	not to host fascists.
1014720	1018680	The best way for the fascists to oppose that strategy is to appeal to the liberal value
1018680	1020160	of free speech.
1020160	1025040	Nothing tugs on those classical liberal heartstrings like a tale of woe about how unfairly silenced
1025040	1026040	you are.
1026040	1030640	But remember, fascists do not actually value freedom, democracy, or diversity.
1030640	1033760	They only value the race, the people, the nation.
1033760	1037960	Their long-term goal is a society where there's no room for anyone who isn't white, or even
1037960	1040420	anyone who isn't a fascist, to exist.
1040420	1045160	So you can begrudgingly concede to fascists their constitutional freedoms, but remember,
1045160	1047880	you shouldn't expect any reciprocity from them.
1047880	1050920	They do not care about diversity of opinions.
1050920	1055800	That kind of talking point is just a ploy to protect fascist recruitment and intimidation,
1055800	1057880	and to garner sympathy from centrists.
1078760	1084600	Fascist strategies work because centrists are usually naive about them.
1084600	1088920	They don't notice dog whistles and usually give fascists the benefit of the doubt.
1088920	1093160	Following politics with centrists can be like watching a raunchy comedy movie with children
1093160	1094720	who don't get sexual innuendo.
1094720	1098060	There's a whole hidden layer of meaning that they're not picking up.
1098060	1102360	This makes liberals, centrists, and conservatives who are not savvy to fascist strategy easy
1102360	1103720	to exploit.
1103720	1108480	Time and time again, such people end up inadvertently spreading around fascist memes and talking
1108480	1111400	points without intending to or realizing it.
1111400	1116120	And then they end up bewildered when leftists who recognize the dog whistles take offense.
1116120	1120920	Now you might wonder, well, if fascists disguise themselves and liberals inadvertently duplicate
1120920	1123960	fascist memes, then isn't just about everyone suspect?
1123960	1128200	Aren't you in fact just a paranoid leftist who thinks everyone is a Nazi?
1128200	1129960	Well that's what they want you to think.
1129960	1133640	They benefit from the confusion and the appearance that the left is paranoid.
1133640	1137440	I'll admit there are cases where I can't tell if someone is genuinely alt-right or
1137440	1140880	if they're just an oblivious centrist who picked up the talking points.
1140880	1144520	Likewise it can be impossible to tell the difference between someone who is alt-right
1144520	1148800	but not an outright fascist and a fascist who is concealing their power level.
1148800	1151720	So in a sense, yes, I am a little bit paranoid.
1151720	1156080	The other day the ACLU tweeted a picture of an adorable blonde child with the caption
1156080	1158800	this is the future ACLU members want.
1158800	1161680	And for a second I was like, what the fuck?
1161720	1165840	Because it has a close resemblance to a 14 words meme, but of course it's unintentional,
1165840	1166840	it's the ACLU.
1166840	1174480	I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.
1174480	1175480	Not make a quick statement.
1175480	1179840	The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.
1179840	1184240	But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.
1184240	1186360	Yes, I have become crazy.
1186360	1191000	But this paranoia, self-doubt, and questioning of your own perception is the psychological
1191000	1196040	consequence of being constantly gaslit by fascists pretending not to be fascists and
1196040	1197360	communicating in code.
1197360	1200520	And it's the intentional consequence of that.
1200520	1204360	Gaslighting is just another tool in the fascist's psychological arsenal.
1204360	1207880	So how do we get better at resisting fascist strategies?
1207880	1212880	I know if you're a centrist who has inadvertently repeated fascist rhetoric or defended fascists,
1212880	1216960	it seems like the left all thinks you're a Nazi and that we hate you, and I admit that
1216960	1219880	I am pretty frustrated with you right now.
1219880	1220880	Obviously.
1220880	1224680	But my forgiveness and encouragement are wide open to anyone who wants to get better
1224680	1226760	at resisting fascism.
1226760	1231160	Fascist strategies can be very subtle and very cunning, so don't feel guilty for falling
1231160	1232160	for them.
1232160	1233720	Just try to get better at resisting.
1233720	1238000	I guess my message to liberals, centrists, and non-fascist conservatives is this.
1238000	1243360	If you care about even one person of color, or queer person, or immigrant, stand up for
1243360	1246200	that person by opposing the alt-right and its allies.
1246200	1247960	Do not give them a platform.
1247960	1250640	Do not host debates with them on your YouTube channel.
1250640	1254680	Yes, they have a constitutional right to free speech, but they do not have a right to a
1254680	1256760	megaphone and you should not be giving them one.
1256760	1260840	I know to a lot of you this just seems like the free marketplace of ideas, everyone expressing
1260840	1266400	their ideas peacefully, but to more vulnerable people, some ideas can be existentially dangerous,
1266400	1269600	because if those ideas catch on, their lives are at stake.
1269600	1273560	Now if you're just an average person without a big platform, then you actually can debate
1273560	1275160	and you should be debating.
1275160	1278880	Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt-righty, argue with your family, argue
1278880	1282840	with your co-workers, let them know that you don't agree, make them listen to a different
1282840	1283840	perspective.
1283840	1287520	And if you're someone who's gotten involved with the alt-right in the last couple years
1287520	1291600	and is now disillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, you
1291600	1293000	have to get out now.
1293000	1296080	It's not too late, society will forgive you.
1296080	1300320	If you don't know how to leave, look up Life After Hate, an organization founded by
1300320	1303820	a former neo-nazi that helps people get out of hate groups.
1303820	1306660	And as for all you lefties, nazdrovye.
1306660	1308660	Keep up the good fight, comrades.
