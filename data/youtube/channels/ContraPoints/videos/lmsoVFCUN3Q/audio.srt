1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,500
ðŸŽµ

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:49,620
ðŸŽµ

3
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,380
So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?

4
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,900
Well, I don't know.

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,980
What do I look like to you, some kind of philosopher?

6
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,580
ðŸŽµ

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,100
So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,380
not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.

9
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,220
ðŸŽµ

10
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,740
However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,

11
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,060
I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,860
well, violence is fun.

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,340
ðŸŽµ

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,780
And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.

15
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,020
It's not fun when other people are violent to you.

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,780
I mean, unless that's what you're into.

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,100
ðŸŽµ

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,700
That is what I'm into.

19
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,300
Did I say you could speak?

20
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,260
No, mistress.

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,620
Then shut up!

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:02:04,740
ðŸŽµ

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,700
Mmm, that's good.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,220
Chocolaty.

25
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,660
Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,140
and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,700
Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
I mean, if you're going to watch a non-violent movie,

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,540
you may as well read a fucking book.

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,660
What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to

31
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,300
viddy the old ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,780
a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,300
What's creepy about Alex is the film encourages us to identify with him,

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,980
and he kind of draws us in.

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,580
I mean, he listens to Beethoven,

36
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,540
and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.

37
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,900
Also, he tries the wine.

38
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,100
Try the wine!

39
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,660
Shh!

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,460
So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,580
and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,620
and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,660
It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.

44
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,060
So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,140
How normal is it to enjoy violence?

46
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,780
I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,140
but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,900
where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,620
And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience,

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,220
and I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,660
watching A Clockwork Orange.

52
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,420
It's not that they don't enjoy violence,

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,500
it's that in order for them to enjoy violence,

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,300
they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,020
and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.

56
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,180
I guess it's kind of like sex.

57
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,460
At least, not since I started taking this shit.

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know.

60
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,140
A little goddamn ambiance.

61
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,460
And you could say that the moral conscience

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,660
is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.

63
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,500
You can't properly enjoy violence

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,300
with all that internal nagging going on in the background.

65
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,260
But in that case,

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,540
what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,820
What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,940
Well, think about the TV show Law & Order SVU,

69
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,900
which has just as much sex and violence as A Clockwork Orange,

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,820
but which is much more popular.

71
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,260
SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,660
brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders

73
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,820
and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.

74
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,340
You like that, don't you?

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,860
I love it so much.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,220
You all do.

77
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,900
I think a lot of the appeal of SVU

78
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,140
is that it gives upstanding American citizens

79
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,340
a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes

80
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,420
while promising the moral purification

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,340
of justified police violence.

82
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,540
Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance

83
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,740
of the moral psyche.

84
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,380
When we believe that violence is morally justified,

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,940
when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,060
fucking deserved it,

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,620
we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.

88
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,420
Exactly.

89
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,500
And I think this kind of moral lampshading

90
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,940
partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines

91
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,260
you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow,

92
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,420
and Curious George Kills the Rapist.

93
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,180
For viewers with too many moral hangups

94
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,340
to get off on totally senseless violence,

95
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,340
a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way

96
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,260
to establish the emotional precedent

97
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,580
required for gratifying bloody payoff.

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,940
But I wonder if there may not be

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,620
as much of a psychological difference

100
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,500
between the good person's enjoyment of justified violence

101
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,900
and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random violence

102
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,340
as we might like to think.

103
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,740
Yes, the good person has a moral conscience

104
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,580
as a kind of inhibitive influence,

105
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,020
but once you get past that,

106
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,580
there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture

107
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,260
in swinging, thrashing, stabbing, shooting,

108
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,780
blasting, and burning,

109
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,420
an aesthetics of violence and destruction.

110
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,220
Now I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence

111
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,060
because I empathize with the victim

112
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,860
and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.

113
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,940
I mean, unless I get real frustrated.

114
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Shut up.

115
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Please, just shut up.

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I love this noise.

117
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I can't think straight.

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
You're so filthy.

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
It's time to drink your milk.

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Just...

121
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
But you know, when I'm playing video games,

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,260
but you know, when I'm playing video games

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,500
and there are no moral or practical consequences

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
to any of my actions,

125
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,100
I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.

126
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,500
I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,740
doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.

128
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,060
I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life,

129
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,100
and that's fun,

130
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,060
but life itself is terrible.

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:07:10,100
To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.

132
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,460
I'm actually fine.

133
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,900
I have tons of friends.

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,940
I'm fine.

135
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,540
I'm really, I'm fine.

136
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,140
I'm happy, okay?

137
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,300
Here's what I want to know.

138
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,020
Unless violence is fun on some basic level,

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,940
why are simulations of it so fun

140
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,780
that the gameplay of most video games

141
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,380
is based entirely around it?

142
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,500
Some critics have suggested

143
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,060
that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,

144
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,980
and that it's a patriarchal moral defect

145
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,500
that our media is so violent.

146
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,180
And yeah, it's true that men

147
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,820
are mostly responsible for this, granted.

148
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,220
But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,500
by the moral critique,

150
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
since I like violent media,

151
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
and I feel like I can tell the difference

152
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,860
between real and fictional violence.

153
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,380
Although sometimes the distinction

154
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,140
between real and simulated violence

155
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,940
can get blurry.

156
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,540
Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary

157
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,580
The Act of Killing

158
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,180
chronicles the contemporary lives

159
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,540
of the Indonesian gangsters

160
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,700
who massacred millions of alleged communists

161
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,100
from 1965 to 66.

162
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,020
One of the killers, Anwar Kongo,

163
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,860
explains on a local television program

164
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,460
that his torture and murder methods

165
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,780
were inspired by sadistic American movies.

166
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,740
The documentary takes a surreal turn

167
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,020
as the original perpetrator

168
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,260
is set to work producing cinematic reenactments

169
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,700
of their youthful war crimes,

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
stylizing the events after westerns,

171
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,020
mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,780
It's a particularly uncomfortable case

173
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,900
of life imitating art.

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,780
And on that topic,

175
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,460
Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange

176
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,500
withdrawn from British distribution in 1973

177
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,180
after the film was alleged to have influenced

178
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,020
a handful of real life assaults.

179
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,700
Now I'm not saying that violent movies

180
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
make people violent,

181
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,220
and we know that most consumers of violent media

182
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
never commit acts of violence themselves.

183
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,900
I mean, I watch violent movies all the time

184
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.

185
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,900
So now woke ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny.

186
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,060
I personally drowned several of my babies

187
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,300
and it was very traumatic for me.

188
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,460
Why did I become an SJW again?

189
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,220
Hey, what I want to know is

190
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,300
what's the difference between fans of violent movies

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,940
who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers?

192
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,260
Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster

193
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
with a thousand dead communists under his belt?

194
00:09:40,900 --> 00:10:03,460
So in other words,

195
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,140
as long as you can justify it to yourself

196
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,900
with some kind of flimsy excuse,

197
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,500
you can kill without remorse.

198
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
And I imagine it also helps

199
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,460
when the US-backed government of your country

200
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,340
endorses the killing

201
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,500
and you never have to face any consequences for it.

202
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,540
What's interesting to me

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence

204
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,380
is psychologically identical,

205
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,940
whether or not your justification rationally holds up

206
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,220
or makes any sense.

207
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,780
In other words,

208
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,460
the psychology of a righteous sadist

209
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,540
may not differ from that of an evil sadist,

210
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,780
except that the former happens to have better reasons

211
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,580
backing him up,

212
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
or lives in a better political situation.

213
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,300
But hold on,

214
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,860
is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?

215
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,780
I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies,

216
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,740
but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?

217
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,980
What would be helpful here is an example,

218
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,780
some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,

219
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,620
and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.

220
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,060
Unfortunately,

221
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,980
my audience is morally superior,

222
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,500
and none of them would ever enjoy

223
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,500
ContraPoints has completely leapt out

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
and can't stop wringing her hands

225
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,860
over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face.

226
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,260
Alright, alright,

227
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,980
let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.

228
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,900
Let's say it's morally required, even.

229
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,140
Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?

230
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,660
Suppose there's a Nazi TERF

231
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,260
and he's about to punch a baby,

232
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,620
and punching the TERF Nazi

233
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,940
is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.

234
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,900
Socrates,

235
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,140
is it just to punch the baby puncher?

236
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,060
ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize

237
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,660
to the baby community for this video's

238
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,740
ongoing trivialization of infanticide.

239
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,620
They'd also like you to know

240
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,380
that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,

241
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,540
and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.

242
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,220
Why are we even still talking about this

243
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,460
over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?

244
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,860
I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example

245
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,940
of actual far-left violence in America

246
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,620
that anyone seems to be able to dig up.

247
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Not for long, bourgeois dogs!

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,140
Cat girls of the world, unite!

249
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,380
Tabby, could you bring it down

250
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,020
just 27 notches or so?

251
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,020
Why don't you take a second to relax?

252
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,940
Just chill out a little bit.

253
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,700
Here, have some spiked milk.

254
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:18,100
["Russian Queen"]

255
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,660
That is having a very interesting effect on her.

256
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,260
I guess my continued uneasiness

257
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,180
with leftist punching discourse,

258
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,340
whether it's Nazis or TERFs or whatever,

259
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,300
is twofold.

260
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,980
First there's the optics problem.

261
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,500
We want to convince people that,

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,380
for instance,

263
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,900
trans women are not creepy men

264
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,500
who want to assault cis women.

265
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,100
And I can't help but wonder,

266
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,060
is the slogan,

267
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,180
kill all TERFs,

268
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,060
really the most effective way to convey that message?

269
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,580
And I realize the costume I'm wearing

270
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,740
is not the best for making this point either,

271
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,140
but you know, I just didn't plan well.

272
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,020
The other worry has to do with when violence

273
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,740
stops being strategic and starts being fun,

274
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,100
as in our collective enjoyment

275
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,460
of the Richard Spencer punch.

276
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,900
Because then it's not just that we're saying

277
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,740
sometimes preemptive violence is necessary

278
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,180
to prevent worse crimes,

279
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,180
it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.

280
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,820
And anytime real violence becomes fun,

281
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,180
that's a little alarming,

282
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,820
because even if your actions are genuinely justified,

283
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,180
you don't want to get in the habit

284
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,620
of enjoying real violence,

285
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,180
because the violence will continue to be fun

286
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,420
whether or not your justifications are any good.

287
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,700
Though I agree there's something sort of

288
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,580
inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hangup.

289
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,420
For most of history it was just accepted

290
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,900
that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,

291
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,700
and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.

292
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,380
As a boring French postmodernist

293
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,100
called Michael Foucault pointed out,

294
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,700
in the 18th and 19th centuries

295
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,260
there was a so-called humanitarian revolution

296
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,420
that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism

297
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,860
with respect to criminal justice

298
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,380
and treatment of the mentally ill,

299
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,980
replacing brutal executions

300
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,820
with intricate techniques of discipline.

301
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,860
And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou

302
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,900
argued that this contemporary ethics

303
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,580
based on pity and tolerance

304
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,940
is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit

305
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,540
that encourages first world people

306
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,340
to stage third world humanitarian interventions

307
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,580
that look a lot like invasions for some reason,

308
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,660
as well as opposing genuine liberation movements

309
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,860
on the grounds that such movements

310
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,300
amount to violent ideology,

311
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,740
the bourgeois liberals claim.

312
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,300
So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence

313
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,900
benefits the people in power,

314
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,260
since you have to break a few eggs

315
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,860
to make a communist utopia,

316
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
and sometimes to make political progress

317
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
you have to tar and feather some folks

318
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,700
and cut their heads off just a little bit

319
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,300
or punch them in the fucking face.

320
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,380
Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this

321
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,140
are absolutely horrified right now,

322
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,940
and they're thinking,

323
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,700
what's to stop your violent revolution

324
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust

325
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,580
as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists?

326
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,540
To which I respond,

327
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,740
well that's an easy one,

328
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,500
it's because my side are the good people

329
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,860
and your side are the bad people,

330
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm so sorry.

331
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,220
Seriously though, that is a pretty good question.

332
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,660
Why don't I change the subject

333
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,260
to avoid how much of a problem it is

334
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,540
for the argument I'm making?

335
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,180
Isn't all politics kind of violent?

336
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,100
What about capitalism?

337
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,180
Politics is the practice of organizing groups

338
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,140
of human beings,

339
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,500
and it's the relations of power

340
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,900
that maintain or disrupt that organization.

341
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,100
So there's always violence

342
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,940
or the threat of violence in there somewhere.

343
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,140
In our own society,

344
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,740
police will use violence against us

345
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,980
if we disobey the law or are black.

346
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,060
And even when white people do obey the law,

347
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,780
there's always the implicit threat of police violence,

348
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,340
including the potential arrest and incarceration

349
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,700
of pretty much every citizen

350
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,060
who doesn't have enough money to-

351
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,580
Let's talk about western values.

352
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,860
According to the great tradition

353
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,620
of European political thought,

354
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,740
sovereign power is justified by the social contract.

355
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,060
In other words, we all consent to be governed

356
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,820
because it's in our own interest.

357
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,660
Except it's really hypothetical consent

358
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,620
more than anything,

359
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,140
because no one actually asks you,

360
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,980
and you can't say no.

361
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,980
Wait a minute.

362
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,480
Shh!

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,380
I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society,

364
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
it's pretty easy to see how fascism

365
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,020
and revolutionary movements are inherently violent,

366
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,780
and how those political situations

367
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,660
generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish.

368
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,060
What's harder to see is how the same tendency

369
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,180
spills out at the seams

370
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,740
of our own supposedly humane society.

371
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,620
We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers,

372
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,300
yet it's not unheard of that-

373
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,800
Oh.

374
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Oh no.

375
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,740
Oh god.

376
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,900
Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects

377
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,740
or humanitarian interventions,

378
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,780
but when you put real human beings in combat situations,

379
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,940
the nature of war has a way of just-

380
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,440
Oh.

381
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,940
Oh god.

382
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,080
No.

383
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,540
Fuck.

384
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,600
We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,000
but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily

386
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,760
the worst thing that can happen to people.

387
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,160
There's also the quieter structural injustices

388
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
that lead to millions of people starving,

389
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
or workers throwing themselves out of windows

390
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,360
at the iPhone factory,

391
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,840
or the low-key normalization of sexual assault

392
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,680
in supposedly civilized countries,

393
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,800
none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac.

394
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,960
So in order to think about this intelligently,

395
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,200
we need to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence

396
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,840
will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem

397
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,000
against the risk that our own complacency

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,080
with the injustices of the status quo

399
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,560
will make us quiet enablers of more subtle

400
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,640
but equally unjust forms of violence.

401
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,480
And I don't feel confident enough to say

402
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,320
which one I think is the bigger risk,

403
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,800
but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone

404
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,200
who doesn't acknowledge the problems with both options.

405
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,680
So, in conclusion,

406
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
is violence good?

407
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,720
Or is it bad?

408
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,080
I guess we'll never know.

409
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:35,000
You know, with any true philosophical question,

410
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,920
there always comes a point when you realize

411
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,240
that all the rationalizations you tell yourself

412
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,920
for all the things you believe and do

413
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,640
just don't really make any sense.

414
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,120
And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?

415
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,600
Just do the fucking laundry.

416
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,200
Drink some wine.

417
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,720
I don't know.

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,360
Do whatever.

419
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:07,000
Look, what do you want from me?
