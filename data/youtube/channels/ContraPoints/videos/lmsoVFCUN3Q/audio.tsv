49620	53380	So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?
53380	54900	Well, I don't know.
54900	56980	What do I look like to you, some kind of philosopher?
56980	58580	ðŸŽµ
58580	62100	So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,
62100	65380	not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.
65380	67220	ðŸŽµ
67220	70740	However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,
70740	75060	I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,
75620	77860	well, violence is fun.
77860	80340	ðŸŽµ
80340	83780	And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.
83780	86020	It's not fun when other people are violent to you.
86900	89780	I mean, unless that's what you're into.
89780	92100	ðŸŽµ
92100	93700	That is what I'm into.
93700	95300	Did I say you could speak?
95300	96260	No, mistress.
96260	97620	Then shut up!
97620	124740	ðŸŽµ
124740	125700	Mmm, that's good.
126340	127220	Chocolaty.
127220	130660	Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,
130660	133140	and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.
133140	135700	Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.
135700	137700	I mean, if you're going to watch a non-violent movie,
137700	139540	you may as well read a fucking book.
139540	142660	What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to
142660	147300	viddy the old ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,
147300	151780	a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.
151780	155300	What's creepy about Alex is the film encourages us to identify with him,
155460	156980	and he kind of draws us in.
156980	158580	I mean, he listens to Beethoven,
158580	163540	and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.
163540	164900	Also, he tries the wine.
164900	166100	Try the wine!
166100	166660	Shh!
166660	171460	So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people
171460	174580	and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,
174580	177620	and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.
177620	180660	It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.
180660	185060	So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?
185060	187140	How normal is it to enjoy violence?
187140	189780	I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,
189780	193140	but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances
193140	196900	where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.
196900	201620	And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience,
201620	205220	and I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy
205220	206660	watching A Clockwork Orange.
206660	208420	It's not that they don't enjoy violence,
208420	210500	it's that in order for them to enjoy violence,
210500	213300	they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,
213300	216020	and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.
220580	222180	I guess it's kind of like sex.
222180	225380	I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.
225380	227460	At least, not since I started taking this shit.
227460	229460	I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know.
229460	231140	A little goddamn ambiance.
231140	233460	And you could say that the moral conscience
233460	236660	is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.
236660	238500	You can't properly enjoy violence
238500	241300	with all that internal nagging going on in the background.
241300	242260	But in that case,
242260	245540	what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?
245540	248820	What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?
248820	251940	Well, think about the TV show Law & Order SVU,
251940	254900	which has just as much sex and violence as A Clockwork Orange,
254900	256820	but which is much more popular.
256820	260260	SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process
260260	262660	brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders
262660	264820	and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.
267060	268340	You like that, don't you?
268340	269860	I love it so much.
269860	271220	You all do.
271220	272900	I think a lot of the appeal of SVU
272900	275140	is that it gives upstanding American citizens
275140	278340	a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes
278340	280420	while promising the moral purification
280420	282340	of justified police violence.
282340	285540	Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance
285540	286740	of the moral psyche.
286740	289380	When we believe that violence is morally justified,
289380	291940	when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room
291940	293060	fucking deserved it,
293060	295620	we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.
295620	296420	Exactly.
296420	298500	And I think this kind of moral lampshading
298500	301940	partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines
301940	304260	you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow,
304260	306420	and Curious George Kills the Rapist.
306420	308180	For viewers with too many moral hangups
308180	310340	to get off on totally senseless violence,
310340	312340	a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way
312340	314260	to establish the emotional precedent
314260	316580	required for gratifying bloody payoff.
316580	317940	But I wonder if there may not be
317940	319620	as much of a psychological difference
319620	322500	between the good person's enjoyment of justified violence
322500	324900	and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random violence
324900	326340	as we might like to think.
326340	328740	Yes, the good person has a moral conscience
328740	330580	as a kind of inhibitive influence,
330580	332020	but once you get past that,
332020	334580	there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture
334580	338260	in swinging, thrashing, stabbing, shooting,
338260	339780	blasting, and burning,
339780	342420	an aesthetics of violence and destruction.
342420	345220	Now I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence
345220	347060	because I empathize with the victim
347060	349860	and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.
349860	351940	I mean, unless I get real frustrated.
352500	354500	Shut up.
354500	356500	Please, just shut up.
356500	358500	I love this noise.
358500	360500	I can't think straight.
360500	362500	You're so filthy.
362500	364500	It's time to drink your milk.
364500	366500	Just...
378500	380500	But you know, when I'm playing video games,
380500	382260	but you know, when I'm playing video games
382260	384500	and there are no moral or practical consequences
384500	385700	to any of my actions,
385700	388100	I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.
390260	392500	I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun
392500	394740	doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.
394740	397060	I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life,
397060	398100	and that's fun,
398100	401060	but life itself is terrible.
410500	430100	To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.
430100	431460	I'm actually fine.
431460	432900	I have tons of friends.
432900	433940	I'm fine.
433940	435540	I'm really, I'm fine.
436100	437140	I'm happy, okay?
437940	439300	Here's what I want to know.
439300	442020	Unless violence is fun on some basic level,
442020	443940	why are simulations of it so fun
443940	445780	that the gameplay of most video games
445780	447380	is based entirely around it?
447380	448500	Some critics have suggested
448500	451060	that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,
451060	452980	and that it's a patriarchal moral defect
452980	454500	that our media is so violent.
454500	456180	And yeah, it's true that men
456180	458820	are mostly responsible for this, granted.
458820	461220	But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized
461220	462500	by the moral critique,
462500	464100	since I like violent media,
464100	465700	and I feel like I can tell the difference
465700	467860	between real and fictional violence.
467860	469380	Although sometimes the distinction
469380	471140	between real and simulated violence
471140	471940	can get blurry.
483300	485540	Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary
485540	486580	The Act of Killing
486580	488180	chronicles the contemporary lives
488180	489540	of the Indonesian gangsters
489540	491700	who massacred millions of alleged communists
491700	494100	from 1965 to 66.
494100	496020	One of the killers, Anwar Kongo,
496020	497860	explains on a local television program
497860	499460	that his torture and murder methods
499460	501780	were inspired by sadistic American movies.
517060	518740	The documentary takes a surreal turn
518740	520020	as the original perpetrator
520020	522260	is set to work producing cinematic reenactments
522260	523700	of their youthful war crimes,
523700	525700	stylizing the events after westerns,
525700	528020	mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.
528020	529780	It's a particularly uncomfortable case
529780	530900	of life imitating art.
530900	531780	And on that topic,
531780	533460	Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange
533460	536500	withdrawn from British distribution in 1973
536500	538180	after the film was alleged to have influenced
538180	540020	a handful of real life assaults.
540020	541700	Now I'm not saying that violent movies
541700	542900	make people violent,
542900	545220	and we know that most consumers of violent media
545220	547220	never commit acts of violence themselves.
547220	548900	I mean, I watch violent movies all the time
548900	550900	and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
550900	556900	So now woke ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny.
556900	559060	I personally drowned several of my babies
559060	561300	and it was very traumatic for me.
561300	563460	Why did I become an SJW again?
563460	565220	Hey, what I want to know is
565220	567300	what's the difference between fans of violent movies
567300	569940	who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers?
569940	572260	Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster
572260	574260	with a thousand dead communists under his belt?
580900	603460	So in other words,
603460	605140	as long as you can justify it to yourself
605140	606900	with some kind of flimsy excuse,
606900	608500	you can kill without remorse.
608500	609700	And I imagine it also helps
609700	611460	when the US-backed government of your country
611460	612340	endorses the killing
612340	614500	and you never have to face any consequences for it.
614500	615540	What's interesting to me
615540	617540	is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence
617540	619380	is psychologically identical,
619380	621940	whether or not your justification rationally holds up
621940	623220	or makes any sense.
623220	623780	In other words,
623780	625460	the psychology of a righteous sadist
625460	627540	may not differ from that of an evil sadist,
627540	629780	except that the former happens to have better reasons
629780	630580	backing him up,
630580	632580	or lives in a better political situation.
632580	633300	But hold on,
633300	635860	is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?
635860	637780	I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies,
637780	640740	but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?
640740	642980	What would be helpful here is an example,
642980	645780	some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,
645780	647620	and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.
648180	649060	Unfortunately,
649060	650980	my audience is morally superior,
650980	652500	and none of them would ever enjoy
662100	664500	ContraPoints has completely leapt out
664500	666500	and can't stop wringing her hands
666580	669860	over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face.
671140	672260	Alright, alright,
672260	674980	let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.
674980	676900	Let's say it's morally required, even.
676900	679140	Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?
679140	680660	Suppose there's a Nazi TERF
680660	682260	and he's about to punch a baby,
682260	683620	and punching the TERF Nazi
683620	685940	is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.
685940	686900	Socrates,
686900	689140	is it just to punch the baby puncher?
689140	691060	ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize
691060	692660	to the baby community for this video's
692660	694740	ongoing trivialization of infanticide.
694740	695620	They'd also like you to know
695620	697380	that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,
697380	699540	and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.
699540	701220	Why are we even still talking about this
701220	703460	over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?
703460	705860	I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example
705860	707940	of actual far-left violence in America
707940	709620	that anyone seems to be able to dig up.
710580	713220	Not for long, bourgeois dogs!
713220	715140	Cat girls of the world, unite!
715860	717380	Tabby, could you bring it down
718100	720020	just 27 notches or so?
722180	724020	Why don't you take a second to relax?
724020	725940	Just chill out a little bit.
725940	727700	Here, have some spiked milk.
727700	738100	["Russian Queen"]
738100	740660	That is having a very interesting effect on her.
740660	742260	I guess my continued uneasiness
742260	744180	with leftist punching discourse,
744180	746340	whether it's Nazis or TERFs or whatever,
746340	747300	is twofold.
747300	748980	First there's the optics problem.
748980	750500	We want to convince people that,
750500	751380	for instance,
751380	752900	trans women are not creepy men
752900	754500	who want to assault cis women.
754500	756100	And I can't help but wonder,
756100	757060	is the slogan,
757060	758180	kill all TERFs,
758820	761060	really the most effective way to convey that message?
762500	764580	And I realize the costume I'm wearing
764580	766740	is not the best for making this point either,
766740	769140	but you know, I just didn't plan well.
769940	772020	The other worry has to do with when violence
772020	774740	stops being strategic and starts being fun,
774740	776100	as in our collective enjoyment
776100	777460	of the Richard Spencer punch.
777460	778900	Because then it's not just that we're saying
778900	780740	sometimes preemptive violence is necessary
780740	782180	to prevent worse crimes,
782180	784180	it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.
784180	786820	And anytime real violence becomes fun,
786820	788180	that's a little alarming,
788180	790820	because even if your actions are genuinely justified,
790820	792180	you don't want to get in the habit
792180	793620	of enjoying real violence,
793620	796180	because the violence will continue to be fun
796180	798420	whether or not your justifications are any good.
798420	799700	Though I agree there's something sort of
799700	802580	inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hangup.
802580	804420	For most of history it was just accepted
804420	806900	that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,
806900	809700	and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.
809700	811380	As a boring French postmodernist
811380	814100	called Michael Foucault pointed out,
814100	815700	in the 18th and 19th centuries
815700	818260	there was a so-called humanitarian revolution
818260	820420	that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism
820420	821860	with respect to criminal justice
821860	823380	and treatment of the mentally ill,
823380	824980	replacing brutal executions
824980	826820	with intricate techniques of discipline.
826820	829860	And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou
831060	832900	argued that this contemporary ethics
832900	834580	based on pity and tolerance
834580	837940	is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit
838020	839540	that encourages first world people
839540	842340	to stage third world humanitarian interventions
842340	844580	that look a lot like invasions for some reason,
844580	846660	as well as opposing genuine liberation movements
846660	847860	on the grounds that such movements
847860	849300	amount to violent ideology,
849300	850740	the bourgeois liberals claim.
850740	853300	So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence
853300	854900	benefits the people in power,
854900	856260	since you have to break a few eggs
856260	857860	to make a communist utopia,
857860	859860	and sometimes to make political progress
859860	861860	you have to tar and feather some folks
861860	863700	and cut their heads off just a little bit
863700	865300	or punch them in the fucking face.
865300	867380	Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this
867380	869140	are absolutely horrified right now,
869140	869940	and they're thinking,
869940	871700	what's to stop your violent revolution
871700	874100	from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust
874100	876580	as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists?
876580	877540	To which I respond,
877540	878740	well that's an easy one,
878740	880500	it's because my side are the good people
880500	881860	and your side are the bad people,
881860	882980	I'm so sorry.
882980	885220	Seriously though, that is a pretty good question.
885220	886660	Why don't I change the subject
886660	888260	to avoid how much of a problem it is
888260	889540	for the argument I'm making?
890100	892180	Isn't all politics kind of violent?
892180	894100	What about capitalism?
894100	896180	Politics is the practice of organizing groups
896180	897140	of human beings,
897140	898500	and it's the relations of power
898500	900900	that maintain or disrupt that organization.
900900	902100	So there's always violence
902100	903940	or the threat of violence in there somewhere.
903940	905140	In our own society,
905140	906740	police will use violence against us
906740	908980	if we disobey the law or are black.
908980	911060	And even when white people do obey the law,
911060	913780	there's always the implicit threat of police violence,
913780	916340	including the potential arrest and incarceration
916340	917700	of pretty much every citizen
917700	919060	who doesn't have enough money to-
919060	922580	Let's talk about western values.
922580	923860	According to the great tradition
923860	925620	of European political thought,
925620	928740	sovereign power is justified by the social contract.
928740	931060	In other words, we all consent to be governed
931060	932820	because it's in our own interest.
932820	934660	Except it's really hypothetical consent
934660	935620	more than anything,
935620	937140	because no one actually asks you,
937700	938980	and you can't say no.
940180	940980	Wait a minute.
940980	941480	Shh!
942420	945380	I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society,
945380	947380	it's pretty easy to see how fascism
947380	950020	and revolutionary movements are inherently violent,
950020	951780	and how those political situations
951780	954660	generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish.
954740	957060	What's harder to see is how the same tendency
957060	958180	spills out at the seams
958180	960740	of our own supposedly humane society.
960740	963620	We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers,
963620	965300	yet it's not unheard of that-
965300	965800	Oh.
966580	967220	Oh no.
968020	968740	Oh god.
970020	972900	Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects
972900	974740	or humanitarian interventions,
974740	977780	but when you put real human beings in combat situations,
977780	979940	the nature of war has a way of just-
979940	980440	Oh.
981060	981940	Oh god.
982580	983080	No.
984040	984540	Fuck.
985240	988600	We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,
988600	991000	but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily
991000	992760	the worst thing that can happen to people.
992760	995160	There's also the quieter structural injustices
995160	997160	that lead to millions of people starving,
997160	999160	or workers throwing themselves out of windows
999160	1000360	at the iPhone factory,
1000360	1002840	or the low-key normalization of sexual assault
1002840	1004680	in supposedly civilized countries,
1004680	1007800	none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac.
1007800	1009960	So in order to think about this intelligently,
1009960	1012200	we need to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence
1012200	1014840	will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem
1014840	1017000	against the risk that our own complacency
1017000	1019080	with the injustices of the status quo
1019080	1021560	will make us quiet enablers of more subtle
1021560	1023640	but equally unjust forms of violence.
1023640	1025480	And I don't feel confident enough to say
1025480	1027320	which one I think is the bigger risk,
1027320	1029800	but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone
1029800	1032200	who doesn't acknowledge the problems with both options.
1032760	1034680	So, in conclusion,
1034680	1035720	is violence good?
1036360	1037720	Or is it bad?
1037720	1039080	I guess we'll never know.
1042440	1055000	You know, with any true philosophical question,
1055000	1056920	there always comes a point when you realize
1056920	1059240	that all the rationalizations you tell yourself
1059240	1060920	for all the things you believe and do
1060920	1063640	just don't really make any sense.
1063640	1066120	And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?
1066760	1068600	Just do the fucking laundry.
1069320	1070200	Drink some wine.
1071160	1071720	I don't know.
1071720	1072360	Do whatever.
1073160	1087000	Look, what do you want from me?
