00:00.000 --> 00:26.500
ðŸŽµ

00:26.500 --> 00:49.620
ðŸŽµ

00:49.620 --> 00:53.380
So why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other?

00:53.380 --> 00:54.900
Well, I don't know.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.980
What do I look like to you, some kind of philosopher?

00:56.980 --> 00:58.580
ðŸŽµ

00:58.580 --> 01:02.100
So look, Thrasymachus, this is a question for God and the prophets,

01:02.100 --> 01:05.380
not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a Bloody Mary.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.220
ðŸŽµ

01:07.220 --> 01:10.740
However, if I were to make a modest contribution to the subject,

01:10.740 --> 01:15.060
I would humbly offer up the hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because,

01:15.620 --> 01:17.860
well, violence is fun.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.340
ðŸŽµ

01:20.340 --> 01:23.780
And when I say that, I of course mean that it's fun to be violent.

01:23.780 --> 01:26.020
It's not fun when other people are violent to you.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.780
I mean, unless that's what you're into.

01:29.780 --> 01:32.100
ðŸŽµ

01:32.100 --> 01:33.700
That is what I'm into.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.300
Did I say you could speak?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.260
No, mistress.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.620
Then shut up!

01:37.620 --> 02:04.740
ðŸŽµ

02:04.740 --> 02:05.700
Mmm, that's good.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.220
Chocolaty.

02:07.220 --> 02:10.660
Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is very uncomfortable to watch,

02:10.660 --> 02:13.140
and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence.

02:13.140 --> 02:15.700
Most of the movies I like depict horrible acts of violence.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.700
I mean, if you're going to watch a non-violent movie,

02:17.700 --> 02:19.540
you may as well read a fucking book.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.660
What's disquieting about A Clockwork Orange is that it encourages us to

02:22.660 --> 02:27.300
viddy the old ultra-violence largely from the perspective of the sadistic protagonist,

02:27.300 --> 02:31.780
a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims.

02:31.780 --> 02:35.300
What's creepy about Alex is the film encourages us to identify with him,

02:35.460 --> 02:36.980
and he kind of draws us in.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.580
I mean, he listens to Beethoven,

02:38.580 --> 02:43.540
and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever liked German composers.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.900
Also, he tries the wine.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.100
Try the wine!

02:46.100 --> 02:46.660
Shh!

02:46.660 --> 02:51.460
So we watch Alex kick and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people

02:51.460 --> 02:54.580
and bash old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks,

02:54.580 --> 02:57.620
and all of this to triumphant classical music and show tunes.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.660
It's clear that for Alex, this is all a lot of fun.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.060
So the question I want to ask is, how unusual are people like this in real life?

03:05.060 --> 03:07.140
How normal is it to enjoy violence?

03:07.140 --> 03:09.780
I mean, extremely violent behavior is uncommon,

03:09.780 --> 03:13.140
but part of that might be that most of us live in political circumstances

03:13.140 --> 03:16.900
where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned upon.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.620
And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a moral conscience,

03:21.620 --> 03:25.220
and I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy

03:25.220 --> 03:26.660
watching A Clockwork Orange.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.420
It's not that they don't enjoy violence,

03:28.420 --> 03:30.500
it's that in order for them to enjoy violence,

03:30.500 --> 03:33.300
they need some kind of reassurance that the violence is okay,

03:33.300 --> 03:36.020
and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.180
I guess it's kind of like sex.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.380
I'm not going to want to have sex in a fluorescent-lit bathroom stall.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.460
At least, not since I started taking this shit.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.460
I need candlelight to get me in the mood, you know.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.140
A little goddamn ambiance.

03:51.140 --> 03:53.460
And you could say that the moral conscience

03:53.460 --> 03:56.660
is the fluorescent-lit bathroom stall of the human mind.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.500
You can't properly enjoy violence

03:58.500 --> 04:01.300
with all that internal nagging going on in the background.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.260
But in that case,

04:02.260 --> 04:05.540
what is the romantic candlelight of the sadistic psyche?

04:05.540 --> 04:08.820
What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy violence?

04:08.820 --> 04:11.940
Well, think about the TV show Law & Order SVU,

04:11.940 --> 04:14.900
which has just as much sex and violence as A Clockwork Orange,

04:14.900 --> 04:16.820
but which is much more popular.

04:16.820 --> 04:20.260
SVU is a show where hero cops with no regard for due process

04:20.260 --> 04:22.660
brutally interrogate suspected sex offenders

04:22.660 --> 04:24.820
and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.340
You like that, don't you?

04:28.340 --> 04:29.860
I love it so much.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.220
You all do.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.900
I think a lot of the appeal of SVU

04:32.900 --> 04:35.140
is that it gives upstanding American citizens

04:35.140 --> 04:38.340
a way to sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes

04:38.340 --> 04:40.420
while promising the moral purification

04:40.420 --> 04:42.340
of justified police violence.

04:42.340 --> 04:45.540
Oh, so that promise is the candlelit ambiance

04:45.540 --> 04:46.740
of the moral psyche.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.380
When we believe that violence is morally justified,

04:49.380 --> 04:51.940
when we think the guy being thrown around the interrogation room

04:51.940 --> 04:53.060
fucking deserved it,

04:53.060 --> 04:55.620
we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.

04:55.620 --> 04:56.420
Exactly.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.500
And I think this kind of moral lampshading

04:58.500 --> 05:01.940
partly explains the popularity of rape-revenge plotlines

05:01.940 --> 05:04.260
you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow,

05:04.260 --> 05:06.420
and Curious George Kills the Rapist.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.180
For viewers with too many moral hangups

05:08.180 --> 05:10.340
to get off on totally senseless violence,

05:10.340 --> 05:12.340
a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way

05:12.340 --> 05:14.260
to establish the emotional precedent

05:14.260 --> 05:16.580
required for gratifying bloody payoff.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.940
But I wonder if there may not be

05:17.940 --> 05:19.620
as much of a psychological difference

05:19.620 --> 05:22.500
between the good person's enjoyment of justified violence

05:22.500 --> 05:24.900
and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random violence

05:24.900 --> 05:26.340
as we might like to think.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.740
Yes, the good person has a moral conscience

05:28.740 --> 05:30.580
as a kind of inhibitive influence,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.020
but once you get past that,

05:32.020 --> 05:34.580
there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture

05:34.580 --> 05:38.260
in swinging, thrashing, stabbing, shooting,

05:38.260 --> 05:39.780
blasting, and burning,

05:39.780 --> 05:42.420
an aesthetics of violence and destruction.

05:42.420 --> 05:45.220
Now I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence

05:45.220 --> 05:47.060
because I empathize with the victim

05:47.060 --> 05:49.860
and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.

05:49.860 --> 05:51.940
I mean, unless I get real frustrated.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
Shut up.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
Please, just shut up.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
I love this noise.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.500
I can't think straight.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
You're so filthy.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
It's time to drink your milk.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
Just...

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
But you know, when I'm playing video games,

06:20.500 --> 06:22.260
but you know, when I'm playing video games

06:22.260 --> 06:24.500
and there are no moral or practical consequences

06:24.500 --> 06:25.700
to any of my actions,

06:25.700 --> 06:28.100
I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.500
I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun

06:32.500 --> 06:34.740
doesn't mean that the thing itself is fun.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.060
I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life,

06:37.060 --> 06:38.100
and that's fun,

06:38.100 --> 06:41.060
but life itself is terrible.

06:50.500 --> 07:10.100
To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.460
I'm actually fine.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.900
I have tons of friends.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.940
I'm fine.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.540
I'm really, I'm fine.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.140
I'm happy, okay?

07:17.940 --> 07:19.300
Here's what I want to know.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.020
Unless violence is fun on some basic level,

07:22.020 --> 07:23.940
why are simulations of it so fun

07:23.940 --> 07:25.780
that the gameplay of most video games

07:25.780 --> 07:27.380
is based entirely around it?

07:27.380 --> 07:28.500
Some critics have suggested

07:28.500 --> 07:31.060
that this is simply toxic masculinity at work,

07:31.060 --> 07:32.980
and that it's a patriarchal moral defect

07:32.980 --> 07:34.500
that our media is so violent.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.180
And yeah, it's true that men

07:36.180 --> 07:38.820
are mostly responsible for this, granted.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.220
But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized

07:41.220 --> 07:42.500
by the moral critique,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.100
since I like violent media,

07:44.100 --> 07:45.700
and I feel like I can tell the difference

07:45.700 --> 07:47.860
between real and fictional violence.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.380
Although sometimes the distinction

07:49.380 --> 07:51.140
between real and simulated violence

07:51.140 --> 07:51.940
can get blurry.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.540
Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary

08:05.540 --> 08:06.580
The Act of Killing

08:06.580 --> 08:08.180
chronicles the contemporary lives

08:08.180 --> 08:09.540
of the Indonesian gangsters

08:09.540 --> 08:11.700
who massacred millions of alleged communists

08:11.700 --> 08:14.100
from 1965 to 66.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.020
One of the killers, Anwar Kongo,

08:16.020 --> 08:17.860
explains on a local television program

08:17.860 --> 08:19.460
that his torture and murder methods

08:19.460 --> 08:21.780
were inspired by sadistic American movies.

08:37.060 --> 08:38.740
The documentary takes a surreal turn

08:38.740 --> 08:40.020
as the original perpetrator

08:40.020 --> 08:42.260
is set to work producing cinematic reenactments

08:42.260 --> 08:43.700
of their youthful war crimes,

08:43.700 --> 08:45.700
stylizing the events after westerns,

08:45.700 --> 08:48.020
mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.780
It's a particularly uncomfortable case

08:49.780 --> 08:50.900
of life imitating art.

08:50.900 --> 08:51.780
And on that topic,

08:51.780 --> 08:53.460
Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange

08:53.460 --> 08:56.500
withdrawn from British distribution in 1973

08:56.500 --> 08:58.180
after the film was alleged to have influenced

08:58.180 --> 09:00.020
a handful of real life assaults.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.700
Now I'm not saying that violent movies

09:01.700 --> 09:02.900
make people violent,

09:02.900 --> 09:05.220
and we know that most consumers of violent media

09:05.220 --> 09:07.220
never commit acts of violence themselves.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.900
I mean, I watch violent movies all the time

09:08.900 --> 09:10.900
and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.

09:10.900 --> 09:16.900
So now woke ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.060
I personally drowned several of my babies

09:19.060 --> 09:21.300
and it was very traumatic for me.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.460
Why did I become an SJW again?

09:23.460 --> 09:25.220
Hey, what I want to know is

09:25.220 --> 09:27.300
what's the difference between fans of violent movies

09:27.300 --> 09:29.940
who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers?

09:29.940 --> 09:32.260
Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster

09:32.260 --> 09:34.260
with a thousand dead communists under his belt?

09:40.900 --> 10:03.460
So in other words,

10:03.460 --> 10:05.140
as long as you can justify it to yourself

10:05.140 --> 10:06.900
with some kind of flimsy excuse,

10:06.900 --> 10:08.500
you can kill without remorse.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.700
And I imagine it also helps

10:09.700 --> 10:11.460
when the US-backed government of your country

10:11.460 --> 10:12.340
endorses the killing

10:12.340 --> 10:14.500
and you never have to face any consequences for it.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.540
What's interesting to me

10:15.540 --> 10:17.540
is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence

10:17.540 --> 10:19.380
is psychologically identical,

10:19.380 --> 10:21.940
whether or not your justification rationally holds up

10:21.940 --> 10:23.220
or makes any sense.

10:23.220 --> 10:23.780
In other words,

10:23.780 --> 10:25.460
the psychology of a righteous sadist

10:25.460 --> 10:27.540
may not differ from that of an evil sadist,

10:27.540 --> 10:29.780
except that the former happens to have better reasons

10:29.780 --> 10:30.580
backing him up,

10:30.580 --> 10:32.580
or lives in a better political situation.

10:32.580 --> 10:33.300
But hold on,

10:33.300 --> 10:35.860
is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?

10:35.860 --> 10:37.780
I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies,

10:37.780 --> 10:40.740
but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?

10:40.740 --> 10:42.980
What would be helpful here is an example,

10:42.980 --> 10:45.780
some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,

10:45.780 --> 10:47.620
and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.060
Unfortunately,

10:49.060 --> 10:50.980
my audience is morally superior,

10:50.980 --> 10:52.500
and none of them would ever enjoy

11:02.100 --> 11:04.500
ContraPoints has completely leapt out

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
and can't stop wringing her hands

11:06.580 --> 11:09.860
over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.260
Alright, alright,

11:12.260 --> 11:14.980
let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.900
Let's say it's morally required, even.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.140
Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?

11:19.140 --> 11:20.660
Suppose there's a Nazi TERF

11:20.660 --> 11:22.260
and he's about to punch a baby,

11:22.260 --> 11:23.620
and punching the TERF Nazi

11:23.620 --> 11:25.940
is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.

11:25.940 --> 11:26.900
Socrates,

11:26.900 --> 11:29.140
is it just to punch the baby puncher?

11:29.140 --> 11:31.060
ContraPoints sponsors would like to apologize

11:31.060 --> 11:32.660
to the baby community for this video's

11:32.660 --> 11:34.740
ongoing trivialization of infanticide.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.620
They'd also like you to know

11:35.620 --> 11:37.380
that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,

11:37.380 --> 11:39.540
and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.220
Why are we even still talking about this

11:41.220 --> 11:43.460
over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?

11:43.460 --> 11:45.860
I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example

11:45.860 --> 11:47.940
of actual far-left violence in America

11:47.940 --> 11:49.620
that anyone seems to be able to dig up.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.220
Not for long, bourgeois dogs!

11:53.220 --> 11:55.140
Cat girls of the world, unite!

11:55.860 --> 11:57.380
Tabby, could you bring it down

11:58.100 --> 12:00.020
just 27 notches or so?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.020
Why don't you take a second to relax?

12:04.020 --> 12:05.940
Just chill out a little bit.

12:05.940 --> 12:07.700
Here, have some spiked milk.

12:07.700 --> 12:18.100
["Russian Queen"]

12:18.100 --> 12:20.660
That is having a very interesting effect on her.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.260
I guess my continued uneasiness

12:22.260 --> 12:24.180
with leftist punching discourse,

12:24.180 --> 12:26.340
whether it's Nazis or TERFs or whatever,

12:26.340 --> 12:27.300
is twofold.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.980
First there's the optics problem.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.500
We want to convince people that,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.380
for instance,

12:31.380 --> 12:32.900
trans women are not creepy men

12:32.900 --> 12:34.500
who want to assault cis women.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.100
And I can't help but wonder,

12:36.100 --> 12:37.060
is the slogan,

12:37.060 --> 12:38.180
kill all TERFs,

12:38.820 --> 12:41.060
really the most effective way to convey that message?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.580
And I realize the costume I'm wearing

12:44.580 --> 12:46.740
is not the best for making this point either,

12:46.740 --> 12:49.140
but you know, I just didn't plan well.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.020
The other worry has to do with when violence

12:52.020 --> 12:54.740
stops being strategic and starts being fun,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.100
as in our collective enjoyment

12:56.100 --> 12:57.460
of the Richard Spencer punch.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.900
Because then it's not just that we're saying

12:58.900 --> 13:00.740
sometimes preemptive violence is necessary

13:00.740 --> 13:02.180
to prevent worse crimes,

13:02.180 --> 13:04.180
it's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.820
And anytime real violence becomes fun,

13:06.820 --> 13:08.180
that's a little alarming,

13:08.180 --> 13:10.820
because even if your actions are genuinely justified,

13:10.820 --> 13:12.180
you don't want to get in the habit

13:12.180 --> 13:13.620
of enjoying real violence,

13:13.620 --> 13:16.180
because the violence will continue to be fun

13:16.180 --> 13:18.420
whether or not your justifications are any good.

13:18.420 --> 13:19.700
Though I agree there's something sort of

13:19.700 --> 13:22.580
inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hangup.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.420
For most of history it was just accepted

13:24.420 --> 13:26.900
that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,

13:26.900 --> 13:29.700
and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.380
As a boring French postmodernist

13:31.380 --> 13:34.100
called Michael Foucault pointed out,

13:34.100 --> 13:35.700
in the 18th and 19th centuries

13:35.700 --> 13:38.260
there was a so-called humanitarian revolution

13:38.260 --> 13:40.420
that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism

13:40.420 --> 13:41.860
with respect to criminal justice

13:41.860 --> 13:43.380
and treatment of the mentally ill,

13:43.380 --> 13:44.980
replacing brutal executions

13:44.980 --> 13:46.820
with intricate techniques of discipline.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.860
And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou

13:51.060 --> 13:52.900
argued that this contemporary ethics

13:52.900 --> 13:54.580
based on pity and tolerance

13:54.580 --> 13:57.940
is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit

13:58.020 --> 13:59.540
that encourages first world people

13:59.540 --> 14:02.340
to stage third world humanitarian interventions

14:02.340 --> 14:04.580
that look a lot like invasions for some reason,

14:04.580 --> 14:06.660
as well as opposing genuine liberation movements

14:06.660 --> 14:07.860
on the grounds that such movements

14:07.860 --> 14:09.300
amount to violent ideology,

14:09.300 --> 14:10.740
the bourgeois liberals claim.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.300
So I guess in a sense my weird hangup about violence

14:13.300 --> 14:14.900
benefits the people in power,

14:14.900 --> 14:16.260
since you have to break a few eggs

14:16.260 --> 14:17.860
to make a communist utopia,

14:17.860 --> 14:19.860
and sometimes to make political progress

14:19.860 --> 14:21.860
you have to tar and feather some folks

14:21.860 --> 14:23.700
and cut their heads off just a little bit

14:23.700 --> 14:25.300
or punch them in the fucking face.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.380
Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this

14:27.380 --> 14:29.140
are absolutely horrified right now,

14:29.140 --> 14:29.940
and they're thinking,

14:29.940 --> 14:31.700
what's to stop your violent revolution

14:31.700 --> 14:34.100
from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust

14:34.100 --> 14:36.580
as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists?

14:36.580 --> 14:37.540
To which I respond,

14:37.540 --> 14:38.740
well that's an easy one,

14:38.740 --> 14:40.500
it's because my side are the good people

14:40.500 --> 14:41.860
and your side are the bad people,

14:41.860 --> 14:42.980
I'm so sorry.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.220
Seriously though, that is a pretty good question.

14:45.220 --> 14:46.660
Why don't I change the subject

14:46.660 --> 14:48.260
to avoid how much of a problem it is

14:48.260 --> 14:49.540
for the argument I'm making?

14:50.100 --> 14:52.180
Isn't all politics kind of violent?

14:52.180 --> 14:54.100
What about capitalism?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.180
Politics is the practice of organizing groups

14:56.180 --> 14:57.140
of human beings,

14:57.140 --> 14:58.500
and it's the relations of power

14:58.500 --> 15:00.900
that maintain or disrupt that organization.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.100
So there's always violence

15:02.100 --> 15:03.940
or the threat of violence in there somewhere.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.140
In our own society,

15:05.140 --> 15:06.740
police will use violence against us

15:06.740 --> 15:08.980
if we disobey the law or are black.

15:08.980 --> 15:11.060
And even when white people do obey the law,

15:11.060 --> 15:13.780
there's always the implicit threat of police violence,

15:13.780 --> 15:16.340
including the potential arrest and incarceration

15:16.340 --> 15:17.700
of pretty much every citizen

15:17.700 --> 15:19.060
who doesn't have enough money to-

15:19.060 --> 15:22.580
Let's talk about western values.

15:22.580 --> 15:23.860
According to the great tradition

15:23.860 --> 15:25.620
of European political thought,

15:25.620 --> 15:28.740
sovereign power is justified by the social contract.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.060
In other words, we all consent to be governed

15:31.060 --> 15:32.820
because it's in our own interest.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.660
Except it's really hypothetical consent

15:34.660 --> 15:35.620
more than anything,

15:35.620 --> 15:37.140
because no one actually asks you,

15:37.700 --> 15:38.980
and you can't say no.

15:40.180 --> 15:40.980
Wait a minute.

15:40.980 --> 15:41.480
Shh!

15:42.420 --> 15:45.380
I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society,

15:45.380 --> 15:47.380
it's pretty easy to see how fascism

15:47.380 --> 15:50.020
and revolutionary movements are inherently violent,

15:50.020 --> 15:51.780
and how those political situations

15:51.780 --> 15:54.660
generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish.

15:54.740 --> 15:57.060
What's harder to see is how the same tendency

15:57.060 --> 15:58.180
spills out at the seams

15:58.180 --> 16:00.740
of our own supposedly humane society.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.620
We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers,

16:03.620 --> 16:05.300
yet it's not unheard of that-

16:05.300 --> 16:05.800
Oh.

16:06.580 --> 16:07.220
Oh no.

16:08.020 --> 16:08.740
Oh god.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.900
Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects

16:12.900 --> 16:14.740
or humanitarian interventions,

16:14.740 --> 16:17.780
but when you put real human beings in combat situations,

16:17.780 --> 16:19.940
the nature of war has a way of just-

16:19.940 --> 16:20.440
Oh.

16:21.060 --> 16:21.940
Oh god.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.080
No.

16:24.040 --> 16:24.540
Fuck.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.600
We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgment on sadism,

16:28.600 --> 16:31.000
but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily

16:31.000 --> 16:32.760
the worst thing that can happen to people.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.160
There's also the quieter structural injustices

16:35.160 --> 16:37.160
that lead to millions of people starving,

16:37.160 --> 16:39.160
or workers throwing themselves out of windows

16:39.160 --> 16:40.360
at the iPhone factory,

16:40.360 --> 16:42.840
or the low-key normalization of sexual assault

16:42.840 --> 16:44.680
in supposedly civilized countries,

16:44.680 --> 16:47.800
none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.960
So in order to think about this intelligently,

16:49.960 --> 16:52.200
we need to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence

16:52.200 --> 16:54.840
will spin out of control and lead to sadistic mayhem

16:54.840 --> 16:57.000
against the risk that our own complacency

16:57.000 --> 16:59.080
with the injustices of the status quo

16:59.080 --> 17:01.560
will make us quiet enablers of more subtle

17:01.560 --> 17:03.640
but equally unjust forms of violence.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.480
And I don't feel confident enough to say

17:05.480 --> 17:07.320
which one I think is the bigger risk,

17:07.320 --> 17:09.800
but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone

17:09.800 --> 17:12.200
who doesn't acknowledge the problems with both options.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.680
So, in conclusion,

17:14.680 --> 17:15.720
is violence good?

17:16.360 --> 17:17.720
Or is it bad?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.080
I guess we'll never know.

17:22.440 --> 17:35.000
You know, with any true philosophical question,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.920
there always comes a point when you realize

17:36.920 --> 17:39.240
that all the rationalizations you tell yourself

17:39.240 --> 17:40.920
for all the things you believe and do

17:40.920 --> 17:43.640
just don't really make any sense.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.120
And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.600
Just do the fucking laundry.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.200
Drink some wine.

17:51.160 --> 17:51.720
I don't know.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.360
Do whatever.

17:53.160 --> 18:07.000
Look, what do you want from me?
