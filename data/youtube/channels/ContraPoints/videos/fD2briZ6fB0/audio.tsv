0	7860	Imagine how a woman feels.
7860	11240	Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels.
11240	14300	Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume.
14300	18960	Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours.
18960	24320	Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your c***s inside her, softly moaning
24320	25880	as it slides in.
26240	35880	Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm c*** wrapped around every inch of your c***.
35880	39600	Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust.
39600	44840	Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly
44840	53200	can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of your c*** into
53200	54200	her.
54200	61000	Imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking beside
61000	71080	you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way
71080	72880	possible.
72880	81760	You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in
81760	84760	your face are not the proper shape.
84760	87760	Have a nice day.
92760	96760	Hello boys, let's talk about bone structure.
103760	107360	There's something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.
107360	114040	Stalin had portmanteaus like agitprop, politburo, and kompromat, and we have webinar, podcast,
114040	116800	and incel, short for involuntary celibate.
116800	121760	The word incel was invented in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created
121760	126640	a website called Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project that was essentially a safe space
126640	129360	for people who just couldn't get it in.
129360	134120	But in our own miserable moment of internet history, the word incel refers to a more specific
134120	141240	community of mostly heterosexual men, centered around forums like incel.me and r slash braincells.
141240	145160	This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they've
145160	148840	been churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.
148840	153680	But most incels aren't violent killers, they're just men who've formed an identity around
153680	154680	not getting laid.
154680	159400	In this video I don't want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them,
159400	163160	I just want to understand who they are and why they're like this.
163200	167560	To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a person's world is to learn their language.
167560	172960	And the language of the incels, well, you'll see.
172960	175240	First base, incelese.
175240	179720	Does it ever bother you that the word women makes adult females sound just a little bit
179720	180720	too human?
180720	182520	Well incels have a solution to that.
182520	187680	They've taken to calling women feeeeeeeemoooooooines.
187680	192040	The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women, not as sisters or mothers
192040	196920	and certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object comparable
196920	201680	to a natural resource, unobtainium, to which incels believe all men are entitled and to
201680	203720	which they feel they have been unjustly denied.
203720	208920	There's a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.
208920	214480	I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.
214480	220960	We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.
220960	225240	Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, it's simply
225240	228400	that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.
228400	233200	Now femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have for women, and it's only downhill from
233200	234200	there.
234200	238720	There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores, all conveying a searing resentment
238720	244080	of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented by the bespoke incel coinage
244080	249320	roasty, which I'm sorry to inform you refers to the incel belief that the human vulva become
249320	253600	mutilated through repeated penetration by different men, though not through repeated
253600	258320	penetration by the same man interestingly, and thereby come to resemble roast beef.
258320	262800	Now by definition incels haven't actually observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy
262800	266520	is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science.
266520	271000	Though if you ask me, the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour
271000	272000	grapes.
273000	279760	Of course, not all feeeemoids are created equal, there are various subspecies.
279760	287560	The Becky or Normie femoid is to be contrasted with the Stacey, or sexually desirable femoid,
287560	295240	whose distinguishing features include makeup on point, never works a day in her life, naturally
295240	301760	curvy body gives men instant erections, big tits and ass show fertility.
301760	303600	LEAVE MY BUNS ALONE YOU SAVAGES.
303600	308640	The Stacey, naturally, has a male counterpart, whom incels call the Chad.
308640	316840	A Chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy.
316840	320040	He has never heard a song in his entire life.
320040	328080	He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow, rambow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital
328080	329080	plate.
329080	336320	It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced,
336320	343520	whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens
343520	347920	to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.
347920	350600	It's time to talk about bone structure.
350600	357120	According to a classic incel meme, the difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few
357160	359280	millimeters of bone.
359280	362320	I would like to propose a sociological theory.
362320	363920	Foppington's Law.
363920	368680	Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before
368680	373440	deep metaphysical significance is assigned to the shape of human skulls.
373440	375360	Why skulls, you ask?
375360	381640	Well, the best explanation I can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.
381640	386400	It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots
386400	388760	like to assign to certain groups of people.
388760	393360	If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,
393360	399000	you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying, well, that's
399000	403560	the reason why, it's just nature, there's nothing that can be done about it.
403560	408240	And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.
408240	412240	Mankind is divided into two groups of people, the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the
412280	416520	incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.
416520	418080	Corn dog, anyone?
418080	419080	I'm really hungry.
419080	423840	Of course it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness, they have a whole
423840	427720	dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.
427720	432200	Height cells are incel due to their inferior stature, whereas mental cells can't attract
432200	437960	women because of mental illness or autism, or they're addicts and then called drug cells.
437960	442240	Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.
442240	446120	Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.
446120	447120	Oh yeah?
447120	451680	Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?
451680	455320	Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?
455320	460600	But yeah, obviously, obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's
460600	465000	is completely irrational body dysmorphia, and the reason why no one wants to be with
465000	470840	me or even talk to me is my shitty personality, even though literal 80 IQ men who have nothing
470840	476720	to talk about except who won the game last night are still able to attract a loving partner.
476720	478560	Interesting.
478560	483120	A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed
483120	490160	to race, and they are accordingly termed Apologies in Advance, Black Cells, Rice Cells, Curry
490160	491560	Cells, and so on.
491560	494240	Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.
494240	498840	There are, of course, the occasional chads of color, with their superior skulls and towering
498840	504800	stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.
504800	505800	I'm so sorry.
505800	510600	So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race, but
510600	514880	what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.
514880	520960	Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend, that is, escape your inceldom.
520960	526000	If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement, well,
526000	531440	that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad and sorry Hope Cell.
531440	534080	Second base, the Red Pill.
534080	539040	So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview, the Stacys, the Chads, the incels,
539040	540160	and the normies.
540160	545160	From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality, which
545160	547520	they call the Red Pill.
547560	552160	Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the rest of the Manosphere, that is, pickup artists,
552160	556160	men's rights activists, and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their
556160	558840	Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW.
558840	561720	According to Red Pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.
561720	567080	Hypergamy, New Greek for marrying above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with
567080	573120	men above one's social status, and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.
573120	577480	According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the
577480	582360	sexes, so if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like
582360	587800	to do, there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women as 8 out of 10 men.
587800	592640	Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship
592640	598560	with his looks match, that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.
598560	603720	But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their
603720	607080	own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.
607240	612360	Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule, the idea that only the top 20% of men will
612360	614040	ever be desired by women.
614040	618400	Now since most heterosexual men do end up in relationships with women, you might be
618400	620200	raising your eyebrow at that idea.
620200	622440	But incels have an explanation.
622440	628560	According to the Red Pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called Alpha-Fox-Beta-Box.
628560	633820	This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping
633820	635320	with as many Chads as possible.
635560	639680	But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a Beta-Normie whom she's not really
639680	644720	attracted to, but whom she will use for financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding
644720	649360	him on the Alpha-Cock Carousel before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything
649360	653240	he's worth on a divorce settlement, and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children
653240	658200	and a new Chad boyfriend, while the Beta-Cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments,
658200	659960	solitude, and poverty.
659960	664120	So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.
664240	668280	Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,
668280	672160	or you're a Normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife
672160	676200	who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.
676200	682560	Or you could be an Alpha, an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women
682560	684840	and forms attachments to none of them.
684840	687920	In the Red Pill philosophy, there are two ways to become Alpha.
687920	690640	The first is simply to be a Chad by nature.
690640	693160	The second is to become a pickup artist.
693160	697240	Red Pill pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,
697240	702040	that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.
702040	704640	The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.
704640	708800	In fact, they try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of
708800	713920	strategies and scripts known as GAME, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the
713920	720640	Red Pill pickup artist Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from Benefit.
720640	728880	So the tube is a bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like, oh, it's so big.
728880	730640	I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.
730640	732200	I bake my own bread.
732200	739560	Yes, I am outing myself as a baker, as someone who likes to cook, I'm not a woman, I am ultra-masculine
739560	744480	as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing, and men like
744480	747920	scientific things, I used to be a scientist.
747920	752240	So Roosh, you know what, if it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new
752240	757800	life as an ultra-masculine baker, sorry, I mean bread scientist.
757800	762040	So remember, the Red Pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%
762040	766240	or less of men are really attractive to women, dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism
766240	770440	is a pretext for enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to
770440	772400	emasculation and impotence.
772400	776240	The Black Pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace
776240	780200	is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships
780200	784200	are forever out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can
784200	786720	do except lie down and rot.
786720	791760	The Black Pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.
791760	797040	It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion
797040	801960	where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks
801960	802960	and anxieties.
803120	806720	For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm going
806720	810360	to be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is going to be angry, I'm going
810360	813800	to lose my job, I'm not going to be able to get another job, I'm going to be unemployed
813800	816600	forever, my family will starve, oh god we're all going to die.
816600	821600	Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is
821600	822600	completely absurd.
822600	824800	This is exactly how the Black Pill works.
824800	827760	You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.
827760	831120	From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive
831120	834880	to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women
834880	838640	did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends
838640	842160	that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only
842160	843640	option is to lie down and rot.
843640	847400	Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.
847400	852320	On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel
852320	856040	or rope fuel, meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're
856040	860480	reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are
860480	863360	missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance.
863360	868160	Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely
868160	873160	and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's
873160	876200	just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here.
876200	880320	But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people
880320	884660	express pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness
884660	887720	is the logical conclusion of the Black Pill worldview.
887720	892000	Women's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial
892000	893000	bone structure.
893000	896720	And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.
896720	899840	Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.
899840	903920	You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are
903920	907120	millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're
907120	910440	their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some
910440	915160	friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows, maybe they'll develop a disposition
915160	917520	that women find a little more approachable.
917520	920720	Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.
920720	924520	In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,
924520	927960	Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need
927960	931920	to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.
931920	934640	But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.
934640	937360	In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.
937360	942240	You are, in effect, Chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take
942240	946800	a shower, be more confident, to people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection
946800	950240	and isolation, and who believe they've already tried everything.
950240	955120	So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility
955120	956960	and insensitivity of it.
956960	958440	Just go out to parties, bro.
958440	962800	Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident, like
962800	964560	this average looking guy.
964560	965760	Confidence is key.
965760	967840	You incels need some hobbies.
967840	969400	Try reading some books.
969400	970400	Women love intelligence.
970400	972400	It works for me, bro.
972400	974400	Aw, you just need to get out more.
974400	979840	No one knows what it's like to be hated
979840	984320	To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who
984320	986000	would try to change their minds.
986000	990000	So if you want to understand incels, and in particular if you want to understand why their
990000	994800	community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill
994800	997520	is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.
997520	1001840	It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.
1001840	1005520	So what we have in our hands here is more than a bunch of angry internet misogynists.
1005520	1011760	It's, at worst, a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.
1011760	1016120	It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since
1016120	1021040	triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?
1021040	1022400	Third base.
1022400	1023400	Tinder is garbage.
1023400	1027520	I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want
1027520	1032320	my sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil, but
1032320	1034120	on some level I can't help it.
1034120	1037800	The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the
1037800	1038800	same way.
1038800	1040360	I bet some of you have been this guy.
1040360	1042160	I have been this guy.
1042160	1045200	So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this
1045200	1051440	channel so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.
1051440	1055520	And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.
1055560	1060880	I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who
1060880	1061880	dates women.
1061880	1063720	What kind of fucked up shit is that?
1063720	1065160	Is that even allowed?
1065160	1069000	Alright, calm down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.
1069000	1070480	And those who lieth betwixt.
1070480	1071480	Cats.
1071480	1073640	The inherent eroticism of the sea.
1073640	1080280	Mmm, yeah, don't you just want to get in there?
1080280	1081280	Take me, mommy.
1081280	1083280	But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.
1083280	1084760	I gotta get my hetero on.
1084760	1089240	What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women, and as a woman
1089240	1090240	seeking men.
1090240	1093360	And I think that gives me some relevant experiences.
1093360	1097360	When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women
1097360	1103000	get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.
1103000	1109200	Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive
1109200	1110200	the inquiries.
1110200	1112400	Let's see how we're doing here.
1112400	1113800	How many men have liked me on Tinder?
1113840	1116880	I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.
1116880	1120400	I have 2,500 likes.
1120400	1123920	That's a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran.
1123920	1125440	What a divine city.
1125440	1133160	Aw, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.
1133160	1135120	Let's see what kind of messages I got.
1135120	1136480	DICK OR NO DICK?
1136480	1138280	PRE-OP OR POST-OP?
1138280	1139680	DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?
1139680	1141240	Oh my god.
1141240	1143840	I'm gonna cut it off, okay, Jesus.
1143840	1149320	I will let you smash my pussies, so, so hard, if you just be patient.
1149320	1150320	It's a whole process.
1150320	1151320	That's not a pussy.
1151320	1152320	That's a fuckhole.
1152320	1157320	You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.
1157320	1159040	Well, that's true.
1159040	1163880	I am not going to be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong,
1163880	1167800	and I assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will
1167800	1168800	be sacred.
1168800	1171440	So y'all, leave my fuckhole out of this.
1171440	1175680	When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.
1175680	1179560	He was going to take me to a concert, I was like, seems like a lot for a first date, but
1179560	1180560	we'll try it.
1180560	1184680	15 minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.
1184680	1187540	What color panties are you wearing?
1187540	1193080	I would love to smell them.
1193080	1194240	Can we get coffee first?
1194240	1198600	The hell of it is, I probably would have let him smell my panties, but this is a thing
1198600	1201880	you bring up on the third fuck, you don't open with panty sniffing.
1201880	1205160	Like the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're going to murder
1205160	1207160	me, and you're already fucking it up.
1207160	1209000	So this is the experience of women on Tinder.
1209000	1212000	We're drowning in dick, and most of it is terrible.
1212000	1215960	Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and I haven't been using the app in a couple
1215960	1220360	months so if I didn't respond to you or if we didn't match, it's not because I rejected
1220360	1223840	you, it's because I don't like the app.
1223840	1227680	People screenshot my profile and they post it online, and they call me ContraPoints
1227680	1231000	and I, like, I'm just too famous for this shit.
1231000	1232000	My life is hard.
1232000	1237560	So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that's constantly
1237560	1242000	pointed at us in dating apps, but how would you feel if instead of that, you were just
1242000	1245000	getting radio silence like the incels get?
1245000	1251000	I can't speak for other women, but personally, I prefer the firing squad of dicks, you know?
1251000	1255800	At least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick.
1255800	1257880	I feel sorry for men on dating apps, I really do.
1257880	1261200	You have to deal with a lot of rejection, and that must be difficult.
1261200	1264000	These apps are especially brutal to people who aren't photogenic.
1264000	1267520	If you're meeting people at a bar or a party, you might strike up a conversation with someone
1267520	1271800	who you're not initially physically attracted to, but then maybe they're super funny or
1271800	1275680	charming or maybe they're attracted to me, and that's an attractive quality in another
1275680	1279160	person, that they appreciate how beautiful I am.
1279320	1284400	But on Tinder, you're just browsing a catalog of faces, and gatekeeping who even gets to
1284400	1286200	talk to you in the first place.
1286200	1290960	Red Pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value,
1290960	1295680	but like, dating kind of is a marketplace, or at least you can analyze it like one.
1295680	1301240	And our culture is so visual, and these apps are so picture-centered, that bone structure,
1301240	1304280	like it's not the only thing that matters, but it matters a great deal.
1304280	1307480	And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels.
1307480	1311760	Because as a trans woman, I know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone.
1311760	1316280	I actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization
1316280	1320760	surgery, so I can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone
1320760	1326360	here and there, because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth a
1326360	1328080	brow ridge less pronounced.
1328080	1332680	I mean, I'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn incels, because I think certain
1332680	1336600	parts of my face make me look like a man, and I worry about it every day.
1336680	1338760	We're all obsessed with the bones, honey.
1338760	1341560	We all have bones inside us, we all love touching bones.
1341560	1348600	You wanna take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture, and multiply
1348600	1355880	that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad Circumference.
1355880	1358280	Why is no one talking about the Chad Circumference?
1358280	1360760	Fourth base, just the tip.
1360760	1365720	There's another way I think my experience, as a trans woman, is relevant to the incel
1365720	1370120	discussion, and that's that I recognize delusional self-loathing when I see it.
1370120	1374840	I'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer Elliot
1374840	1380360	Roger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink.
1380360	1384440	Now I'm not going to show you pictures of incels, but on their forums they do sometimes
1384440	1385880	post selfie threads.
1385880	1391880	And you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them, but in confidence, from one
1391880	1397480	pretend clinician to another, let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost
1397480	1400200	all of them are completely normal looking guys.
1400200	1403480	But of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels.
1403480	1406920	The feedback they get is that their chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is
1406920	1410920	garbage, and there's no hope whatsoever, no woman will ever love them, and they are true
1410920	1413080	cells with no option but to lie down and rot.
1413080	1418440	And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that's the
1418440	1420200	kind of feedback they're gonna get.
1420200	1421480	So why?
1421480	1422760	Why do they do it?
1422760	1424760	Well, I'll tell you a little story.
1424760	1430440	There is a website on the internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT.
1430440	1435720	A few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos,
1435720	1443240	but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining the notion of becoming women,
1443240	1448600	and by early transition trans women, so the board is jokingly called TTTT.
1448600	1453400	I've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition, but the memory is still
1453400	1458920	fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful, awkward, humiliating stage of life.
1458920	1462280	So the trans women of TTTT are tragic.
1462280	1465560	They're basically still in man mode, which is why they're using 4chan.
1465560	1469800	And I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels.
1469800	1473240	For incels, the core frustration is that they can't get laid.
1473240	1477000	For TTTT, it's that they can't pass as female.
1477000	1481080	Both groups post selfies knowing they're gonna get brutal, unconstructive feedback,
1481080	1484840	and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties.
1484840	1489400	For instance, on TTTT, a major piece of jargon is hun,
1489400	1493080	a slur used by trans women for other trans women,
1493080	1496040	which basically means that you look like a man in a dress,
1496040	1498120	which is what every trans woman is afraid of.
1498120	1502600	And there's another commonality with incels too, with all bigots and self-loathers,
1502600	1506120	which, if you've been paying attention, you've already guessed.
1507000	1509960	You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size.
1509960	1511800	Have all the surgeries in the world.
1511800	1514520	Your massive man noggin will stay the same.
1514520	1518040	Lel, this freak thinks he has very soft facial features.
1518040	1520920	His head is fucking huge, Lel.
1520920	1525160	And the huns on Reddit are hugboxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads.
1525720	1527240	Uh, no there aren't.
1527240	1529160	There aren't fucking women with heads the size of that.
1529160	1530760	And FFS won't change shit.
1530760	1532040	You might as well repress.
1532040	1533480	You transition with a man's head.
1533480	1534200	You will be clocked.
1534200	1535800	You will be looked at as a freak.
1535800	1538360	You will never be seen as a legit woman, 100%.
1539160	1541240	This is why I'm not transitioning.
1542040	1545320	Thank you, skull people, for showing me the way,
1545320	1552200	and that no matter what I do I will always be a manly man skull-wise.
1552200	1556360	You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.
1556360	1562600	"'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous,
1562600	1565000	and the facial plane wider.
1565000	1568200	It always comes back to the skulls, every time."
1568200	1573080	The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.
1573080	1577480	For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.
1578120	1578840	Yikes.
1578840	1581240	Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.
1581240	1585400	If I'm not looked at as a big-skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,
1586680	1591000	that means that some of their transitions might go well too.
1591000	1596600	And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.
1596600	1600200	So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,
1600200	1603240	why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me
1603240	1604840	shouldn't even fucking think about it.
1604840	1606280	They shouldn't transition at all.
1606280	1607560	They should just repress.
1607560	1609160	They should lie down and rot.
1609160	1610760	And I used to read this stuff all the time.
1610760	1613480	Like I would specifically seek out threads about me.
1614040	1618520	Which might seem strange considering I had hundreds of fans
1618520	1620520	telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day.
1620520	1622600	So why did I turn away from that?
1622600	1626360	To intentionally seek out this dismal den of huns talking about
1626360	1629720	how my giant hun skull is clockable at a thousand paces
1629720	1635320	and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh?
1635320	1639560	Well basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it
1639560	1641480	when people told me I was gorgeous.
1641480	1644040	And for semi-plausible reasons.
1644040	1647720	A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous
1647720	1649160	no matter what they look like.
1649160	1651480	That's where the word hun comes from.
1651480	1652440	You look great hun.
1654200	1658840	So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.
1658840	1664760	There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.
1664760	1668280	So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful,
1668280	1669960	politically correct cuckoldry.
1669960	1673240	And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT
1673240	1677480	and reading other people's saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.
1677480	1679400	And that was always painful.
1679400	1681480	But there was a kind of pleasure too.
1681480	1682680	There was a rush.
1682680	1685400	It's exciting to burst out of the politically correct bubble
1685400	1686840	and say what you're really thinking.
1686840	1690360	That personality doesn't matter because big-skulled chads get all the girls.
1690360	1694200	That ContraPoints is a big-skulled hun with a voice like nails on a chalkboard.
1694200	1698520	And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.
1698520	1700680	I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.
1700680	1702520	It's simply my job.
1702520	1704840	But soon I realized it wasn't just research.
1704840	1706920	And it was infecting me away from the computer.
1706920	1708920	This ridiculous vocabulary.
1708920	1710840	Huns. AGP.
1710840	1713480	Was popping up in my head at unexpected times.
1713480	1715880	It was starting to color how I thought about myself.
1715880	1720040	And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.
1720040	1723320	And that's the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now
1723320	1725000	or I'm going to become a monster.
1725000	1727720	And once that happens it's going to be very difficult to fix.
1727720	1730120	This is exactly how the incel black pill works.
1730120	1732520	There's something infectious about these vocabularies.
1732520	1734840	Like on days I've been working on this video,
1734840	1739400	I'll go out at night and these words just involuntarily show up in my thoughts.
1739400	1741240	That bartender is such a chad.
1741240	1743320	He's totally height mocking that tiny cock.
1743320	1747240	And the tragic thing is some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds
1747240	1748440	until it's too late.
1748440	1749320	Let's face it.
1749320	1752200	Black pills are suey fuel.
1752200	1754520	And a lot of us can't handle them.
1754520	1757720	I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it
1757720	1761880	since I loved uncovering secrets that society had been hiding from me.
1761880	1767880	But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.
1767880	1771080	I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago
1771080	1774040	and I've never needed to do that before.
1774040	1776360	I could always talk myself out of it through logic,
1776360	1779880	but my mind is ruined now.
1780600	1784440	This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,
1784440	1788680	prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.
1788680	1792760	But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out
1792760	1796280	abusive and disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.
1796280	1798360	I have a long history of doing this,
1798360	1800440	intentionally looking for abusive comments,
1800440	1804840	especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.
1804840	1805640	Why?
1805640	1806200	I don't know.
1806920	1808680	Why do people cut themselves?
1808680	1812440	Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.
1812440	1814280	Whatever hurts is true.
1814280	1816360	I've recently gotten much better about this.
1816440	1819240	I haven't been to any of the worst places in a couple months.
1819240	1822280	And my mental health has much improved.
1822280	1826440	So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position
1826440	1827800	worthy of rational debate.
1827800	1832280	Because these ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments.
1832280	1834840	You're using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves.
1834840	1837240	And I know, because I've done the exact same thing.
1837240	1839640	The incel worldview is catastrophizing.
1839640	1841160	It's an anxious death spiral.
1841160	1844600	And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical.
1844600	1845880	A lot of you are lonely.
1845880	1847560	You've been bullied and neglected.
1847560	1849480	You feel left behind by society.
1849480	1853400	But what you're doing when you're reading incel forums is you're slowly internalizing
1853400	1858280	a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves, and at other people in your situation, and
1858280	1858920	at women.
1858920	1862040	And you're forming mental habits that are going to make it very difficult for you to
1862040	1863160	live a happy life.
1863160	1866520	So what you have to do is get off those forums as fast as possible.
1867080	1871560	I'm going to post a link in the description of this video to instructions on how to block
1871560	1875880	certain websites from your computer, because for me, that's what it took.
1877320	1878120	Fifth base.
1880360	1881080	Anal.
1881080	1884760	So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit.
1884760	1890440	And that limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred
1890440	1893400	is not directed at themselves, but at women.
1893400	1895800	And they really hate women.
1895800	1899400	Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry scholar at this point.
1899400	1901240	I look at this kind of stuff all the time.
1901480	1906280	Researching this video, I was honestly kind of shocked at the intensity of misogyny on
1906280	1907240	incel forums.
1907240	1911240	I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape, saying they
1911240	1916840	deserve to be raped, calls for state-mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all
1916840	1920680	just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.
1920680	1921640	I hate women.
1922360	1923560	I really do.
1924280	1929480	Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof.
1929480	1933240	When they're gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton.
1933240	1938120	When they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time, rifling through their stupid
1938120	1938680	purse.
1938680	1941320	When they whine to me about their period.
1941320	1946760	When they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician nobody gives a flipping
1946760	1947560	fuck about.
1947560	1950680	When they cry and expect your personal sympathy.
1950680	1956200	But most of all, I hate them because they're smug, hyperactive little bitches made that
1956200	1959320	way by our shithole society.
1959560	1962920	Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done.
1962920	1964760	Hi Stacey, it's Tracey.
1964760	1968600	Well I was at the mall the other day with Amber, Heather, Jenna, and Trish and we were
1968600	1974200	talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018.
1974200	1977720	They live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking of women
1977720	1978600	as fully human.
1978600	1982760	And that's where my sympathy runs dry, because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to
1982760	1983880	turn to violence.
1983880	1987480	So incels, I know you're not going to listen to anything I say, and you're just going
1987480	1989880	to say that I'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate.
1989880	1993640	And to that I say, how dare you say things that are entirely true.
1993640	1996040	But also, vol sol if you wouldn't, bitches.
1996040	1999240	And I know you don't listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have
1999240	2003480	healthy relationships, so no one can really reach you until you get out of those forums
2003480	2005000	and allow yourselves to be reached.
2005000	2009160	But by way of a closing remark, I guess I simply invite you to consider that you don't
2009160	2012920	even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic longing.
2012920	2018120	You know, when I was your age in 1975, every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in his bedroom
2019240	2021640	that was the outlet for his sexual frustration.
2021640	2025240	What I'm suggesting is the Manosphere exists because rock and roll is dead.
2025240	2026760	But there's other options.
2027400	2029640	Think about the eroticism of a rainstorm.
2030920	2032040	The clap of thunder.
2033160	2035000	The rustle of leaves.
2036040	2039080	The steam rising off the warm pavement.
2043480	2049880	And whether you're a Chad, a Stacey, an Incel, or a Hun, you can always return to the caress
2049880	2071080	of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.
2102920	2105080	Is it just me?
