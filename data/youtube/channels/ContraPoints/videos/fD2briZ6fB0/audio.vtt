00:00.000 --> 00:07.860
Imagine how a woman feels.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.240
Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.300
Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume.

00:14.300 --> 00:18.960
Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours.

00:18.960 --> 00:24.320
Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your c***s inside her, softly moaning

00:24.320 --> 00:25.880
as it slides in.

00:26.240 --> 00:35.880
Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm c*** wrapped around every inch of your c***.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.600
Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.840
Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly

00:44.840 --> 00:53.200
can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of your c*** into

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
her.

00:54.200 --> 01:01.000
Imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking beside

01:01.000 --> 01:11.080
you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way

01:11.080 --> 01:12.880
possible.

01:12.880 --> 01:21.760
You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in

01:21.760 --> 01:24.760
your face are not the proper shape.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.760
Have a nice day.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.760
Hello boys, let's talk about bone structure.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.360
There's something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.040
Stalin had portmanteaus like agitprop, politburo, and kompromat, and we have webinar, podcast,

01:54.040 --> 01:56.800
and incel, short for involuntary celibate.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.760
The word incel was invented in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created

02:01.760 --> 02:06.640
a website called Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project that was essentially a safe space

02:06.640 --> 02:09.360
for people who just couldn't get it in.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.120
But in our own miserable moment of internet history, the word incel refers to a more specific

02:14.120 --> 02:21.240
community of mostly heterosexual men, centered around forums like incel.me and r slash braincells.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.160
This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they've

02:25.160 --> 02:28.840
been churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.680
But most incels aren't violent killers, they're just men who've formed an identity around

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
not getting laid.

02:34.680 --> 02:39.400
In this video I don't want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them,

02:39.400 --> 02:43.160
I just want to understand who they are and why they're like this.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.560
To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a person's world is to learn their language.

02:47.560 --> 02:52.960
And the language of the incels, well, you'll see.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.240
First base, incelese.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.720
Does it ever bother you that the word women makes adult females sound just a little bit

02:59.720 --> 03:00.720
too human?

03:00.720 --> 03:02.520
Well incels have a solution to that.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.680
They've taken to calling women feeeeeeeemoooooooines.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.040
The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women, not as sisters or mothers

03:12.040 --> 03:16.920
and certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object comparable

03:16.920 --> 03:21.680
to a natural resource, unobtainium, to which incels believe all men are entitled and to

03:21.680 --> 03:23.720
which they feel they have been unjustly denied.

03:23.720 --> 03:28.920
There's a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.

03:28.920 --> 03:34.480
I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.

03:34.480 --> 03:40.960
We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.240
Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, it's simply

03:45.240 --> 03:48.400
that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.

03:48.400 --> 03:53.200
Now femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have for women, and it's only downhill from

03:53.200 --> 03:54.200
there.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.720
There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores, all conveying a searing resentment

03:58.720 --> 04:04.080
of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented by the bespoke incel coinage

04:04.080 --> 04:09.320
roasty, which I'm sorry to inform you refers to the incel belief that the human vulva become

04:09.320 --> 04:13.600
mutilated through repeated penetration by different men, though not through repeated

04:13.600 --> 04:18.320
penetration by the same man interestingly, and thereby come to resemble roast beef.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.800
Now by definition incels haven't actually observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy

04:22.800 --> 04:26.520
is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science.

04:26.520 --> 04:31.000
Though if you ask me, the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
grapes.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.760
Of course, not all feeeemoids are created equal, there are various subspecies.

04:39.760 --> 04:47.560
The Becky or Normie femoid is to be contrasted with the Stacey, or sexually desirable femoid,

04:47.560 --> 04:55.240
whose distinguishing features include makeup on point, never works a day in her life, naturally

04:55.240 --> 05:01.760
curvy body gives men instant erections, big tits and ass show fertility.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.600
LEAVE MY BUNS ALONE YOU SAVAGES.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.640
The Stacey, naturally, has a male counterpart, whom incels call the Chad.

05:08.640 --> 05:16.840
A Chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.040
He has never heard a song in his entire life.

05:20.040 --> 05:28.080
He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow, rambow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital

05:28.080 --> 05:29.080
plate.

05:29.080 --> 05:36.320
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced,

05:36.320 --> 05:43.520
whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens

05:43.520 --> 05:47.920
to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.600
It's time to talk about bone structure.

05:50.600 --> 05:57.120
According to a classic incel meme, the difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few

05:57.160 --> 05:59.280
millimeters of bone.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.320
I would like to propose a sociological theory.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.920
Foppington's Law.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.680
Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before

06:08.680 --> 06:13.440
deep metaphysical significance is assigned to the shape of human skulls.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.360
Why skulls, you ask?

06:15.360 --> 06:21.640
Well, the best explanation I can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.

06:21.640 --> 06:26.400
It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots

06:26.400 --> 06:28.760
like to assign to certain groups of people.

06:28.760 --> 06:33.360
If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,

06:33.360 --> 06:39.000
you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying, well, that's

06:39.000 --> 06:43.560
the reason why, it's just nature, there's nothing that can be done about it.

06:43.560 --> 06:48.240
And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.240
Mankind is divided into two groups of people, the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the

06:52.280 --> 06:56.520
incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.080
Corn dog, anyone?

06:58.080 --> 06:59.080
I'm really hungry.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.840
Of course it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness, they have a whole

07:03.840 --> 07:07.720
dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.200
Height cells are incel due to their inferior stature, whereas mental cells can't attract

07:12.200 --> 07:17.960
women because of mental illness or autism, or they're addicts and then called drug cells.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.240
Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.120
Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
Oh yeah?

07:27.120 --> 07:31.680
Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?

07:31.680 --> 07:35.320
Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?

07:35.320 --> 07:40.600
But yeah, obviously, obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's

07:40.600 --> 07:45.000
is completely irrational body dysmorphia, and the reason why no one wants to be with

07:45.000 --> 07:50.840
me or even talk to me is my shitty personality, even though literal 80 IQ men who have nothing

07:50.840 --> 07:56.720
to talk about except who won the game last night are still able to attract a loving partner.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.560
Interesting.

07:58.560 --> 08:03.120
A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed

08:03.120 --> 08:10.160
to race, and they are accordingly termed Apologies in Advance, Black Cells, Rice Cells, Curry

08:10.160 --> 08:11.560
Cells, and so on.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.240
Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.840
There are, of course, the occasional chads of color, with their superior skulls and towering

08:18.840 --> 08:24.800
stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.800
I'm so sorry.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.600
So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race, but

08:30.600 --> 08:34.880
what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.

08:34.880 --> 08:40.960
Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend, that is, escape your inceldom.

08:40.960 --> 08:46.000
If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement, well,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.440
that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad and sorry Hope Cell.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.080
Second base, the Red Pill.

08:54.080 --> 08:59.040
So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview, the Stacys, the Chads, the incels,

08:59.040 --> 09:00.160
and the normies.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.160
From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality, which

09:05.160 --> 09:07.520
they call the Red Pill.

09:07.560 --> 09:12.160
Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the rest of the Manosphere, that is, pickup artists,

09:12.160 --> 09:16.160
men's rights activists, and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their

09:16.160 --> 09:18.840
Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.720
According to Red Pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.

09:21.720 --> 09:27.080
Hypergamy, New Greek for marrying above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with

09:27.080 --> 09:33.120
men above one's social status, and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.480
According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the

09:37.480 --> 09:42.360
sexes, so if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like

09:42.360 --> 09:47.800
to do, there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women as 8 out of 10 men.

09:47.800 --> 09:52.640
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship

09:52.640 --> 09:58.560
with his looks match, that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.

09:58.560 --> 10:03.720
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their

10:03.720 --> 10:07.080
own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.

10:07.240 --> 10:12.360
Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule, the idea that only the top 20% of men will

10:12.360 --> 10:14.040
ever be desired by women.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.400
Now since most heterosexual men do end up in relationships with women, you might be

10:18.400 --> 10:20.200
raising your eyebrow at that idea.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.440
But incels have an explanation.

10:22.440 --> 10:28.560
According to the Red Pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called Alpha-Fox-Beta-Box.

10:28.560 --> 10:33.820
This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping

10:33.820 --> 10:35.320
with as many Chads as possible.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.680
But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a Beta-Normie whom she's not really

10:39.680 --> 10:44.720
attracted to, but whom she will use for financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding

10:44.720 --> 10:49.360
him on the Alpha-Cock Carousel before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything

10:49.360 --> 10:53.240
he's worth on a divorce settlement, and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children

10:53.240 --> 10:58.200
and a new Chad boyfriend, while the Beta-Cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments,

10:58.200 --> 10:59.960
solitude, and poverty.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.120
So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.280
Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,

11:08.280 --> 11:12.160
or you're a Normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife

11:12.160 --> 11:16.200
who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.

11:16.200 --> 11:22.560
Or you could be an Alpha, an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women

11:22.560 --> 11:24.840
and forms attachments to none of them.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.920
In the Red Pill philosophy, there are two ways to become Alpha.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.640
The first is simply to be a Chad by nature.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.160
The second is to become a pickup artist.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.240
Red Pill pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,

11:37.240 --> 11:42.040
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.640
The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.800
In fact, they try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of

11:48.800 --> 11:53.920
strategies and scripts known as GAME, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the

11:53.920 --> 12:00.640
Red Pill pickup artist Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from Benefit.

12:00.640 --> 12:08.880
So the tube is a bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like, oh, it's so big.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.640
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.200
I bake my own bread.

12:12.200 --> 12:19.560
Yes, I am outing myself as a baker, as someone who likes to cook, I'm not a woman, I am ultra-masculine

12:19.560 --> 12:24.480
as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing, and men like

12:24.480 --> 12:27.920
scientific things, I used to be a scientist.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.240
So Roosh, you know what, if it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new

12:32.240 --> 12:37.800
life as an ultra-masculine baker, sorry, I mean bread scientist.

12:37.800 --> 12:42.040
So remember, the Red Pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%

12:42.040 --> 12:46.240
or less of men are really attractive to women, dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism

12:46.240 --> 12:50.440
is a pretext for enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to

12:50.440 --> 12:52.400
emasculation and impotence.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.240
The Black Pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace

12:56.240 --> 13:00.200
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships

13:00.200 --> 13:04.200
are forever out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can

13:04.200 --> 13:06.720
do except lie down and rot.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.760
The Black Pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.

13:11.760 --> 13:17.040
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion

13:17.040 --> 13:21.960
where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
and anxieties.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.720
For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm going

13:26.720 --> 13:30.360
to be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is going to be angry, I'm going

13:30.360 --> 13:33.800
to lose my job, I'm not going to be able to get another job, I'm going to be unemployed

13:33.800 --> 13:36.600
forever, my family will starve, oh god we're all going to die.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.600
Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
completely absurd.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.800
This is exactly how the Black Pill works.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.760
You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.120
From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive

13:51.120 --> 13:54.880
to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women

13:54.880 --> 13:58.640
did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends

13:58.640 --> 14:02.160
that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only

14:02.160 --> 14:03.640
option is to lie down and rot.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.400
Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.320
On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel

14:12.320 --> 14:16.040
or rope fuel, meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're

14:16.040 --> 14:20.480
reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are

14:20.480 --> 14:23.360
missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance.

14:23.360 --> 14:28.160
Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely

14:28.160 --> 14:33.160
and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's

14:33.160 --> 14:36.200
just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.320
But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people

14:40.320 --> 14:44.660
express pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness

14:44.660 --> 14:47.720
is the logical conclusion of the Black Pill worldview.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.000
Women's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
bone structure.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.720
And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.840
Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.920
You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are

15:03.920 --> 15:07.120
millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're

15:07.120 --> 15:10.440
their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some

15:10.440 --> 15:15.160
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows, maybe they'll develop a disposition

15:15.160 --> 15:17.520
that women find a little more approachable.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.720
Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.520
In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,

15:24.520 --> 15:27.960
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need

15:27.960 --> 15:31.920
to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.640
But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.360
In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.

15:37.360 --> 15:42.240
You are, in effect, Chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take

15:42.240 --> 15:46.800
a shower, be more confident, to people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection

15:46.800 --> 15:50.240
and isolation, and who believe they've already tried everything.

15:50.240 --> 15:55.120
So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility

15:55.120 --> 15:56.960
and insensitivity of it.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.440
Just go out to parties, bro.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.800
Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident, like

16:02.800 --> 16:04.560
this average looking guy.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.760
Confidence is key.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.840
You incels need some hobbies.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.400
Try reading some books.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
Women love intelligence.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
It works for me, bro.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
Aw, you just need to get out more.

16:14.400 --> 16:19.840
No one knows what it's like to be hated

16:19.840 --> 16:24.320
To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who

16:24.320 --> 16:26.000
would try to change their minds.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
So if you want to understand incels, and in particular if you want to understand why their

16:30.000 --> 16:34.800
community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill

16:34.800 --> 16:37.520
is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.840
It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.520
So what we have in our hands here is more than a bunch of angry internet misogynists.

16:45.520 --> 16:51.760
It's, at worst, a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.

16:51.760 --> 16:56.120
It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since

16:56.120 --> 17:01.040
triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.400
Third base.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.400
Tinder is garbage.

17:03.400 --> 17:07.520
I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want

17:07.520 --> 17:12.320
my sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil, but

17:12.320 --> 17:14.120
on some level I can't help it.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.800
The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
same way.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.360
I bet some of you have been this guy.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.160
I have been this guy.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.200
So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this

17:25.200 --> 17:31.440
channel so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.520
And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.

17:35.560 --> 17:40.880
I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
dates women.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.720
What kind of fucked up shit is that?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.160
Is that even allowed?

17:45.160 --> 17:49.000
Alright, calm down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.480
And those who lieth betwixt.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.480
Cats.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.640
The inherent eroticism of the sea.

17:53.640 --> 18:00.280
Mmm, yeah, don't you just want to get in there?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.280
Take me, mommy.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.280
But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.760
I gotta get my hetero on.

18:04.760 --> 18:09.240
What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women, and as a woman

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
seeking men.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.360
And I think that gives me some relevant experiences.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.360
When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women

18:17.360 --> 18:23.000
get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.200
Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
the inquiries.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.400
Let's see how we're doing here.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.800
How many men have liked me on Tinder?

18:33.840 --> 18:36.880
I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.400
I have 2,500 likes.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.920
That's a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.440
What a divine city.

18:45.440 --> 18:53.160
Aw, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.120
Let's see what kind of messages I got.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.480
DICK OR NO DICK?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.280
PRE-OP OR POST-OP?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.680
DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.240
Oh my god.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.840
I'm gonna cut it off, okay, Jesus.

19:03.840 --> 19:09.320
I will let you smash my pussies, so, so hard, if you just be patient.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.320
It's a whole process.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.320
That's not a pussy.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.320
That's a fuckhole.

19:12.320 --> 19:17.320
You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.040
Well, that's true.

19:19.040 --> 19:23.880
I am not going to be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong,

19:23.880 --> 19:27.800
and I assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
be sacred.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.440
So y'all, leave my fuckhole out of this.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.680
When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.560
He was going to take me to a concert, I was like, seems like a lot for a first date, but

19:39.560 --> 19:40.560
we'll try it.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.680
15 minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.540
What color panties are you wearing?

19:47.540 --> 19:53.080
I would love to smell them.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.240
Can we get coffee first?

19:54.240 --> 19:58.600
The hell of it is, I probably would have let him smell my panties, but this is a thing

19:58.600 --> 20:01.880
you bring up on the third fuck, you don't open with panty sniffing.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.160
Like the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're going to murder

20:05.160 --> 20:07.160
me, and you're already fucking it up.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.000
So this is the experience of women on Tinder.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
We're drowning in dick, and most of it is terrible.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.960
Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and I haven't been using the app in a couple

20:15.960 --> 20:20.360
months so if I didn't respond to you or if we didn't match, it's not because I rejected

20:20.360 --> 20:23.840
you, it's because I don't like the app.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.680
People screenshot my profile and they post it online, and they call me ContraPoints

20:27.680 --> 20:31.000
and I, like, I'm just too famous for this shit.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
My life is hard.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.560
So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that's constantly

20:37.560 --> 20:42.000
pointed at us in dating apps, but how would you feel if instead of that, you were just

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
getting radio silence like the incels get?

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
I can't speak for other women, but personally, I prefer the firing squad of dicks, you know?

20:51.000 --> 20:55.800
At least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.880
I feel sorry for men on dating apps, I really do.

20:57.880 --> 21:01.200
You have to deal with a lot of rejection, and that must be difficult.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.000
These apps are especially brutal to people who aren't photogenic.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.520
If you're meeting people at a bar or a party, you might strike up a conversation with someone

21:07.520 --> 21:11.800
who you're not initially physically attracted to, but then maybe they're super funny or

21:11.800 --> 21:15.680
charming or maybe they're attracted to me, and that's an attractive quality in another

21:15.680 --> 21:19.160
person, that they appreciate how beautiful I am.

21:19.320 --> 21:24.400
But on Tinder, you're just browsing a catalog of faces, and gatekeeping who even gets to

21:24.400 --> 21:26.200
talk to you in the first place.

21:26.200 --> 21:30.960
Red Pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value,

21:30.960 --> 21:35.680
but like, dating kind of is a marketplace, or at least you can analyze it like one.

21:35.680 --> 21:41.240
And our culture is so visual, and these apps are so picture-centered, that bone structure,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.280
like it's not the only thing that matters, but it matters a great deal.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.480
And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.760
Because as a trans woman, I know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone.

21:51.760 --> 21:56.280
I actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization

21:56.280 --> 22:00.760
surgery, so I can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone

22:00.760 --> 22:06.360
here and there, because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth a

22:06.360 --> 22:08.080
brow ridge less pronounced.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.680
I mean, I'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn incels, because I think certain

22:12.680 --> 22:16.600
parts of my face make me look like a man, and I worry about it every day.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.760
We're all obsessed with the bones, honey.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.560
We all have bones inside us, we all love touching bones.

22:21.560 --> 22:28.600
You wanna take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture, and multiply

22:28.600 --> 22:35.880
that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad Circumference.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.280
Why is no one talking about the Chad Circumference?

22:38.280 --> 22:40.760
Fourth base, just the tip.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.720
There's another way I think my experience, as a trans woman, is relevant to the incel

22:45.720 --> 22:50.120
discussion, and that's that I recognize delusional self-loathing when I see it.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.840
I'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer Elliot

22:54.840 --> 23:00.360
Roger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.440
Now I'm not going to show you pictures of incels, but on their forums they do sometimes

23:04.440 --> 23:05.880
post selfie threads.

23:05.880 --> 23:11.880
And you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them, but in confidence, from one

23:11.880 --> 23:17.480
pretend clinician to another, let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost

23:17.480 --> 23:20.200
all of them are completely normal looking guys.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.480
But of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.920
The feedback they get is that their chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is

23:26.920 --> 23:30.920
garbage, and there's no hope whatsoever, no woman will ever love them, and they are true

23:30.920 --> 23:33.080
cells with no option but to lie down and rot.

23:33.080 --> 23:38.440
And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that's the

23:38.440 --> 23:40.200
kind of feedback they're gonna get.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.480
So why?

23:41.480 --> 23:42.760
Why do they do it?

23:42.760 --> 23:44.760
Well, I'll tell you a little story.

23:44.760 --> 23:50.440
There is a website on the internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT.

23:50.440 --> 23:55.720
A few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos,

23:55.720 --> 24:03.240
but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining the notion of becoming women,

24:03.240 --> 24:08.600
and by early transition trans women, so the board is jokingly called TTTT.

24:08.600 --> 24:13.400
I've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition, but the memory is still

24:13.400 --> 24:18.920
fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful, awkward, humiliating stage of life.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.280
So the trans women of TTTT are tragic.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.560
They're basically still in man mode, which is why they're using 4chan.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.800
And I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.240
For incels, the core frustration is that they can't get laid.

24:33.240 --> 24:37.000
For TTTT, it's that they can't pass as female.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.080
Both groups post selfies knowing they're gonna get brutal, unconstructive feedback,

24:41.080 --> 24:44.840
and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties.

24:44.840 --> 24:49.400
For instance, on TTTT, a major piece of jargon is hun,

24:49.400 --> 24:53.080
a slur used by trans women for other trans women,

24:53.080 --> 24:56.040
which basically means that you look like a man in a dress,

24:56.040 --> 24:58.120
which is what every trans woman is afraid of.

24:58.120 --> 25:02.600
And there's another commonality with incels too, with all bigots and self-loathers,

25:02.600 --> 25:06.120
which, if you've been paying attention, you've already guessed.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.960
You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.800
Have all the surgeries in the world.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.520
Your massive man noggin will stay the same.

25:14.520 --> 25:18.040
Lel, this freak thinks he has very soft facial features.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.920
His head is fucking huge, Lel.

25:20.920 --> 25:25.160
And the huns on Reddit are hugboxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.240
Uh, no there aren't.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.160
There aren't fucking women with heads the size of that.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.760
And FFS won't change shit.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.040
You might as well repress.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.480
You transition with a man's head.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.200
You will be clocked.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.800
You will be looked at as a freak.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.360
You will never be seen as a legit woman, 100%.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.240
This is why I'm not transitioning.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.320
Thank you, skull people, for showing me the way,

25:45.320 --> 25:52.200
and that no matter what I do I will always be a manly man skull-wise.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.360
You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.

25:56.360 --> 26:02.600
"'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous,

26:02.600 --> 26:05.000
and the facial plane wider.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.200
It always comes back to the skulls, every time."

26:08.200 --> 26:13.080
The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.

26:13.080 --> 26:17.480
For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.

26:18.120 --> 26:18.840
Yikes.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.240
Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.

26:21.240 --> 26:25.400
If I'm not looked at as a big-skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,

26:26.680 --> 26:31.000
that means that some of their transitions might go well too.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.600
And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.200
So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,

26:40.200 --> 26:43.240
why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me

26:43.240 --> 26:44.840
shouldn't even fucking think about it.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.280
They shouldn't transition at all.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.560
They should just repress.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.160
They should lie down and rot.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.760
And I used to read this stuff all the time.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.480
Like I would specifically seek out threads about me.

26:54.040 --> 26:58.520
Which might seem strange considering I had hundreds of fans

26:58.520 --> 27:00.520
telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.600
So why did I turn away from that?

27:02.600 --> 27:06.360
To intentionally seek out this dismal den of huns talking about

27:06.360 --> 27:09.720
how my giant hun skull is clockable at a thousand paces

27:09.720 --> 27:15.320
and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh?

27:15.320 --> 27:19.560
Well basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it

27:19.560 --> 27:21.480
when people told me I was gorgeous.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.040
And for semi-plausible reasons.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.720
A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous

27:27.720 --> 27:29.160
no matter what they look like.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.480
That's where the word hun comes from.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.440
You look great hun.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.840
So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.

27:38.840 --> 27:44.760
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.

27:44.760 --> 27:48.280
So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful,

27:48.280 --> 27:49.960
politically correct cuckoldry.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.240
And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT

27:53.240 --> 27:57.480
and reading other people's saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.400
And that was always painful.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.480
But there was a kind of pleasure too.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.680
There was a rush.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.400
It's exciting to burst out of the politically correct bubble

28:05.400 --> 28:06.840
and say what you're really thinking.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.360
That personality doesn't matter because big-skulled chads get all the girls.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.200
That ContraPoints is a big-skulled hun with a voice like nails on a chalkboard.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.520
And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.680
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.520
It's simply my job.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.840
But soon I realized it wasn't just research.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.920
And it was infecting me away from the computer.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.920
This ridiculous vocabulary.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.840
Huns. AGP.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.480
Was popping up in my head at unexpected times.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.880
It was starting to color how I thought about myself.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.040
And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.320
And that's the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now

28:43.320 --> 28:45.000
or I'm going to become a monster.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.720
And once that happens it's going to be very difficult to fix.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.120
This is exactly how the incel black pill works.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.520
There's something infectious about these vocabularies.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.840
Like on days I've been working on this video,

28:54.840 --> 28:59.400
I'll go out at night and these words just involuntarily show up in my thoughts.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.240
That bartender is such a chad.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.320
He's totally height mocking that tiny cock.

29:03.320 --> 29:07.240
And the tragic thing is some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds

29:07.240 --> 29:08.440
until it's too late.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.320
Let's face it.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.200
Black pills are suey fuel.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.520
And a lot of us can't handle them.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.720
I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it

29:17.720 --> 29:21.880
since I loved uncovering secrets that society had been hiding from me.

29:21.880 --> 29:27.880
But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.080
I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago

29:31.080 --> 29:34.040
and I've never needed to do that before.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.360
I could always talk myself out of it through logic,

29:36.360 --> 29:39.880
but my mind is ruined now.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.440
This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,

29:44.440 --> 29:48.680
prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.760
But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out

29:52.760 --> 29:56.280
abusive and disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.360
I have a long history of doing this,

29:58.360 --> 30:00.440
intentionally looking for abusive comments,

30:00.440 --> 30:04.840
especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.

30:04.840 --> 30:05.640
Why?

30:05.640 --> 30:06.200
I don't know.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.680
Why do people cut themselves?

30:08.680 --> 30:12.440
Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.280
Whatever hurts is true.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.360
I've recently gotten much better about this.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.240
I haven't been to any of the worst places in a couple months.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.280
And my mental health has much improved.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.440
So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position

30:26.440 --> 30:27.800
worthy of rational debate.

30:27.800 --> 30:32.280
Because these ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.840
You're using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.240
And I know, because I've done the exact same thing.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.640
The incel worldview is catastrophizing.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.160
It's an anxious death spiral.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.600
And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.880
A lot of you are lonely.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.560
You've been bullied and neglected.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.480
You feel left behind by society.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.400
But what you're doing when you're reading incel forums is you're slowly internalizing

30:53.400 --> 30:58.280
a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves, and at other people in your situation, and

30:58.280 --> 30:58.920
at women.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.040
And you're forming mental habits that are going to make it very difficult for you to

31:02.040 --> 31:03.160
live a happy life.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.520
So what you have to do is get off those forums as fast as possible.

31:07.080 --> 31:11.560
I'm going to post a link in the description of this video to instructions on how to block

31:11.560 --> 31:15.880
certain websites from your computer, because for me, that's what it took.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.120
Fifth base.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.080
Anal.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.760
So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit.

31:24.760 --> 31:30.440
And that limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred

31:30.440 --> 31:33.400
is not directed at themselves, but at women.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.800
And they really hate women.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.400
Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry scholar at this point.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.240
I look at this kind of stuff all the time.

31:41.480 --> 31:46.280
Researching this video, I was honestly kind of shocked at the intensity of misogyny on

31:46.280 --> 31:47.240
incel forums.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.240
I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape, saying they

31:51.240 --> 31:56.840
deserve to be raped, calls for state-mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all

31:56.840 --> 32:00.680
just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.640
I hate women.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.560
I really do.

32:04.280 --> 32:09.480
Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.240
When they're gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton.

32:13.240 --> 32:18.120
When they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time, rifling through their stupid

32:18.120 --> 32:18.680
purse.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.320
When they whine to me about their period.

32:21.320 --> 32:26.760
When they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician nobody gives a flipping

32:26.760 --> 32:27.560
fuck about.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.680
When they cry and expect your personal sympathy.

32:30.680 --> 32:36.200
But most of all, I hate them because they're smug, hyperactive little bitches made that

32:36.200 --> 32:39.320
way by our shithole society.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.920
Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.760
Hi Stacey, it's Tracey.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.600
Well I was at the mall the other day with Amber, Heather, Jenna, and Trish and we were

32:48.600 --> 32:54.200
talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.720
They live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking of women

32:57.720 --> 32:58.600
as fully human.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.760
And that's where my sympathy runs dry, because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to

33:02.760 --> 33:03.880
turn to violence.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.480
So incels, I know you're not going to listen to anything I say, and you're just going

33:07.480 --> 33:09.880
to say that I'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.640
And to that I say, how dare you say things that are entirely true.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.040
But also, vol sol if you wouldn't, bitches.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.240
And I know you don't listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have

33:19.240 --> 33:23.480
healthy relationships, so no one can really reach you until you get out of those forums

33:23.480 --> 33:25.000
and allow yourselves to be reached.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.160
But by way of a closing remark, I guess I simply invite you to consider that you don't

33:29.160 --> 33:32.920
even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic longing.

33:32.920 --> 33:38.120
You know, when I was your age in 1975, every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in his bedroom

33:39.240 --> 33:41.640
that was the outlet for his sexual frustration.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.240
What I'm suggesting is the Manosphere exists because rock and roll is dead.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.760
But there's other options.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.640
Think about the eroticism of a rainstorm.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.040
The clap of thunder.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.000
The rustle of leaves.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.080
The steam rising off the warm pavement.

34:03.480 --> 34:09.880
And whether you're a Chad, a Stacey, an Incel, or a Hun, you can always return to the caress

34:09.880 --> 34:31.080
of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.080
Is it just me?
