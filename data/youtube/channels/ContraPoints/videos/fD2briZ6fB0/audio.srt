1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
Imagine how a woman feels.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,240
Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,300
Imagine the sweet smell of her perfume.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,960
Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against yours.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your c***s inside her, softly moaning

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,880
as it slides in.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:35,880
Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm c*** wrapped around every inch of your c***.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,600
Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every thrust.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,840
Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as she possibly

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:53,200
can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of your c*** into

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
her.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking beside

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,080
you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
possible.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,760
You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
your face are not the proper shape.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Have a nice day.

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Hello boys, let's talk about bone structure.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,360
There's something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Stalin had portmanteaus like agitprop, politburo, and kompromat, and we have webinar, podcast,

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,800
and incel, short for involuntary celibate.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,760
The word incel was invented in the late 90s by a lonely bisexual called Alana, who created

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,640
a website called Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project that was essentially a safe space

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
for people who just couldn't get it in.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,120
But in our own miserable moment of internet history, the word incel refers to a more specific

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,240
community of mostly heterosexual men, centered around forums like incel.me and r slash braincells.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,160
This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press because for the last few years they've

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,840
been churning out mass murderers faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.

29
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,680
But most incels aren't violent killers, they're just men who've formed an identity around

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
not getting laid.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,400
In this video I don't want to mock incels or lecture them or even sympathize with them,

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,160
I just want to understand who they are and why they're like this.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,560
To start with, sometimes the best way to understand a person's world is to learn their language.

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,960
And the language of the incels, well, you'll see.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,240
First base, incelese.

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,720
Does it ever bother you that the word women makes adult females sound just a little bit

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
too human?

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
Well incels have a solution to that.

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,680
They've taken to calling women feeeeeeeemoooooooines.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,040
The choice of vocabulary tells us how incels think of women, not as sisters or mothers

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,920
and certainly not as autonomous people, but as a kind of foreign, inscrutable object comparable

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,680
to a natural resource, unobtainium, to which incels believe all men are entitled and to

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,720
which they feel they have been unjustly denied.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,920
There's a long tradition of nerdy men talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,960
We are reserving 110 pounds of payload for recreational equipment.

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,240
Which is not to say that alpha males are less misogynistic than nerds, it's simply

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,400
that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Now femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have for women, and it's only downhill from

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
there.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,720
There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores, all conveying a searing resentment

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,080
of female sexuality, the pinnacle of which is represented by the bespoke incel coinage

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,320
roasty, which I'm sorry to inform you refers to the incel belief that the human vulva become

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,600
mutilated through repeated penetration by different men, though not through repeated

55
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,320
penetration by the same man interestingly, and thereby come to resemble roast beef.

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
Now by definition incels haven't actually observed any vaginas, but to incels anatomy

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,520
is more a matter of metaphysical speculation than crude science.

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,000
Though if you ask me, the right metaphor for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
grapes.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,760
Of course, not all feeeemoids are created equal, there are various subspecies.

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:47,560
The Becky or Normie femoid is to be contrasted with the Stacey, or sexually desirable femoid,

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,240
whose distinguishing features include makeup on point, never works a day in her life, naturally

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,760
curvy body gives men instant erections, big tits and ass show fertility.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,600
LEAVE MY BUNS ALONE YOU SAVAGES.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,640
The Stacey, naturally, has a male counterpart, whom incels call the Chad.

66
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:16,840
A Chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared to grab nearby fertile pussy.

67
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,040
He has never heard a song in his entire life.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:28,080
He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow, rambow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
plate.

70
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,320
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a brow ridge most pronounced,

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,520
whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard, predisposing such specimens

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,920
to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,600
It's time to talk about bone structure.

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,120
According to a classic incel meme, the difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,280
millimeters of bone.

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,320
I would like to propose a sociological theory.

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Foppington's Law.

78
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community, it is only a matter of time before

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,440
deep metaphysical significance is assigned to the shape of human skulls.

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
Why skulls, you ask?

81
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,640
Well, the best explanation I can come up with is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.

82
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,400
It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics that bigots

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,760
like to assign to certain groups of people.

84
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,360
If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,000
you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying, well, that's

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,560
the reason why, it's just nature, there's nothing that can be done about it.

87
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,240
And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.

88
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Mankind is divided into two groups of people, the Chads with the fuckable skulls and the

89
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,520
incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.

90
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
Corn dog, anyone?

91
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm really hungry.

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,840
Of course it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness, they have a whole

93
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,720
dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,200
Height cells are incel due to their inferior stature, whereas mental cells can't attract

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,960
women because of mental illness or autism, or they're addicts and then called drug cells.

96
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,240
Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,120
Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.

98
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Oh yeah?

99
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,320
Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?

101
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,600
But yeah, obviously, obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's

102
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,000
is completely irrational body dysmorphia, and the reason why no one wants to be with

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,840
me or even talk to me is my shitty personality, even though literal 80 IQ men who have nothing

104
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,720
to talk about except who won the game last night are still able to attract a loving partner.

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Interesting.

106
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
A significant number of incels are not white, in which case their unfuckability is attributed

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,160
to race, and they are accordingly termed Apologies in Advance, Black Cells, Rice Cells, Curry

108
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,560
Cells, and so on.

109
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,240
Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,840
There are, of course, the occasional chads of color, with their superior skulls and towering

111
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,800
stature, whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.

112
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm so sorry.

113
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,600
So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race, but

114
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,880
what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,960
Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend, that is, escape your inceldom.

116
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,000
If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement, well,

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,440
that makes you the lowest of the low, a sad and sorry Hope Cell.

118
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Second base, the Red Pill.

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,040
So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview, the Stacys, the Chads, the incels,

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
and the normies.

121
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,160
From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality, which

122
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,520
they call the Red Pill.

123
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,160
Incels share the Red Pill worldview with the rest of the Manosphere, that is, pickup artists,

124
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
men's rights activists, and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their

125
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,840
Own Way, abbreviated MGTOW.

126
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,720
According to Red Pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.

127
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,080
Hypergamy, New Greek for marrying above, refers to the practice of seeking relationships with

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,120
men above one's social status, and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.

129
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,480
According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the

130
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,360
sexes, so if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like

131
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,800
to do, there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women as 8 out of 10 men.

132
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship

133
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,560
with his looks match, that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.

134
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,720
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women, who, regardless of their

135
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,080
own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.

136
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,360
Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule, the idea that only the top 20% of men will

137
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,040
ever be desired by women.

138
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,400
Now since most heterosexual men do end up in relationships with women, you might be

139
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,200
raising your eyebrow at that idea.

140
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,440
But incels have an explanation.

141
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,560
According to the Red Pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called Alpha-Fox-Beta-Box.

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,820
This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say, ride the cock carousel, sleeping

143
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,320
with as many Chads as possible.

144
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,680
But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a Beta-Normie whom she's not really

145
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,720
attracted to, but whom she will use for financial support, all the while continuously cuckolding

146
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,360
him on the Alpha-Cock Carousel before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything

147
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,240
he's worth on a divorce settlement, and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children

148
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,200
and a new Chad boyfriend, while the Beta-Cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments,

149
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
solitude, and poverty.

150
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,120
So the upshot of the Red Pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,280
Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,

152
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,160
or you're a Normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife

153
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,200
who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,560
Or you could be an Alpha, an independent, promiscuous man who sleeps with lots of women

155
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,840
and forms attachments to none of them.

156
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,920
In the Red Pill philosophy, there are two ways to become Alpha.

157
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,640
The first is simply to be a Chad by nature.

158
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,160
The second is to become a pickup artist.

159
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,240
Red Pill pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,

160
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,040
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,640
The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.

162
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,800
In fact, they try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of

163
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,920
strategies and scripts known as GAME, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the

164
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,640
Red Pill pickup artist Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from Benefit.

165
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,880
So the tube is a bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like, oh, it's so big.

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,640
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.

167
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
I bake my own bread.

168
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:19,560
Yes, I am outing myself as a baker, as someone who likes to cook, I'm not a woman, I am ultra-masculine

169
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,480
as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing, and men like

170
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
scientific things, I used to be a scientist.

171
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,240
So Roosh, you know what, if it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new

172
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,800
life as an ultra-masculine baker, sorry, I mean bread scientist.

173
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,040
So remember, the Red Pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%

174
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,240
or less of men are really attractive to women, dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism

175
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,440
is a pretext for enabling women to behave however they want while consigning men to

176
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,400
emasculation and impotence.

177
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,240
The Black Pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace

178
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,200
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships

179
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,200
are forever out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can

180
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,720
do except lie down and rot.

181
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,760
The Black Pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.

182
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,040
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion

183
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,960
where anxiety or depression leads you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks

184
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
and anxieties.

185
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,720
For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm going

186
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,360
to be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is going to be angry, I'm going

187
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,800
to lose my job, I'm not going to be able to get another job, I'm going to be unemployed

188
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,600
forever, my family will starve, oh god we're all going to die.

189
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is

190
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
completely absurd.

191
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,800
This is exactly how the Black Pill works.

192
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.

193
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,120
From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive

194
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women

195
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,640
did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends

196
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,160
that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only

197
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,640
option is to lie down and rot.

198
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,400
Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.

199
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,320
On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel

200
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,040
or rope fuel, meaning that they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're

201
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,480
reminders of how hopeless the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are

202
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
missing out on the incredible bliss of sex and romance.

203
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,160
Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely

204
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,160
and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's

205
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,200
just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here.

206
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,320
But a lot of the suicidal stuff shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people

207
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,660
express pretty extreme states of depression, which is not surprising, since hopelessness

208
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,720
is the logical conclusion of the Black Pill worldview.

209
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,000
Women's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
bone structure.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,720
And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.

212
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,840
Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.

213
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,920
You want to grab them by their Black Ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are

214
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're

215
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,440
their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some

216
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,160
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows, maybe they'll develop a disposition

217
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,520
that women find a little more approachable.

218
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,720
Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.

219
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,520
In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,

220
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,960
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need

221
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,920
to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.

222
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,640
But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.

223
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,360
In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.

224
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,240
You are, in effect, Chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take

225
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
a shower, be more confident, to people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection

226
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,240
and isolation, and who believe they've already tried everything.

227
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,120
So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility

228
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,960
and insensitivity of it.

229
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
Just go out to parties, bro.

230
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,800
Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident, like

231
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
this average looking guy.

232
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,760
Confidence is key.

233
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,840
You incels need some hobbies.

234
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Try reading some books.

235
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Women love intelligence.

236
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
It works for me, bro.

237
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Aw, you just need to get out more.

238
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,840
No one knows what it's like to be hated

239
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,320
To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who

240
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
would try to change their minds.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So if you want to understand incels, and in particular if you want to understand why their

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,800
community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill

243
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,520
is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.

244
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,840
It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.

245
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,520
So what we have in our hands here is more than a bunch of angry internet misogynists.

246
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,760
It's, at worst, a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.

247
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,120
It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since

248
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,040
triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?

249
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,400
Third base.

250
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Tinder is garbage.

251
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,520
I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want

252
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,320
my sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil, but

253
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,120
on some level I can't help it.

254
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,800
The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the

255
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
same way.

256
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,360
I bet some of you have been this guy.

257
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,160
I have been this guy.

258
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,200
So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this

259
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,440
channel so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.

260
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,520
And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.

261
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who

262
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
dates women.

263
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,720
What kind of fucked up shit is that?

264
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,160
Is that even allowed?

265
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,000
Alright, calm down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,480
And those who lieth betwixt.

267
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Cats.

268
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,640
The inherent eroticism of the sea.

269
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,280
Mmm, yeah, don't you just want to get in there?

270
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Take me, mommy.

271
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.

272
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,760
I gotta get my hetero on.

273
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,240
What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women, and as a woman

274
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
seeking men.

275
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,360
And I think that gives me some relevant experiences.

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,360
When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women

277
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,000
get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive

279
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
the inquiries.

280
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Let's see how we're doing here.

281
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
How many men have liked me on Tinder?

282
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.

283
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,400
I have 2,500 likes.

284
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
That's a lot of Baltimorean men who swiped right on a tran.

285
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,440
What a divine city.

286
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,160
Aw, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.

287
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Let's see what kind of messages I got.

288
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,480
DICK OR NO DICK?

289
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,280
PRE-OP OR POST-OP?

290
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,680
DID YOU CUT YOUR DICK OFF?

291
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,240
Oh my god.

292
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm gonna cut it off, okay, Jesus.

293
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,320
I will let you smash my pussies, so, so hard, if you just be patient.

294
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
It's a whole process.

295
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
That's not a pussy.

296
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
That's a fuckhole.

297
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,320
You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.

298
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,040
Well, that's true.

299
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,880
I am not going to be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong,

300
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,800
and I assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will

301
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
be sacred.

302
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,440
So y'all, leave my fuckhole out of this.

303
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,680
When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.

304
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,560
He was going to take me to a concert, I was like, seems like a lot for a first date, but

305
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
we'll try it.

306
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,680
15 minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.

307
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,540
What color panties are you wearing?

308
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,080
I would love to smell them.

309
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,240
Can we get coffee first?

310
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,600
The hell of it is, I probably would have let him smell my panties, but this is a thing

311
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,880
you bring up on the third fuck, you don't open with panty sniffing.

312
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,160
Like the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're going to murder

313
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
me, and you're already fucking it up.

314
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
So this is the experience of women on Tinder.

315
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We're drowning in dick, and most of it is terrible.

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,960
Not all, I do have some very sweet messages, and I haven't been using the app in a couple

317
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,360
months so if I didn't respond to you or if we didn't match, it's not because I rejected

318
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,840
you, it's because I don't like the app.

319
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,680
People screenshot my profile and they post it online, and they call me ContraPoints

320
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,000
and I, like, I'm just too famous for this shit.

321
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
My life is hard.

322
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,560
So girls, we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad dicks that's constantly

323
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,000
pointed at us in dating apps, but how would you feel if instead of that, you were just

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
getting radio silence like the incels get?

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't speak for other women, but personally, I prefer the firing squad of dicks, you know?

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,800
At least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick.

327
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,880
I feel sorry for men on dating apps, I really do.

328
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,200
You have to deal with a lot of rejection, and that must be difficult.

329
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
These apps are especially brutal to people who aren't photogenic.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,520
If you're meeting people at a bar or a party, you might strike up a conversation with someone

331
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,800
who you're not initially physically attracted to, but then maybe they're super funny or

332
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,680
charming or maybe they're attracted to me, and that's an attractive quality in another

333
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,160
person, that they appreciate how beautiful I am.

334
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,400
But on Tinder, you're just browsing a catalog of faces, and gatekeeping who even gets to

335
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
talk to you in the first place.

336
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,960
Red Pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value,

337
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,680
but like, dating kind of is a marketplace, or at least you can analyze it like one.

338
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,240
And our culture is so visual, and these apps are so picture-centered, that bone structure,

339
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,280
like it's not the only thing that matters, but it matters a great deal.

340
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,480
And this is where I do have sympathy for the incels.

341
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Because as a trans woman, I know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone.

342
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,280
I actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization

343
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,760
surgery, so I can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone

344
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,360
here and there, because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibiteth a

345
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,080
brow ridge less pronounced.

346
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,680
I mean, I'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn incels, because I think certain

347
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,600
parts of my face make me look like a man, and I worry about it every day.

348
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,760
We're all obsessed with the bones, honey.

349
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,560
We all have bones inside us, we all love touching bones.

350
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:28,600
You wanna take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture, and multiply

351
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,880
that figure by pi to calculate what we call the Chad Circumference.

352
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,280
Why is no one talking about the Chad Circumference?

353
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,760
Fourth base, just the tip.

354
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,720
There's another way I think my experience, as a trans woman, is relevant to the incel

355
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,120
discussion, and that's that I recognize delusional self-loathing when I see it.

356
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,840
I'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer Elliot

357
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,360
Roger was, apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality, an eminently bangable twink.

358
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,440
Now I'm not going to show you pictures of incels, but on their forums they do sometimes

359
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,880
post selfie threads.

360
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,880
And you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them, but in confidence, from one

361
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,480
pretend clinician to another, let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost

362
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,200
all of them are completely normal looking guys.

363
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,480
But of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels.

364
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,920
The feedback they get is that their chins are weak, their hair is thin, their skin is

365
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
garbage, and there's no hope whatsoever, no woman will ever love them, and they are true

366
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,080
cells with no option but to lie down and rot.

367
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,440
And the interesting thing is, those guys post selfies to those threads knowing that's the

368
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
kind of feedback they're gonna get.

369
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,480
So why?

370
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,760
Why do they do it?

371
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Well, I'll tell you a little story.

372
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,440
There is a website on the internet called 4chan.org that has a board called LGBT.

373
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,720
A few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who actually like Milo Yiannopoulos,

374
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:03,240
but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining the notion of becoming women,

375
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,600
and by early transition trans women, so the board is jokingly called TTTT.

376
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,400
I've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition, but the memory is still

377
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,920
fresh, and let me tell you, it is a painful, awkward, humiliating stage of life.

378
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,280
So the trans women of TTTT are tragic.

379
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,560
They're basically still in man mode, which is why they're using 4chan.

380
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,800
And I bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels.

381
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,240
For incels, the core frustration is that they can't get laid.

382
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,000
For TTTT, it's that they can't pass as female.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,080
Both groups post selfies knowing they're gonna get brutal, unconstructive feedback,

384
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,840
and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their anxieties.

385
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,400
For instance, on TTTT, a major piece of jargon is hun,

386
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,080
a slur used by trans women for other trans women,

387
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,040
which basically means that you look like a man in a dress,

388
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,120
which is what every trans woman is afraid of.

389
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,600
And there's another commonality with incels too, with all bigots and self-loathers,

390
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,120
which, if you've been paying attention, you've already guessed.

391
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,960
You will never be seen as a woman because of your head size.

392
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
Have all the surgeries in the world.

393
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,520
Your massive man noggin will stay the same.

394
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,040
Lel, this freak thinks he has very soft facial features.

395
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,920
His head is fucking huge, Lel.

396
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,160
And the huns on Reddit are hugboxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads.

397
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,240
Uh, no there aren't.

398
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,160
There aren't fucking women with heads the size of that.

399
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,760
And FFS won't change shit.

400
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
You might as well repress.

401
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,480
You transition with a man's head.

402
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,200
You will be clocked.

403
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
You will be looked at as a freak.

404
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,360
You will never be seen as a legit woman, 100%.

405
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,240
This is why I'm not transitioning.

406
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,320
Thank you, skull people, for showing me the way,

407
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,200
and that no matter what I do I will always be a manly man skull-wise.

408
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,360
You saved me the embarrassment of being a literal big-headed man in a dress.

409
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,600
"'Tis evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous,

410
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,000
and the facial plane wider.

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,200
It always comes back to the skulls, every time."

412
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,080
The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.

413
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,480
For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.

414
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,840
Yikes.

415
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,240
Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.

416
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,400
If I'm not looked at as a big-skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,

417
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,000
that means that some of their transitions might go well too.

418
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,600
And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.

419
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,200
So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,

420
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,240
why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me

421
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,840
shouldn't even fucking think about it.

422
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,280
They shouldn't transition at all.

423
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,560
They should just repress.

424
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,160
They should lie down and rot.

425
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,760
And I used to read this stuff all the time.

426
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,480
Like I would specifically seek out threads about me.

427
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,520
Which might seem strange considering I had hundreds of fans

428
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
telling me I was a gorgeous goddess every day.

429
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,600
So why did I turn away from that?

430
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,360
To intentionally seek out this dismal den of huns talking about

431
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,720
how my giant hun skull is clockable at a thousand paces

432
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,320
and my voice sounds like a ridiculous muppet falsetto hybrid of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh?

433
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,560
Well basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it

434
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,480
when people told me I was gorgeous.

435
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,040
And for semi-plausible reasons.

436
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,720
A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous

437
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,160
no matter what they look like.

438
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,480
That's where the word hun comes from.

439
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,440
You look great hun.

440
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,840
So what TTTT is saying about reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.

441
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,760
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.

442
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,280
So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful,

443
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,960
politically correct cuckoldry.

444
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,240
And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT

445
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,480
and reading other people's saying what my deepest anxieties told me was really true.

446
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,400
And that was always painful.

447
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,480
But there was a kind of pleasure too.

448
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,680
There was a rush.

449
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,400
It's exciting to burst out of the politically correct bubble

450
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,840
and say what you're really thinking.

451
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,360
That personality doesn't matter because big-skulled chads get all the girls.

452
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,200
That ContraPoints is a big-skulled hun with a voice like nails on a chalkboard.

453
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,520
And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.

454
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.

455
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,520
It's simply my job.

456
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,840
But soon I realized it wasn't just research.

457
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,920
And it was infecting me away from the computer.

458
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
This ridiculous vocabulary.

459
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,840
Huns. AGP.

460
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,480
Was popping up in my head at unexpected times.

461
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,880
It was starting to color how I thought about myself.

462
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,040
And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.

463
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,320
And that's the moment I realized I need to stop looking at this stuff right now

464
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,000
or I'm going to become a monster.

465
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,720
And once that happens it's going to be very difficult to fix.

466
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,120
This is exactly how the incel black pill works.

467
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,520
There's something infectious about these vocabularies.

468
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,840
Like on days I've been working on this video,

469
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll go out at night and these words just involuntarily show up in my thoughts.

470
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,240
That bartender is such a chad.

471
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,320
He's totally height mocking that tiny cock.

472
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,240
And the tragic thing is some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds

473
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,440
until it's too late.

474
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,320
Let's face it.

475
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,200
Black pills are suey fuel.

476
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,520
And a lot of us can't handle them.

477
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,720
I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it

478
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,880
since I loved uncovering secrets that society had been hiding from me.

479
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,880
But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.

480
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,080
I made my first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago

481
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,040
and I've never needed to do that before.

482
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,360
I could always talk myself out of it through logic,

483
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,880
but my mind is ruined now.

484
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,440
This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,

485
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,680
prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.

486
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,760
But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out

487
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,280
abusive and disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.

488
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,360
I have a long history of doing this,

489
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,440
intentionally looking for abusive comments,

490
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,840
especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.

491
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,640
Why?

492
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't know.

493
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,680
Why do people cut themselves?

494
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,440
Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.

495
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,280
Whatever hurts is true.

496
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,360
I've recently gotten much better about this.

497
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,240
I haven't been to any of the worst places in a couple months.

498
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,280
And my mental health has much improved.

499
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,440
So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position

500
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,800
worthy of rational debate.

501
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,280
Because these ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments.

502
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,840
You're using them as razor blades to abuse yourselves.

503
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,240
And I know, because I've done the exact same thing.

504
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,640
The incel worldview is catastrophizing.

505
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,160
It's an anxious death spiral.

506
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,600
And the solution to that has to be therapeutic, not logical.

507
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,880
A lot of you are lonely.

508
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,560
You've been bullied and neglected.

509
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,480
You feel left behind by society.

510
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,400
But what you're doing when you're reading incel forums is you're slowly internalizing

511
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,280
a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves, and at other people in your situation, and

512
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,920
at women.

513
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,040
And you're forming mental habits that are going to make it very difficult for you to

514
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
live a happy life.

515
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,520
So what you have to do is get off those forums as fast as possible.

516
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm going to post a link in the description of this video to instructions on how to block

517
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,880
certain websites from your computer, because for me, that's what it took.

518
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,120
Fifth base.

519
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,080
Anal.

520
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,760
So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit.

521
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,440
And that limit is that for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred

522
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,400
is not directed at themselves, but at women.

523
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
And they really hate women.

524
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry scholar at this point.

525
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,240
I look at this kind of stuff all the time.

526
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,280
Researching this video, I was honestly kind of shocked at the intensity of misogyny on

527
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,240
incel forums.

528
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape, saying they

529
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,840
deserve to be raped, calls for state-mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but most of all

530
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,680
just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.

531
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
I hate women.

532
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,560
I really do.

533
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,480
Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof.

534
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,240
When they're gabbing on the cell phone about Paris Hilton.

535
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,120
When they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time, rifling through their stupid

536
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,680
purse.

537
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,320
When they whine to me about their period.

538
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,760
When they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician nobody gives a flipping

539
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,560
fuck about.

540
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,680
When they cry and expect your personal sympathy.

541
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,200
But most of all, I hate them because they're smug, hyperactive little bitches made that

542
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,320
way by our shithole society.

543
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,920
Look what uncontrolled feminism and the media has done.

544
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Hi Stacey, it's Tracey.

545
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,600
Well I was at the mall the other day with Amber, Heather, Jenna, and Trish and we were

546
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,200
talking about Paris Hilton, a very relevant cultural figure in 2018.

547
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,720
They live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking of women

548
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,600
as fully human.

549
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,760
And that's where my sympathy runs dry, because this kind of hatred just needs a spark to

550
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
turn to violence.

551
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,480
So incels, I know you're not going to listen to anything I say, and you're just going

552
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,880
to say that I'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate.

553
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,640
And to that I say, how dare you say things that are entirely true.

554
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,040
But also, vol sol if you wouldn't, bitches.

555
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,240
And I know you don't listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have

556
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,480
healthy relationships, so no one can really reach you until you get out of those forums

557
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,000
and allow yourselves to be reached.

558
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,160
But by way of a closing remark, I guess I simply invite you to consider that you don't

559
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,920
even need a warm body or a sex robot to satisfy the erotic longing.

560
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,120
You know, when I was your age in 1975, every teenage boy had a Stratocaster in his bedroom

561
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
that was the outlet for his sexual frustration.

562
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,240
What I'm suggesting is the Manosphere exists because rock and roll is dead.

563
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,760
But there's other options.

564
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,640
Think about the eroticism of a rainstorm.

565
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,040
The clap of thunder.

566
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,000
The rustle of leaves.

567
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,080
The steam rising off the warm pavement.

568
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,880
And whether you're a Chad, a Stacey, an Incel, or a Hun, you can always return to the caress

569
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:31,080
of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.

570
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,080
Is it just me?
