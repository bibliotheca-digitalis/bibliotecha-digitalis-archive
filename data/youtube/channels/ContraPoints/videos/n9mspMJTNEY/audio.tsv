0	8760	My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front
8760	17240	My shop is the fake side front I'm real when I shop my face
30000	38320	Hey guys, it's Natalie.
38320	39880	Welcome back to my channel.
39880	42560	Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always.
42560	45760	But first, story time, story time, story time.
45760	50000	I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.
50000	53200	I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean
53200	54560	so much to me.
54560	57940	Like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story.
57940	58940	My whole entire journey.
58980	61440	This journey I've been on as a transgender woman.
61440	62860	You've been with me on this whole journey.
62860	63980	This is my truth.
63980	65120	You've accepted the truth of my journey.
65120	68680	This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've
68680	72080	been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.
72080	77380	The whole message of my journey as an influencer.
77380	83340	The vulnerable moment of truth and the lived experience of my life and the truth of my
83340	84340	life.
84340	93420	I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of
93420	96420	fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.
96420	98100	Anyway let's talk about plastic surgery.
98100	102260	I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.
102260	107260	What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures
107260	110660	that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.
110660	116340	So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring,
116340	117340	a trachea shave.
117340	120060	You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.
120060	126940	A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault whence the skin of the forehead was
126940	129340	stripped away from the bone.
129340	137140	A fragment of the supraorbital ridge was then chiseled away, removed, reshaped, and reaffixed
137140	144500	thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that of times distinguisheth
144500	146900	the skull of the chad.
146900	153820	A second incision was made athwart the columella of the nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction
153820	157460	of the anterior cartilage and bone.
157460	163860	Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped
163860	171100	and shaved down to a gracile curvature of jaw and pointed chin, thereby delineating
171100	176900	a facial silhouette exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.
176900	180020	It all sounds pretty gruesome when you describe it like that, but there's actually a very
180020	183020	fine level of technique and aesthetics involved.
183020	185300	My plastic surgeon is an artist.
185300	189020	The results are natural, I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done, which is good,
189020	192420	you know, you at least want to leave people wondering, maybe she's born with it, maybe
192420	194780	a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull.
194780	197780	Here's a before and after picture where you can clearly see the difference.
197780	201700	To use the exact medical terminology, my brow's on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the
201700	205140	house, my jaw's snatched, and my Adam's apple is cancelled.
205140	206740	Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?
206740	207860	Maybe Satan's apple?
207860	211940	I think I still look like myself, it's not a new face, we're talking about millimeters
211940	212940	of bone here.
212940	218580	But to have all that done was, well, it cost a lot of money, the anticipation was oh, terror
218740	224140	like I've never known, the pain was memorable, and the recovery took more than a month, in
224140	226140	fact I still have some swelling in my jowls.
226140	229180	Jowls, there's a nice feminine-sounding word, love that.
229180	233260	The standard YouTube t-girl thing to do, of course, would've been to vlog the whole journey.
233260	237900	Story time, my facial surgery experience, my FFS journey, and post constant social media
237900	238900	updates about it.
238900	242580	And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that, because it was really helpful to
242580	247300	me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what I was getting myself into.
247300	251620	But I decided not to post about the surgery, because I wanted privacy for the recovery,
251620	255460	and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before subjecting
255460	258220	myself to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.
258220	262660	You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people
262660	264140	say about my appearance online.
264140	268700	And I'm not even talking about the haters, like at this point I can mostly brush them off.
268700	272300	But for instance, about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit, and some
272300	276100	trans woman was agonizing about her appearance, and someone offered the encouragement,
276420	279820	You know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.
279820	280820	Just look at ContraPoints.
280820	281820	Ugh.
281820	284140	Like a dagger to the heart.
284140	286180	The unintentional shade of it all.
286180	291980	So the past six weeks have been, at times, difficult and lonely, but I did manage to
291980	296340	keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be
296340	298500	for the commentary of the internet.
298500	300500	So bring it on you jackals.
300500	301500	You vultures.
301500	302500	You goblin swine.
302820	306620	While I was lying around bandaged and bored, I did have a lot of time to think.
306620	310780	And what I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,
310780	314620	which is, why would someone do what I just did?
314620	319340	Why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much anxiety and pain just to
319340	321380	change a few millimeters of bone?
321380	323860	Isn't this all just extravagant vanity?
323860	326540	Some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?
326540	331620	Well I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me to say that in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.
331740	335380	Usually trans people say that surgeries like facial feminization, top surgery, genital
335380	340940	reassignment, and so on serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria, this discomfort
340940	344780	we feel with the mismatch between our bodies and our gender identity.
344780	349620	So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically necessary reconstructive procedure
349620	355020	needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones match the 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio
355020	360020	girl I truly am inside, thereby alleviating my dysphoria, helping me safely blend into
360020	363460	society, and preventing a 5 alarm psychiatric meltdown.
363460	367100	And there is definitely truth to that, it's certainly the argument I intend to make when
367100	369860	I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.
369860	374140	If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now and insert the next floppy disk
374140	375500	into your CD drive.
375500	380180	But hypothetically speaking, I think the reality might not be quite so simple.
380180	384660	How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the other kinds of body image dysphoria
384660	388500	that drive cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the time?
388500	393740	Last year, when I used a foolishly tweet-things-of-substance, I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS, and some
393740	398020	trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia and
398020	399020	self-loathing.
399020	403100	They compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery, or so-called ethnic
403100	407380	rhinoplasty, which they say are motivated by internalized racism and Western beauty
407380	408380	standards.
408380	412140	I think that's a pretty weak analogy, and telling a trans person to just learn to accept
412140	417060	the way they look can actually be kinda transphobic, because a big part of what it even means to
417060	420700	be trans, at least for me, is the desire to look more female.
420700	425980	But I also think trans people often talk like gender dysphoria is this intrinsic, personal
425980	431080	experience that's always 100% valid and never has anything at all to do with the external
431080	432860	pressure of beauty standards.
432860	437160	But in fact, gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of
437160	438700	societal ideals and norms.
438700	443820	Early in my transition, some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair, so I had full-body laser
443820	447380	hair removal, and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg.
447380	450260	But where does the idea that women don't have body hair come from?
450260	452700	Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?
452700	457140	A lot of the cis women I know don't so much as shave their legs, so maybe I'm not even
457140	459060	trying to look like a cis woman.
459060	464260	Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a
464260	470260	knuckly, hairy, BOOM, mannish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my
470260	471260	core.
471260	477220	Is this gender dysphoria, or is it internalized transphobia, or is it simply a cosmetic preference?
477220	483180	When I try to psychoanalyze myself, I find that my desires to look female, to look feminine,
483180	488300	and to look beautiful are not exactly the same, but they're woven together so tightly
488300	490500	that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.
490500	495860	And the opposite is also true, that for me, feeling mannish or dysphoric usually goes
495860	497660	along with feeling ugly.
497660	501300	I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking, well, I'm giving femme
501300	504300	queen realness, but apart from that I look like absolute shit.
504300	508580	Of course there are qualities that make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive,
508580	513900	like cellulite or flabby arms, which are superfish but aren't deemed beautiful by society.
513900	518380	The truth is, I don't just want to look female, I want to be beautiful.
518380	519380	Desperately.
519380	520940	God, I'll do anything.
520940	521940	Anything.
521940	526620	In this video, I want to explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful, and why it
526620	530300	seems like a lot of people who live in a society are so obsessed.
530300	531300	Is it phones?
531300	532300	It's probably phones.
532300	536060	I know you're supposed to pretend that you don't care about being beautiful or that you're
536060	539540	not trying, but guys, it's the only thing I care about and I've never tried so hard
539540	540540	at anything.
540540	543940	Of course, I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it, because there's this idea
543940	547060	that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.
547060	551260	You know, smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty, and I've always been categorized
551260	553740	as a smart person by people around me.
553740	557500	Some of that is when you're raised like I was, as a middle-class white boy with no athletic
557500	562820	talent, parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius, like Einstein nutted a load
562820	567180	in Mozart's bussy and Mozart shat you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from
567180	568420	Vincent van Gogh.
568420	570740	It inspired his famous painting, Starfish Night.
570740	574020	But even among women, caring about beauty is often frowned upon.
574020	578700	I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia, and I know a few because
578700	583020	I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a, uh, what do you call someone
583020	584020	who makes videos?
584020	585260	A cam girl.
585260	588220	Most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup.
588220	593140	To them, the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable.
593140	594340	Like maybe on Halloween.
594340	598580	Now part of that is that women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present
598580	603380	more masculine to be taken seriously, because of this prejudice that beautified femininity
603380	604780	equals frivolous.
604780	608260	But another part is clearly some kind of not-like-other-girls weird flex.
608260	612760	Which okay, fine, whatever, I'm not gonna judge another woman for the way she copes
612760	616960	with a society that pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling
616960	618280	them for caring about it.
618280	623920	I guess my way of coping is this tacky, heteronormative, and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind
623920	626160	of post-ironic feminine beauty.
626160	627160	Why am I like this?
627160	630640	Well part of it is vindictive transsexualism, pure and simple.
630640	634640	To all the people who've ever called me a man, I wanna say, fuck you, by looking like
634640	639840	the undeniable visual archetype of a woman, which is a beautiful feminine woman.
640640	643720	Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.
643720	645160	They're biological sequins.
645160	646160	Uh.
646160	647160	Ooh.
647160	651960	That is some ASMR right there, listen to that.
651960	652960	Oh.
662960	665000	Another factor is this shitty website.
665040	670280	I'm a professional YouTube influencer, forgive me father, and I'm on camera all the time.
670280	675160	I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month staring at my own face on
675160	676160	a screen.
676160	679160	Now you try doing that and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.
679160	682400	Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.
682400	687080	A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young and so beautiful it makes me wanna throw up.
687080	693040	And in comparison, for a long time I've felt like this shabby, aging transvestite.
693080	696680	It's this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.
696680	701360	So I'm insecure, I'm compensating for that whole mess, but I honestly don't resent the
701360	704600	beautiful people, I really just stan the hell out of them.
704600	707680	I follow this woman on YouTube and I wanna be just like her mom.
707680	710200	Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.
710200	716840	Her name is Lady Jane McLean, Signora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials, Tatiana Petrovna Westbrokova,
716840	720160	and of course my queen and perfect goddess whomst I stan and whose portrait I've painted
720160	721160	hundreds of times.
721280	724920	So there's maybe some extra intensity for me, but I think it's actually pretty normal
724920	725920	to wanna be beautiful.
725920	729720	I think even grad students wanna be beautiful, they just wanna do it in that Becky kind of
729720	732560	way where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.
732560	734520	And it's not just women who care about beauty either.
734520	738680	I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery, but now even the straights
738680	739680	are doing it.
739680	743720	Incels are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal appearance, and the ones
743720	746920	who aren't completely blackpilled are obsessed with plastic surgery.
746920	751520	The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing, because of course they have to go about this
751520	753320	in the most heterosexual possible way.
753320	757640	It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen in order to maximize looks-money status and
757640	759120	secure access to females.
759120	760520	Oh my god, calm down.
760520	764360	Not every sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.
764360	767800	Yes, they actually call skin care SKIN-MAXING.
767800	771240	James Charles, I know you're having a hard month, but I've got a business idea that's
771240	772880	gonna turn this thing around for you.
772880	773880	Here's the plan.
773880	778680	You're gonna create a new line of skin care products called CHADGLOW, bribe PewDiePie
778680	784000	to send his fans to the promo video, hi sister cells, and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.
784000	789200	If you read looks-max forums, they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants, chin implants,
789200	790520	mandible implants.
790520	798440	It must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.
798440	801400	It's literally facial masculinization surgery.
801440	806280	So everyone's obsessed with the bones, everyone's obsessed with beauty, whether man or woman,
806280	809200	cis or trans, gay or gamer.
809200	813440	Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin' while everyone else has completely lost their minds.
813440	814440	But why?
814440	816000	Why do we care so much?
816000	820760	Well with incels, by their own account, the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing
820760	825560	will make femoids have sex with them, and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful.
825560	828280	Which, um, it will not.
828280	829840	So incels are cancelled.
829840	830840	Now what about women?
830840	831840	What's our deal?
831840	832840	What's our sitch?
832840	833840	What's our vibe?
833840	834840	What's our vige?
834840	837760	Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels, that we care about beauty
837760	841600	and wear makeup, fake up, because we're trying to attract men.
841600	845280	My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year and said that women wear makeup because they're
845280	849280	trying to stimulate male sexual arousal and because evolution.
849280	854600	Now at the risk of being bratty, I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.
854600	858200	For one thing, straight men don't like makeup, at least they don't think they do.
858320	861960	Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about
861960	862960	makeup.
862960	864040	Yes, I asked all of them.
864040	866680	If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.
866680	869480	And I actually do look diseased when I don't wear makeup, so fair enough.
869480	873960	If you wear natural makeup, you know, a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip, they
873960	876240	think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.
876240	880640	If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow, heavy contouring, overdrawn lips, they think
880640	881960	it's dumb and they hate it.
881960	885600	Of course I'm generalizing, hashtag not all daddy Doms.
885600	889720	But if women really wore makeup to attract men, then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing
889720	893040	it when there are no men around, but that doesn't happen.
893040	897000	About a month ago there was that video going around of a woman showing how to make jailhouse
897000	901680	makeup, mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow, using Kool-Aid and Vaseline
901680	902680	to make lipstick.
902680	906400	There's not a lot of men in women's prison, but women are still performing incredible
906400	910020	feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.
910020	915480	So maybe women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity, you know,
915480	917720	things that prison tries to take away from you.
917720	918720	Kinda makes sense.
918720	923800	There's a Refinery29 documentary about prison cosmetology, and also sexual exploitation,
923800	927720	yikes, in which a former inmate describes how women would engage in sexual bartering
927720	929720	with male guards just to get makeup.
929720	935840	If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer, he would bring her in colored pencils,
935840	937440	lip gloss, things like that.
937440	941880	That's right, women are sucking dicks that they can put on makeup, not the other way
941880	942880	around.
942880	946360	If all the men died tomorrow, F, I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.
946360	947680	In fact, I might wear more.
947680	951400	And I'm not just saying that cos I'm trying to win feminist points or anything, like,
951400	952720	do I want to attract men?
952720	954200	Yes, of course I do.
954200	955200	Do I want to attract women?
955200	956200	I guess.
956200	958200	I don't really think about it.
958200	963120	Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?
963120	965040	Whatever, it's fine.
965040	969000	I want to attract non-binary people too, of course, but right now you guys are kind of
969000	974080	getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender, so how dare you.
974080	977720	The point is, when I think about my appearance, wanting to attract people to have sex with
977720	979960	is not the main thing going through my head.
979960	981200	What is going through my head?
981200	987340	🎵
987340	991440	I guess I just want to feel beautiful, I want to see myself in the mirror and think I look
991440	992920	snatched, is that a crime?
992920	994400	I don't feel pretty very often.
994400	996280	I'd say it happens about once a month.
996440	1002000	When I'm having a good skin day, I do my makeup just right, I glisten with setting spray,
1002000	1003000	and then it happens.
1003000	1005320	A tingle goes up my spine.
1005320	1007440	I am Botticelli.
1007440	1009560	I am Van Gogh.
1009560	1012480	I have created beauty.
1012480	1015240	I'm a girl.
1015240	1016240	And then it's over.
1016240	1017240	That's it for a month.
1017240	1020200	Usually when I look in the mirror, I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.
1020200	1023920	Like with other people, I can just look at them and instantly make a judgment about it,
1023920	1026440	but with myself, I have to just guess.
1026440	1030400	It's the same as being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass.
1030400	1032240	Would you clock me?
1032240	1034200	I'd clock me.
1034200	1035200	I'd fuck me too.
1035200	1036200	I don't give a shit.
1036200	1038600	Get out of my room, mom!
1038600	1039720	It doesn't work like that for me.
1039720	1042040	I have to rely on other people's feedback.
1042040	1046600	Of course, the problem with other people's feedback is that people are liars.
1046600	1050920	You look great, hon, especially when those people are your fans.
1050920	1053960	Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat, mother, I'll die for you!
1053960	1054960	Oh my god.
1054960	1056400	Or when they're your haters.
1056400	1061360	Your disgusting, giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces.
1061360	1063160	I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.
1063160	1068440	But I can estimate, like, I have figured out that I'm too pretty for Twitter, but I'm
1068440	1071240	not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.
1071240	1072480	It's hard being a six.
1072480	1075040	I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.
1075040	1078680	Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup
1078720	1083400	looks, and what I find addictive about it is this constant flow of positive comments
1083400	1086560	from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.
1086560	1089640	You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy!
1089640	1093360	Every time I get a comment like that, I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration
1093360	1098520	fueled by parasocial delusions, but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically female
1098520	1099520	brain.
1099520	1102800	And the intoxicating thing about Instagram is that the embellishment of the truth is
1102800	1105880	a two-way street, thanks to the miracle of Facetune.
1105880	1108600	Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.
1108600	1112720	See, it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul.
1112720	1113720	Get it?
1113720	1115280	Should I explain it again?
1115280	1116880	Phones live in a society.
1116880	1120160	Facetune is an app that lets you fix all the problems with your face.
1120160	1122920	So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.
1122920	1126960	What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion, shrink the nose a little,
1126960	1130440	bring the jaw in, and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.
1130440	1134080	It's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo-doctoring people have been doing
1134080	1135800	since the invention of photography.
1136000	1140640	What's changed is that now everyone is doing it to their own photos every day.
1140640	1144800	And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit of editing my flaws out of pictures,
1144800	1148560	when I look at an unedited picture of myself, or when I look in the mirror,
1148560	1151520	my eyes go straight to the flaws.
1151520	1153780	Why are my pores so big?
1153780	1157240	Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?
1157240	1159760	Is this really a good use of my mental energy?
1159760	1161360	Here comes that guilt again.
1161360	1164800	Instead of worrying about my pores, shouldn't I be helping stop the impending
1164800	1168560	climate catastrophe that's gonna destroy the planet if we don't change the economy
1168560	1169560	in like 12 years?
1169560	1171440	Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.
1171440	1174880	It's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much else on my mind.
1174880	1180880	🎵
1180880	1182080	He's just so cute.
1182080	1185880	I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic than the apocalypse.
1185880	1187400	And that's the darkness.
1187400	1190960	Why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin?
1190960	1193640	Do I need Botox yet?
1193640	1194640	Should I get a facelift?
1194640	1198680	These are the questions that will no doubt define the next couple decades of my life.
1198680	1202520	As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence on camera,
1202520	1207240	I also have to deal with aging, and thus the ritual of skincare products.
1207240	1209080	Here's my daytime routine.
1209080	1215000	So first I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.
1215000	1218600	None of this is sponsored by the way, this is just me supporting corporations out of
1218600	1221240	the kindness of my heart.
1221240	1226360	Now if I'm not running late for something, I will do a face mask, but if I'm out of bed,
1226360	1230600	it's because I'm running late for something, so...
1230600	1232440	I've never done a face mask.
1232440	1235320	Now I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.
1235320	1241320	Now a lot of people don't know what a toner does, but um...
1241320	1242920	Look it tones okay!
1242920	1244920	Do you want your face to be untoned?
1244920	1249480	Next I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.
1249480	1252520	I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper than the Japanese yeast,
1252520	1254680	so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.
1254680	1255800	Think of the savings.
1255800	1261240	Now I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.
1262120	1264920	You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.
1264920	1266440	It's enchanting, it's like I'm there.
1266440	1269080	There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.
1269080	1274280	I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to, and I do everything Gigi says.
1274280	1275720	Every fucking thing.
1275720	1277320	I know it seems like a lot of products,
1277320	1281000	but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,
1281000	1283160	the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
1283160	1284840	I feel like I'm forgetting something.
1284840	1285720	A sunscreen.
1286280	1287640	I'm not really sure what this does.
1288200	1289320	We can probably skip it.
1289320	1292840	And I'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive mist.
1293880	1296440	Yes god, I love a good facial.
1296440	1298760	I'm so fucking wet right now.
1298760	1303240	So after all these products, does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?
1303800	1308520	Well, it's hard to say for sure, but it certainly is moist.
1308520	1311800	This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face for 10 minutes
1311800	1315480	and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time.
1325480	1326280	I'm fine.
1327320	1328520	It's, it's fine.
1328520	1329240	This is fine.
1330280	1330840	It's fine.
1331800	1335960	Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas.
1335960	1340040	For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
1340760	1344680	Leastwise I shall bequeath a female skull.
1347320	1352440	So isn't beauty supposed to be fun?
1353000	1354840	I'm not having fun right now.
1354840	1356440	Why am I not having fun?
1356920	1358920	I'm not having fun right now.
1358920	1360760	Why am I not having fun?
1360760	1363160	I guess I just don't feel beautiful.
1363160	1365000	And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,
1365000	1367400	and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,
1367400	1368920	and I know I should be grateful,
1368920	1371960	and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,
1371960	1375080	and I know I shouldn't care so much about this in the first place.
1375080	1378840	But the truth is that this just eats away at me,
1378840	1382200	and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.
1382200	1384600	I've been kind of depressed this past month,
1384600	1387720	and I think part of it is that, on a subconscious level,
1387720	1391640	I think I was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image
1391640	1393320	and make me like myself.
1393320	1395000	But it really hasn't.
1395000	1398120	I mean, I'm happy with the results, I'd do it all again.
1398120	1401000	But I still feel the way I felt before.
1401000	1405160	You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific problems,
1405160	1406680	like the Adam's apple problem,
1406680	1409320	or the way my forehead looks and profile problem.
1409320	1413720	But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.
1413720	1415800	I still don't feel beautiful,
1415800	1419160	and I need to face the fact that I'm never going to feel beautiful
1419160	1421080	unless I change the way I think.
1421080	1423480	Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,
1423480	1425000	and if I'm ever gonna get out,
1425000	1427640	I think I need to start by forgiving myself
1427640	1429400	for wanting to be beautiful.
1429400	1431640	There's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful
1431640	1433800	besides being shallow and vain.
1433800	1436600	For one, beauty is associated with youth.
1436600	1439800	It's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.
1439800	1442200	That's a profound thing to be concerned about.
1442280	1445000	See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.
1445000	1447320	Beauty is also associated with moral worth,
1447320	1449960	the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.
1449960	1452440	There's studies showing that conventionally attractive people
1452440	1455880	are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy, and trustworthy.
1455880	1457320	They're more likely to be hired.
1457320	1460760	So it's not just about Instagram likes, this is serious stuff.
1460760	1463400	And we, the woke, we're all aware of this.
1463400	1466760	We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.
1466760	1469080	We know that beauty standards come from the people
1469080	1471320	with privilege in an unequal society.
1471320	1474120	We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,
1474120	1476920	able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive
1476920	1479880	than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.
1479880	1481960	We know that female beauty matters so much
1481960	1483160	because it's patriarchy.
1483160	1484760	We know that our obsession with beauty
1484760	1486760	is being provoked by advertising,
1486760	1489080	the cosmetic industry, and beauty influencers
1489080	1490920	who are trying to sell us products.
1490920	1492680	We know, we know, we know all this
1492680	1494360	because we've all been sitting around
1494360	1496120	critiquing it for decades.
1496120	1497880	Because that's what leftists do.
1498440	1500040	We critique things.
1500040	1503160	We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,
1503160	1507000	ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism run AMAC.
1507000	1509800	We notice an injustice, we problematize it,
1509800	1512600	we critique it, and then we cancel it.
1512600	1513800	But what's next?
1513800	1515480	When we're done critiquing things,
1515480	1517320	what are we supposed to do?
1517320	1519960	Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards
1519960	1522840	are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic, transphobic
1522840	1525480	social construct designed to preserve power relations
1525480	1528200	and sell products, but does that awareness mean
1528200	1531080	I desire any less to be conventionally beautiful?
1531080	1532840	Well, no.
1532840	1534200	I want it more than ever.
1534200	1536600	The problem is that the intellectual exercise
1536600	1539320	of critiquing things doesn't usually affect
1539320	1541480	my desires very much.
1541480	1543080	So what am I supposed to do?
1543080	1544920	Sit here in silent contemplation
1544920	1546920	until my desires finally align themselves
1546920	1548360	with the interests of the international
1548360	1550040	proletarian revolution?
1550040	1551720	Oh, fuck the revolution.
1551720	1553320	I want to be a pretty rich girl.
1553320	1555000	I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.
1555000	1556600	I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.
1556600	1558760	Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea
1558760	1561320	I came up with when I was a male alcoholic.
1561320	1563880	Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now
1563880	1567160	more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,
1567160	1569000	so I guess I'm stuck with it.
1569000	1570440	Maybe it's for the best.
1570440	1573000	Critiquing society may not change our desires,
1573000	1575640	but it can motivate us to change society.
1575640	1578600	And changing society can change our desires.
1578600	1580600	So how do we change society?
1581320	1582440	Revolution.
1582440	1584040	Well, sure, revolution.
1584040	1585800	Depending on what happens in 2020,
1585800	1587800	I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.
1587800	1590120	But failing that, I think there are ways
1590120	1591720	we can work to loosen the grip
1591720	1593240	of restrictive beauty standards
1593240	1596360	without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.
1596360	1598360	I do think representation matters,
1598360	1600280	and I think having visible beauty icons
1600280	1602040	who are dark-skinned, or trans,
1602040	1604040	or gender non-conforming, or disabled,
1604040	1607080	or fat, or over 35, or influencers
1607080	1608360	makes a big difference.
1608360	1610280	Beauty standards are social constructs,
1610280	1612360	and social constructs can change.
1612360	1614440	That's why it's so important to recognize
1614440	1617960	that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.
1617960	1619720	But the problem with changing society
1619720	1621160	is that it takes a long time,
1621160	1622920	and this video is almost over.
1622920	1626280	Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral
1626280	1629800	is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.
1629800	1631800	You can be stylish at any age.
1631800	1634200	You can be stylish whether you pass or not.
1634200	1637160	Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic
1637160	1639080	that you have complete control over.
1639080	1642520	It's like art in that originality is a virtue.
1642600	1645000	Style is an individual aesthetic,
1645000	1648040	unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.
1648040	1651160	As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,
1651160	1653160	every author, as far as he is great
1653160	1655000	and at the same time original,
1655000	1657720	has had the task of creating the taste
1657720	1659640	by which he is to be enjoyed.
1659640	1662520	So even if you don't conform to conventional beauty standards,
1662520	1664840	through the power of original style,
1664840	1666680	you can create the taste
1666680	1669400	by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.
1669400	1672360	Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,
1672360	1675480	but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,
1675480	1678920	I can easily abide any comment, any stare.
1678920	1682280	I can be misgendered a dairy queen for all I care.
1682280	1683800	It does not matter.
1683800	1685400	I can strut with confidence
1685400	1688200	because I am basking in the regal knowledge
1688200	1690840	of my own aesthetic superiority.
1690840	1692760	Bow before me, peasants,
1692760	1695000	I proclaim to the drive-thru window,
1695000	1697640	for I am serving a lurk.
1698280	1700360	Sir, this is a dairy queen.
1701000	1703400	So, I guess that's the solution.
1703400	1706680	I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.
1706680	1707960	Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get
1707960	1710120	a lot of expensive plastic surgery?
1710120	1711000	Fuck no!
1711000	1712280	What do you people think I am,
1712280	1714680	some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?
1714680	1715720	Goddamn!
1715720	1717240	The audacity of you people.
1717240	1718360	The hubris!
1718360	1721160	Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.
1721160	1723000	In fact, after the month I've had,
1723000	1725240	you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.
1725240	1726760	So, that's it for me.
1726760	1729560	I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age
1729560	1730920	to look forward to.
1730920	1732760	I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth
1732760	1735560	in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.
1736280	1736780	Ew.
1737800	1738760	Gross.
1819560	1847880	I'm drooling all over myself
1847880	1849880	because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.
1851240	1851800	Love that.
