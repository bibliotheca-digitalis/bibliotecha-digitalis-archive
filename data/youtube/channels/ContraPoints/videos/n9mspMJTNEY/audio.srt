1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:17,240
My shop is the fake side front I'm real when I shop my face

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,320
Hey guys, it's Natalie.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,880
Welcome back to my channel.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,760
But first, story time, story time, story time.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,560
so much to me.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,940
Like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story.

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,940
My whole entire journey.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,440
This journey I've been on as a transgender woman.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,860
You've been with me on this whole journey.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,980
This is my truth.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,120
You've accepted the truth of my journey.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,680
This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,080
been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,380
The whole message of my journey as an influencer.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,340
The vulnerable moment of truth and the lived experience of my life and the truth of my

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,340
life.

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:33,420
I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,420
fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
Anyway let's talk about plastic surgery.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,260
I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,260
What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,660
that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,340
So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring,

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
a trachea shave.

29
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,060
You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,940
A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault whence the skin of the forehead was

31
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,340
stripped away from the bone.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:17,140
A fragment of the supraorbital ridge was then chiseled away, removed, reshaped, and reaffixed

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,500
thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that of times distinguisheth

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,900
the skull of the chad.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,820
A second incision was made athwart the columella of the nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,460
of the anterior cartilage and bone.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,860
Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped

38
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,100
and shaved down to a gracile curvature of jaw and pointed chin, thereby delineating

39
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,900
a facial silhouette exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,020
It all sounds pretty gruesome when you describe it like that, but there's actually a very

41
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,020
fine level of technique and aesthetics involved.

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,300
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,020
The results are natural, I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done, which is good,

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,420
you know, you at least want to leave people wondering, maybe she's born with it, maybe

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,780
a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull.

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Here's a before and after picture where you can clearly see the difference.

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,700
To use the exact medical terminology, my brow's on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,140
house, my jaw's snatched, and my Adam's apple is cancelled.

49
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,740
Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,860
Maybe Satan's apple?

51
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,940
I think I still look like myself, it's not a new face, we're talking about millimeters

52
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
of bone here.

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,580
But to have all that done was, well, it cost a lot of money, the anticipation was oh, terror

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,140
like I've never known, the pain was memorable, and the recovery took more than a month, in

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
fact I still have some swelling in my jowls.

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,180
Jowls, there's a nice feminine-sounding word, love that.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,260
The standard YouTube t-girl thing to do, of course, would've been to vlog the whole journey.

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,900
Story time, my facial surgery experience, my FFS journey, and post constant social media

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
updates about it.

60
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,580
And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that, because it was really helpful to

61
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,300
me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what I was getting myself into.

62
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,620
But I decided not to post about the surgery, because I wanted privacy for the recovery,

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,460
and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before subjecting

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,220
myself to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,660
You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people

66
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,140
say about my appearance online.

67
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,700
And I'm not even talking about the haters, like at this point I can mostly brush them off.

68
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,300
But for instance, about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit, and some

69
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,100
trans woman was agonizing about her appearance, and someone offered the encouragement,

70
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,820
You know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Just look at ContraPoints.

72
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Ugh.

73
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,140
Like a dagger to the heart.

74
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,180
The unintentional shade of it all.

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,980
So the past six weeks have been, at times, difficult and lonely, but I did manage to

76
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,340
keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be

77
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,500
for the commentary of the internet.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
So bring it on you jackals.

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You vultures.

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
You goblin swine.

81
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,620
While I was lying around bandaged and bored, I did have a lot of time to think.

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,780
And what I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,

83
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,620
which is, why would someone do what I just did?

84
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,340
Why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much anxiety and pain just to

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,380
change a few millimeters of bone?

86
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,860
Isn't this all just extravagant vanity?

87
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,540
Some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?

88
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,620
Well I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me to say that in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.

89
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,380
Usually trans people say that surgeries like facial feminization, top surgery, genital

90
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,940
reassignment, and so on serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria, this discomfort

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,780
we feel with the mismatch between our bodies and our gender identity.

92
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,620
So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically necessary reconstructive procedure

93
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,020
needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones match the 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio

94
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
girl I truly am inside, thereby alleviating my dysphoria, helping me safely blend into

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,460
society, and preventing a 5 alarm psychiatric meltdown.

96
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,100
And there is definitely truth to that, it's certainly the argument I intend to make when

97
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,860
I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,140
If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now and insert the next floppy disk

99
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,500
into your CD drive.

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,180
But hypothetically speaking, I think the reality might not be quite so simple.

101
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,660
How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the other kinds of body image dysphoria

102
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,500
that drive cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the time?

103
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,740
Last year, when I used a foolishly tweet-things-of-substance, I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS, and some

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,020
trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia and

105
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
self-loathing.

106
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,100
They compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery, or so-called ethnic

107
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,380
rhinoplasty, which they say are motivated by internalized racism and Western beauty

108
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
standards.

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,140
I think that's a pretty weak analogy, and telling a trans person to just learn to accept

110
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,060
the way they look can actually be kinda transphobic, because a big part of what it even means to

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,700
be trans, at least for me, is the desire to look more female.

112
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,980
But I also think trans people often talk like gender dysphoria is this intrinsic, personal

113
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,080
experience that's always 100% valid and never has anything at all to do with the external

114
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,860
pressure of beauty standards.

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,160
But in fact, gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of

116
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,700
societal ideals and norms.

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,820
Early in my transition, some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair, so I had full-body laser

118
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,380
hair removal, and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg.

119
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,260
But where does the idea that women don't have body hair come from?

120
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,700
Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?

121
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,140
A lot of the cis women I know don't so much as shave their legs, so maybe I'm not even

122
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,060
trying to look like a cis woman.

123
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,260
Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a

124
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,260
knuckly, hairy, BOOM, mannish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my

125
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
core.

126
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,220
Is this gender dysphoria, or is it internalized transphobia, or is it simply a cosmetic preference?

127
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,180
When I try to psychoanalyze myself, I find that my desires to look female, to look feminine,

128
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,300
and to look beautiful are not exactly the same, but they're woven together so tightly

129
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,500
that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,860
And the opposite is also true, that for me, feeling mannish or dysphoric usually goes

131
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,660
along with feeling ugly.

132
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,300
I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking, well, I'm giving femme

133
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,300
queen realness, but apart from that I look like absolute shit.

134
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,580
Of course there are qualities that make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive,

135
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,900
like cellulite or flabby arms, which are superfish but aren't deemed beautiful by society.

136
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,380
The truth is, I don't just want to look female, I want to be beautiful.

137
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Desperately.

138
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
God, I'll do anything.

139
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Anything.

140
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,620
In this video, I want to explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful, and why it

141
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,300
seems like a lot of people who live in a society are so obsessed.

142
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Is it phones?

143
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
It's probably phones.

144
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,060
I know you're supposed to pretend that you don't care about being beautiful or that you're

145
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,540
not trying, but guys, it's the only thing I care about and I've never tried so hard

146
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
at anything.

147
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,940
Of course, I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it, because there's this idea

148
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,060
that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.

149
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,260
You know, smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty, and I've always been categorized

150
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,740
as a smart person by people around me.

151
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,500
Some of that is when you're raised like I was, as a middle-class white boy with no athletic

152
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,820
talent, parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius, like Einstein nutted a load

153
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,180
in Mozart's bussy and Mozart shat you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from

154
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,420
Vincent van Gogh.

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,740
It inspired his famous painting, Starfish Night.

156
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,020
But even among women, caring about beauty is often frowned upon.

157
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,700
I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia, and I know a few because

158
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,020
I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a, uh, what do you call someone

159
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
who makes videos?

160
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,260
A cam girl.

161
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,220
Most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup.

162
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,140
To them, the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable.

163
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,340
Like maybe on Halloween.

164
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,580
Now part of that is that women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present

165
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,380
more masculine to be taken seriously, because of this prejudice that beautified femininity

166
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,780
equals frivolous.

167
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,260
But another part is clearly some kind of not-like-other-girls weird flex.

168
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,760
Which okay, fine, whatever, I'm not gonna judge another woman for the way she copes

169
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,960
with a society that pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling

170
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,280
them for caring about it.

171
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,920
I guess my way of coping is this tacky, heteronormative, and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,160
of post-ironic feminine beauty.

173
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Why am I like this?

174
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Well part of it is vindictive transsexualism, pure and simple.

175
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
To all the people who've ever called me a man, I wanna say, fuck you, by looking like

176
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,840
the undeniable visual archetype of a woman, which is a beautiful feminine woman.

177
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.

178
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
They're biological sequins.

179
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Uh.

180
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Ooh.

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,960
That is some ASMR right there, listen to that.

182
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Oh.

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,000
Another factor is this shitty website.

184
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm a professional YouTube influencer, forgive me father, and I'm on camera all the time.

185
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,160
I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month staring at my own face on

186
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
a screen.

187
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Now you try doing that and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.

188
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,400
Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.

189
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,080
A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young and so beautiful it makes me wanna throw up.

190
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,040
And in comparison, for a long time I've felt like this shabby, aging transvestite.

191
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,680
It's this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.

192
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,360
So I'm insecure, I'm compensating for that whole mess, but I honestly don't resent the

193
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,600
beautiful people, I really just stan the hell out of them.

194
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,680
I follow this woman on YouTube and I wanna be just like her mom.

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,200
Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.

196
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,840
Her name is Lady Jane McLean, Signora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials, Tatiana Petrovna Westbrokova,

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,160
and of course my queen and perfect goddess whomst I stan and whose portrait I've painted

198
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
hundreds of times.

199
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,920
So there's maybe some extra intensity for me, but I think it's actually pretty normal

200
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
to wanna be beautiful.

201
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,720
I think even grad students wanna be beautiful, they just wanna do it in that Becky kind of

202
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,560
way where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.

203
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,520
And it's not just women who care about beauty either.

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,680
I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery, but now even the straights

205
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
are doing it.

206
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,720
Incels are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal appearance, and the ones

207
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,920
who aren't completely blackpilled are obsessed with plastic surgery.

208
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,520
The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing, because of course they have to go about this

209
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,320
in the most heterosexual possible way.

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,640
It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen in order to maximize looks-money status and

211
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,120
secure access to females.

212
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,520
Oh my god, calm down.

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Not every sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.

214
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,800
Yes, they actually call skin care SKIN-MAXING.

215
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,240
James Charles, I know you're having a hard month, but I've got a business idea that's

216
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,880
gonna turn this thing around for you.

217
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Here's the plan.

218
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,680
You're gonna create a new line of skin care products called CHADGLOW, bribe PewDiePie

219
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,000
to send his fans to the promo video, hi sister cells, and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,200
If you read looks-max forums, they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants, chin implants,

221
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,520
mandible implants.

222
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:18,440
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.

223
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,400
It's literally facial masculinization surgery.

224
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,280
So everyone's obsessed with the bones, everyone's obsessed with beauty, whether man or woman,

225
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,200
cis or trans, gay or gamer.

226
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin' while everyone else has completely lost their minds.

227
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
But why?

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Why do we care so much?

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,760
Well with incels, by their own account, the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing

230
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,560
will make femoids have sex with them, and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful.

231
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,280
Which, um, it will not.

232
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,840
So incels are cancelled.

233
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Now what about women?

234
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
What's our deal?

235
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
What's our sitch?

236
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
What's our vibe?

237
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
What's our vige?

238
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,760
Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels, that we care about beauty

239
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,600
and wear makeup, fake up, because we're trying to attract men.

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,280
My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year and said that women wear makeup because they're

241
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,280
trying to stimulate male sexual arousal and because evolution.

242
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,600
Now at the risk of being bratty, I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.

243
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,200
For one thing, straight men don't like makeup, at least they don't think they do.

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,960
Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about

245
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
makeup.

246
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,040
Yes, I asked all of them.

247
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,680
If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.

248
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,480
And I actually do look diseased when I don't wear makeup, so fair enough.

249
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,960
If you wear natural makeup, you know, a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip, they

250
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,240
think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.

251
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,640
If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow, heavy contouring, overdrawn lips, they think

252
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,960
it's dumb and they hate it.

253
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,600
Of course I'm generalizing, hashtag not all daddy Doms.

254
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,720
But if women really wore makeup to attract men, then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing

255
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,040
it when there are no men around, but that doesn't happen.

256
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,000
About a month ago there was that video going around of a woman showing how to make jailhouse

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,680
makeup, mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow, using Kool-Aid and Vaseline

258
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
to make lipstick.

259
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,400
There's not a lot of men in women's prison, but women are still performing incredible

260
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,020
feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.

261
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,480
So maybe women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity, you know,

262
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,720
things that prison tries to take away from you.

263
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Kinda makes sense.

264
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,800
There's a Refinery29 documentary about prison cosmetology, and also sexual exploitation,

265
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,720
yikes, in which a former inmate describes how women would engage in sexual bartering

266
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
with male guards just to get makeup.

267
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,840
If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer, he would bring her in colored pencils,

268
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
lip gloss, things like that.

269
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,880
That's right, women are sucking dicks that they can put on makeup, not the other way

270
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
around.

271
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,360
If all the men died tomorrow, F, I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.

272
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
In fact, I might wear more.

273
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,400
And I'm not just saying that cos I'm trying to win feminist points or anything, like,

274
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
do I want to attract men?

275
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes, of course I do.

276
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Do I want to attract women?

277
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I guess.

278
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
I don't really think about it.

279
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,120
Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
Whatever, it's fine.

281
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,000
I want to attract non-binary people too, of course, but right now you guys are kind of

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,080
getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender, so how dare you.

283
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,720
The point is, when I think about my appearance, wanting to attract people to have sex with

284
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,960
is not the main thing going through my head.

285
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
What is going through my head?

286
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,340
🎵

287
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,440
I guess I just want to feel beautiful, I want to see myself in the mirror and think I look

288
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
snatched, is that a crime?

289
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,400
I don't feel pretty very often.

290
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
I'd say it happens about once a month.

291
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,000
When I'm having a good skin day, I do my makeup just right, I glisten with setting spray,

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and then it happens.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
A tingle goes up my spine.

294
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,440
I am Botticelli.

295
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,560
I am Van Gogh.

296
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,480
I have created beauty.

297
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,240
I'm a girl.

298
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
And then it's over.

299
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
That's it for a month.

300
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,200
Usually when I look in the mirror, I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.

301
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,920
Like with other people, I can just look at them and instantly make a judgment about it,

302
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,440
but with myself, I have to just guess.

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,400
It's the same as being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass.

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
Would you clock me?

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,200
I'd clock me.

306
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I'd fuck me too.

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I don't give a shit.

308
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600
Get out of my room, mom!

309
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,720
It doesn't work like that for me.

310
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,040
I have to rely on other people's feedback.

311
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,600
Of course, the problem with other people's feedback is that people are liars.

312
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,920
You look great, hon, especially when those people are your fans.

313
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,960
Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat, mother, I'll die for you!

314
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Oh my god.

315
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
Or when they're your haters.

316
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,360
Your disgusting, giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces.

317
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,160
I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.

318
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,440
But I can estimate, like, I have figured out that I'm too pretty for Twitter, but I'm

319
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,240
not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.

320
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
It's hard being a six.

321
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,040
I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.

322
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,680
Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup

323
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,400
looks, and what I find addictive about it is this constant flow of positive comments

324
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,560
from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.

325
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,640
You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy!

326
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,360
Every time I get a comment like that, I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration

327
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,520
fueled by parasocial delusions, but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically female

328
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
brain.

329
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,800
And the intoxicating thing about Instagram is that the embellishment of the truth is

330
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,880
a two-way street, thanks to the miracle of Facetune.

331
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,600
Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.

332
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,720
See, it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul.

333
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Get it?

334
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,280
Should I explain it again?

335
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
Phones live in a society.

336
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,160
Facetune is an app that lets you fix all the problems with your face.

337
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,920
So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.

338
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,960
What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion, shrink the nose a little,

339
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,440
bring the jaw in, and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.

340
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,080
It's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo-doctoring people have been doing

341
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,800
since the invention of photography.

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
What's changed is that now everyone is doing it to their own photos every day.

343
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,800
And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit of editing my flaws out of pictures,

344
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,560
when I look at an unedited picture of myself, or when I look in the mirror,

345
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,520
my eyes go straight to the flaws.

346
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,780
Why are my pores so big?

347
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,240
Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?

348
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,760
Is this really a good use of my mental energy?

349
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,360
Here comes that guilt again.

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,800
Instead of worrying about my pores, shouldn't I be helping stop the impending

351
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,560
climate catastrophe that's gonna destroy the planet if we don't change the economy

352
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
in like 12 years?

353
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.

354
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
It's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much else on my mind.

355
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,880
🎵

356
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,080
He's just so cute.

357
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,880
I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic than the apocalypse.

358
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,400
And that's the darkness.

359
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,960
Why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin?

360
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,640
Do I need Botox yet?

361
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Should I get a facelift?

362
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,680
These are the questions that will no doubt define the next couple decades of my life.

363
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,520
As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence on camera,

364
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,240
I also have to deal with aging, and thus the ritual of skincare products.

365
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,080
Here's my daytime routine.

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,000
So first I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,600
None of this is sponsored by the way, this is just me supporting corporations out of

368
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,240
the kindness of my heart.

369
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,360
Now if I'm not running late for something, I will do a face mask, but if I'm out of bed,

370
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,600
it's because I'm running late for something, so...

371
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,440
I've never done a face mask.

372
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,320
Now I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.

373
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Now a lot of people don't know what a toner does, but um...

374
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,920
Look it tones okay!

375
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Do you want your face to be untoned?

376
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,480
Next I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.

377
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,520
I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper than the Japanese yeast,

378
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,680
so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.

379
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,800
Think of the savings.

380
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,240
Now I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.

381
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,920
You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.

382
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,440
It's enchanting, it's like I'm there.

383
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,080
There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.

384
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,280
I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to, and I do everything Gigi says.

385
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
Every fucking thing.

386
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,320
I know it seems like a lot of products,

387
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,000
but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,

388
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,160
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

389
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,840
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

390
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,720
A sunscreen.

391
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,640
I'm not really sure what this does.

392
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,320
We can probably skip it.

393
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,840
And I'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive mist.

394
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,440
Yes god, I love a good facial.

395
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm so fucking wet right now.

396
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,240
So after all these products, does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?

397
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,520
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but it certainly is moist.

398
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,800
This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face for 10 minutes

399
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,480
and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time.

400
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm fine.

401
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,520
It's, it's fine.

402
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,240
This is fine.

403
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,840
It's fine.

404
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,960
Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas.

405
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,040
For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

406
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,680
Leastwise I shall bequeath a female skull.

407
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,440
So isn't beauty supposed to be fun?

408
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,840
I'm not having fun right now.

409
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
Why am I not having fun?

410
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm not having fun right now.

411
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,760
Why am I not having fun?

412
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,160
I guess I just don't feel beautiful.

413
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,

415
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,920
and I know I should be grateful,

416
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,960
and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,

417
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,080
and I know I shouldn't care so much about this in the first place.

418
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,840
But the truth is that this just eats away at me,

419
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,200
and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.

420
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
I've been kind of depressed this past month,

421
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,720
and I think part of it is that, on a subconscious level,

422
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,640
I think I was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image

423
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,320
and make me like myself.

424
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,000
But it really hasn't.

425
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,120
I mean, I'm happy with the results, I'd do it all again.

426
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,000
But I still feel the way I felt before.

427
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,160
You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific problems,

428
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,680
like the Adam's apple problem,

429
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,320
or the way my forehead looks and profile problem.

430
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,720
But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.

431
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,800
I still don't feel beautiful,

432
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,160
and I need to face the fact that I'm never going to feel beautiful

433
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,080
unless I change the way I think.

434
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,480
Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,

435
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,000
and if I'm ever gonna get out,

436
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,640
I think I need to start by forgiving myself

437
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,400
for wanting to be beautiful.

438
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,640
There's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful

439
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,800
besides being shallow and vain.

440
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
For one, beauty is associated with youth.

441
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,800
It's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.

442
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,200
That's a profound thing to be concerned about.

443
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,000
See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.

444
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,320
Beauty is also associated with moral worth,

445
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,960
the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.

446
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,440
There's studies showing that conventionally attractive people

447
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,880
are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy, and trustworthy.

448
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,320
They're more likely to be hired.

449
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,760
So it's not just about Instagram likes, this is serious stuff.

450
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,400
And we, the woke, we're all aware of this.

451
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,760
We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.

452
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,080
We know that beauty standards come from the people

453
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,320
with privilege in an unequal society.

454
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,120
We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,

455
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,920
able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive

456
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,880
than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.

457
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,960
We know that female beauty matters so much

458
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
because it's patriarchy.

459
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,760
We know that our obsession with beauty

460
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
is being provoked by advertising,

461
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,080
the cosmetic industry, and beauty influencers

462
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,920
who are trying to sell us products.

463
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
We know, we know, we know all this

464
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,360
because we've all been sitting around

465
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,120
critiquing it for decades.

466
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,880
Because that's what leftists do.

467
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,040
We critique things.

468
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,160
We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,

469
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,000
ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism run AMAC.

470
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,800
We notice an injustice, we problematize it,

471
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
we critique it, and then we cancel it.

472
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,800
But what's next?

473
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,480
When we're done critiquing things,

474
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,320
what are we supposed to do?

475
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,960
Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards

476
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,840
are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic, transphobic

477
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,480
social construct designed to preserve power relations

478
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,200
and sell products, but does that awareness mean

479
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,080
I desire any less to be conventionally beautiful?

480
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,840
Well, no.

481
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,200
I want it more than ever.

482
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
The problem is that the intellectual exercise

483
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,320
of critiquing things doesn't usually affect

484
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,480
my desires very much.

485
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,080
So what am I supposed to do?

486
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,920
Sit here in silent contemplation

487
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
until my desires finally align themselves

488
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,360
with the interests of the international

489
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,040
proletarian revolution?

490
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,720
Oh, fuck the revolution.

491
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,320
I want to be a pretty rich girl.

492
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,000
I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.

493
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.

494
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,760
Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea

495
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,320
I came up with when I was a male alcoholic.

496
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,880
Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now

497
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,160
more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,

498
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,000
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

499
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Maybe it's for the best.

500
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,000
Critiquing society may not change our desires,

501
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,640
but it can motivate us to change society.

502
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,600
And changing society can change our desires.

503
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
So how do we change society?

504
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,440
Revolution.

505
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Well, sure, revolution.

506
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,800
Depending on what happens in 2020,

507
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.

508
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,120
But failing that, I think there are ways

509
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,720
we can work to loosen the grip

510
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,240
of restrictive beauty standards

511
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,360
without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.

512
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
I do think representation matters,

513
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,280
and I think having visible beauty icons

514
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,040
who are dark-skinned, or trans,

515
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
or gender non-conforming, or disabled,

516
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,080
or fat, or over 35, or influencers

517
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,360
makes a big difference.

518
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,280
Beauty standards are social constructs,

519
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,360
and social constructs can change.

520
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,440
That's why it's so important to recognize

521
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,960
that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.

522
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,720
But the problem with changing society

523
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
is that it takes a long time,

524
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,920
and this video is almost over.

525
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,280
Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral

526
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,800
is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.

527
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
You can be stylish at any age.

528
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,200
You can be stylish whether you pass or not.

529
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,160
Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic

530
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,080
that you have complete control over.

531
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,520
It's like art in that originality is a virtue.

532
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Style is an individual aesthetic,

533
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,040
unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.

534
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,160
As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,

535
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
every author, as far as he is great

536
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,000
and at the same time original,

537
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,720
has had the task of creating the taste

538
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,640
by which he is to be enjoyed.

539
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,520
So even if you don't conform to conventional beauty standards,

540
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,840
through the power of original style,

541
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,680
you can create the taste

542
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,400
by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.

543
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,360
Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,

544
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,480
but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,

545
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,920
I can easily abide any comment, any stare.

546
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,280
I can be misgendered a dairy queen for all I care.

547
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,800
It does not matter.

548
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
I can strut with confidence

549
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,200
because I am basking in the regal knowledge

550
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,840
of my own aesthetic superiority.

551
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,760
Bow before me, peasants,

552
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,000
I proclaim to the drive-thru window,

553
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,640
for I am serving a lurk.

554
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,360
Sir, this is a dairy queen.

555
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
So, I guess that's the solution.

556
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,680
I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.

557
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,960
Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get

558
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,120
a lot of expensive plastic surgery?

559
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,000
Fuck no!

560
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,280
What do you people think I am,

561
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,680
some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?

562
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,720
Goddamn!

563
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,240
The audacity of you people.

564
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,360
The hubris!

565
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,160
Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.

566
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,000
In fact, after the month I've had,

567
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,240
you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.

568
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,760
So, that's it for me.

569
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,560
I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age

570
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
to look forward to.

571
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,760
I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth

572
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,560
in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.

573
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,780
Ew.

574
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,760
Gross.

575
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm drooling all over myself

576
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.

577
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,800
Love that.
