00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front

00:08.760 --> 00:17.240
My shop is the fake side front I'm real when I shop my face

00:30.000 --> 00:38.320
Hey guys, it's Natalie.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.880
Welcome back to my channel.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.560
Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.760
But first, story time, story time, story time.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.000
I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.200
I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean

00:53.200 --> 00:54.560
so much to me.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.940
Like you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story.

00:57.940 --> 00:58.940
My whole entire journey.

00:58.980 --> 01:01.440
This journey I've been on as a transgender woman.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.860
You've been with me on this whole journey.

01:02.860 --> 01:03.980
This is my truth.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.120
You've accepted the truth of my journey.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.680
This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've

01:08.680 --> 01:12.080
been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.380
The whole message of my journey as an influencer.

01:17.380 --> 01:23.340
The vulnerable moment of truth and the lived experience of my life and the truth of my

01:23.340 --> 01:24.340
life.

01:24.340 --> 01:33.420
I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of

01:33.420 --> 01:36.420
fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.100
Anyway let's talk about plastic surgery.

01:38.100 --> 01:42.260
I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.

01:42.260 --> 01:47.260
What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures

01:47.260 --> 01:50.660
that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.

01:50.660 --> 01:56.340
So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring,

01:56.340 --> 01:57.340
a trachea shave.

01:57.340 --> 02:00.060
You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.

02:00.060 --> 02:06.940
A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault whence the skin of the forehead was

02:06.940 --> 02:09.340
stripped away from the bone.

02:09.340 --> 02:17.140
A fragment of the supraorbital ridge was then chiseled away, removed, reshaped, and reaffixed

02:17.140 --> 02:24.500
thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that of times distinguisheth

02:24.500 --> 02:26.900
the skull of the chad.

02:26.900 --> 02:33.820
A second incision was made athwart the columella of the nasal septum facilitating the reconstruction

02:33.820 --> 02:37.460
of the anterior cartilage and bone.

02:37.460 --> 02:43.860
Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek through which the mandible was rasped

02:43.860 --> 02:51.100
and shaved down to a gracile curvature of jaw and pointed chin, thereby delineating

02:51.100 --> 02:56.900
a facial silhouette exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.020
It all sounds pretty gruesome when you describe it like that, but there's actually a very

03:00.020 --> 03:03.020
fine level of technique and aesthetics involved.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.300
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

03:05.300 --> 03:09.020
The results are natural, I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done, which is good,

03:09.020 --> 03:12.420
you know, you at least want to leave people wondering, maybe she's born with it, maybe

03:12.420 --> 03:14.780
a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull.

03:14.780 --> 03:17.780
Here's a before and after picture where you can clearly see the difference.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.700
To use the exact medical terminology, my brow's on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the

03:21.700 --> 03:25.140
house, my jaw's snatched, and my Adam's apple is cancelled.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.740
Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?

03:26.740 --> 03:27.860
Maybe Satan's apple?

03:27.860 --> 03:31.940
I think I still look like myself, it's not a new face, we're talking about millimeters

03:31.940 --> 03:32.940
of bone here.

03:32.940 --> 03:38.580
But to have all that done was, well, it cost a lot of money, the anticipation was oh, terror

03:38.740 --> 03:44.140
like I've never known, the pain was memorable, and the recovery took more than a month, in

03:44.140 --> 03:46.140
fact I still have some swelling in my jowls.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.180
Jowls, there's a nice feminine-sounding word, love that.

03:49.180 --> 03:53.260
The standard YouTube t-girl thing to do, of course, would've been to vlog the whole journey.

03:53.260 --> 03:57.900
Story time, my facial surgery experience, my FFS journey, and post constant social media

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
updates about it.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.580
And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that, because it was really helpful to

04:02.580 --> 04:07.300
me to be able to watch those vlogs in advance and know what I was getting myself into.

04:07.300 --> 04:11.620
But I decided not to post about the surgery, because I wanted privacy for the recovery,

04:11.620 --> 04:15.460
and to just take some time to get to feel at home with the results before subjecting

04:15.460 --> 04:18.220
myself to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.

04:18.220 --> 04:22.660
You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged by reading for years the things people

04:22.660 --> 04:24.140
say about my appearance online.

04:24.140 --> 04:28.700
And I'm not even talking about the haters, like at this point I can mostly brush them off.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.300
But for instance, about a year ago I was reading through a transgender subreddit, and some

04:32.300 --> 04:36.100
trans woman was agonizing about her appearance, and someone offered the encouragement,

04:36.420 --> 04:39.820
You know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.820
Just look at ContraPoints.

04:40.820 --> 04:41.820
Ugh.

04:41.820 --> 04:44.140
Like a dagger to the heart.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.180
The unintentional shade of it all.

04:46.180 --> 04:51.980
So the past six weeks have been, at times, difficult and lonely, but I did manage to

04:51.980 --> 04:56.340
keep my mug off social media for long enough that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be

04:56.340 --> 04:58.500
for the commentary of the internet.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
So bring it on you jackals.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.500
You vultures.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
You goblin swine.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.620
While I was lying around bandaged and bored, I did have a lot of time to think.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.780
And what I've been thinking about is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,

05:10.780 --> 05:14.620
which is, why would someone do what I just did?

05:14.620 --> 05:19.340
Why would I spend so much time and money and go through so much anxiety and pain just to

05:19.340 --> 05:21.380
change a few millimeters of bone?

05:21.380 --> 05:23.860
Isn't this all just extravagant vanity?

05:23.860 --> 05:26.540
Some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?

05:26.540 --> 05:31.620
Well I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me to say that in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.

05:31.740 --> 05:35.380
Usually trans people say that surgeries like facial feminization, top surgery, genital

05:35.380 --> 05:40.940
reassignment, and so on serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria, this discomfort

05:40.940 --> 05:44.780
we feel with the mismatch between our bodies and our gender identity.

05:44.780 --> 05:49.620
So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery was a medically necessary reconstructive procedure

05:49.620 --> 05:55.020
needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones match the 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio

05:55.020 --> 06:00.020
girl I truly am inside, thereby alleviating my dysphoria, helping me safely blend into

06:00.020 --> 06:03.460
society, and preventing a 5 alarm psychiatric meltdown.

06:03.460 --> 06:07.100
And there is definitely truth to that, it's certainly the argument I intend to make when

06:07.100 --> 06:09.860
I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.

06:09.860 --> 06:14.140
If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now and insert the next floppy disk

06:14.140 --> 06:15.500
into your CD drive.

06:15.500 --> 06:20.180
But hypothetically speaking, I think the reality might not be quite so simple.

06:20.180 --> 06:24.660
How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria from the other kinds of body image dysphoria

06:24.660 --> 06:28.500
that drive cisgender people to get cosmetic surgery all the time?

06:28.500 --> 06:33.740
Last year, when I used a foolishly tweet-things-of-substance, I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS, and some

06:33.740 --> 06:38.020
trans people responded telling me that I was suffering from internalized transphobia and

06:38.020 --> 06:39.020
self-loathing.

06:39.020 --> 06:43.100
They compared it to East Asian people getting double eyelid surgery, or so-called ethnic

06:43.100 --> 06:47.380
rhinoplasty, which they say are motivated by internalized racism and Western beauty

06:47.380 --> 06:48.380
standards.

06:48.380 --> 06:52.140
I think that's a pretty weak analogy, and telling a trans person to just learn to accept

06:52.140 --> 06:57.060
the way they look can actually be kinda transphobic, because a big part of what it even means to

06:57.060 --> 07:00.700
be trans, at least for me, is the desire to look more female.

07:00.700 --> 07:05.980
But I also think trans people often talk like gender dysphoria is this intrinsic, personal

07:05.980 --> 07:11.080
experience that's always 100% valid and never has anything at all to do with the external

07:11.080 --> 07:12.860
pressure of beauty standards.

07:12.860 --> 07:17.160
But in fact, gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of

07:17.160 --> 07:18.700
societal ideals and norms.

07:18.700 --> 07:23.820
Early in my transition, some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair, so I had full-body laser

07:23.820 --> 07:27.380
hair removal, and now I'm smoother than a cisgender boiled egg.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.260
But where does the idea that women don't have body hair come from?

07:30.260 --> 07:32.700
Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?

07:32.700 --> 07:37.140
A lot of the cis women I know don't so much as shave their legs, so maybe I'm not even

07:37.140 --> 07:39.060
trying to look like a cis woman.

07:39.060 --> 07:44.260
Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can to avoid looking like the caricature of a

07:44.260 --> 07:50.260
knuckly, hairy, BOOM, mannish trans woman with which society has terrorized me to my

07:50.260 --> 07:51.260
core.

07:51.260 --> 07:57.220
Is this gender dysphoria, or is it internalized transphobia, or is it simply a cosmetic preference?

07:57.220 --> 08:03.180
When I try to psychoanalyze myself, I find that my desires to look female, to look feminine,

08:03.180 --> 08:08.300
and to look beautiful are not exactly the same, but they're woven together so tightly

08:08.300 --> 08:10.500
that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.

08:10.500 --> 08:15.860
And the opposite is also true, that for me, feeling mannish or dysphoric usually goes

08:15.860 --> 08:17.660
along with feeling ugly.

08:17.660 --> 08:21.300
I don't have a lot of days where I walk out the house thinking, well, I'm giving femme

08:21.300 --> 08:24.300
queen realness, but apart from that I look like absolute shit.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.580
Of course there are qualities that make you look female that aren't necessarily attractive,

08:28.580 --> 08:33.900
like cellulite or flabby arms, which are superfish but aren't deemed beautiful by society.

08:33.900 --> 08:38.380
The truth is, I don't just want to look female, I want to be beautiful.

08:38.380 --> 08:39.380
Desperately.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.940
God, I'll do anything.

08:40.940 --> 08:41.940
Anything.

08:41.940 --> 08:46.620
In this video, I want to explore why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful, and why it

08:46.620 --> 08:50.300
seems like a lot of people who live in a society are so obsessed.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.300
Is it phones?

08:51.300 --> 08:52.300
It's probably phones.

08:52.300 --> 08:56.060
I know you're supposed to pretend that you don't care about being beautiful or that you're

08:56.060 --> 08:59.540
not trying, but guys, it's the only thing I care about and I've never tried so hard

08:59.540 --> 09:00.540
at anything.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.940
Of course, I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it, because there's this idea

09:03.940 --> 09:07.060
that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.

09:07.060 --> 09:11.260
You know, smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty, and I've always been categorized

09:11.260 --> 09:13.740
as a smart person by people around me.

09:13.740 --> 09:17.500
Some of that is when you're raised like I was, as a middle-class white boy with no athletic

09:17.500 --> 09:22.820
talent, parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius, like Einstein nutted a load

09:22.820 --> 09:27.180
in Mozart's bussy and Mozart shat you out while he was getting a rusty trombone from

09:27.180 --> 09:28.420
Vincent van Gogh.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.740
It inspired his famous painting, Starfish Night.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.020
But even among women, caring about beauty is often frowned upon.

09:34.020 --> 09:38.700
I feel like an alien species when I hang out with women in academia, and I know a few because

09:38.700 --> 09:43.020
I once got half a PhD before dropping out to become a, uh, what do you call someone

09:43.020 --> 09:44.020
who makes videos?

09:44.020 --> 09:45.260
A cam girl.

09:45.260 --> 09:48.220
Most female grad students and professors I know don't wear makeup.

09:48.220 --> 09:53.140
To them, the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.340
Like maybe on Halloween.

09:54.340 --> 09:58.580
Now part of that is that women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present

09:58.580 --> 10:03.380
more masculine to be taken seriously, because of this prejudice that beautified femininity

10:03.380 --> 10:04.780
equals frivolous.

10:04.780 --> 10:08.260
But another part is clearly some kind of not-like-other-girls weird flex.

10:08.260 --> 10:12.760
Which okay, fine, whatever, I'm not gonna judge another woman for the way she copes

10:12.760 --> 10:16.960
with a society that pressures women to be beautiful while simultaneously belittling

10:16.960 --> 10:18.280
them for caring about it.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.920
I guess my way of coping is this tacky, heteronormative, and tragically sincere aspiration to some kind

10:23.920 --> 10:26.160
of post-ironic feminine beauty.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.160
Why am I like this?

10:27.160 --> 10:30.640
Well part of it is vindictive transsexualism, pure and simple.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.640
To all the people who've ever called me a man, I wanna say, fuck you, by looking like

10:34.640 --> 10:39.840
the undeniable visual archetype of a woman, which is a beautiful feminine woman.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.720
Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.160
They're biological sequins.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
Uh.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
Ooh.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.960
That is some ASMR right there, listen to that.

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
Oh.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.000
Another factor is this shitty website.

11:05.040 --> 11:10.280
I'm a professional YouTube influencer, forgive me father, and I'm on camera all the time.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.160
I edit my own videos so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month staring at my own face on

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
a screen.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.160
Now you try doing that and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.400
Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.

11:22.400 --> 11:27.080
A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young and so beautiful it makes me wanna throw up.

11:27.080 --> 11:33.040
And in comparison, for a long time I've felt like this shabby, aging transvestite.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.680
It's this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.

11:36.680 --> 11:41.360
So I'm insecure, I'm compensating for that whole mess, but I honestly don't resent the

11:41.360 --> 11:44.600
beautiful people, I really just stan the hell out of them.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.680
I follow this woman on YouTube and I wanna be just like her mom.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.200
Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.

11:50.200 --> 11:56.840
Her name is Lady Jane McLean, Signora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials, Tatiana Petrovna Westbrokova,

11:56.840 --> 12:00.160
and of course my queen and perfect goddess whomst I stan and whose portrait I've painted

12:00.160 --> 12:01.160
hundreds of times.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.920
So there's maybe some extra intensity for me, but I think it's actually pretty normal

12:04.920 --> 12:05.920
to wanna be beautiful.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.720
I think even grad students wanna be beautiful, they just wanna do it in that Becky kind of

12:09.720 --> 12:12.560
way where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.520
And it's not just women who care about beauty either.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.680
I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery, but now even the straights

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
are doing it.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.720
Incels are completely obsessed with the defects of their personal appearance, and the ones

12:23.720 --> 12:26.920
who aren't completely blackpilled are obsessed with plastic surgery.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.520
The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing, because of course they have to go about this

12:31.520 --> 12:33.320
in the most heterosexual possible way.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.640
It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen in order to maximize looks-money status and

12:37.640 --> 12:39.120
secure access to females.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.520
Oh my god, calm down.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.360
Not every sentence out of your mouth has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.800
Yes, they actually call skin care SKIN-MAXING.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.240
James Charles, I know you're having a hard month, but I've got a business idea that's

12:51.240 --> 12:52.880
gonna turn this thing around for you.

12:52.880 --> 12:53.880
Here's the plan.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.680
You're gonna create a new line of skin care products called CHADGLOW, bribe PewDiePie

12:58.680 --> 13:04.000
to send his fans to the promo video, hi sister cells, and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.200
If you read looks-max forums, they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants, chin implants,

13:09.200 --> 13:10.520
mandible implants.

13:10.520 --> 13:18.440
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.400
It's literally facial masculinization surgery.

13:21.440 --> 13:26.280
So everyone's obsessed with the bones, everyone's obsessed with beauty, whether man or woman,

13:26.280 --> 13:29.200
cis or trans, gay or gamer.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.440
Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin' while everyone else has completely lost their minds.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.440
But why?

13:34.440 --> 13:36.000
Why do we care so much?

13:36.000 --> 13:40.760
Well with incels, by their own account, the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing

13:40.760 --> 13:45.560
will make femoids have sex with them, and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.280
Which, um, it will not.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.840
So incels are cancelled.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Now what about women?

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
What's our deal?

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
What's our sitch?

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
What's our vibe?

13:53.840 --> 13:54.840
What's our vige?

13:54.840 --> 13:57.760
Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels, that we care about beauty

13:57.760 --> 14:01.600
and wear makeup, fake up, because we're trying to attract men.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.280
My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year and said that women wear makeup because they're

14:05.280 --> 14:09.280
trying to stimulate male sexual arousal and because evolution.

14:09.280 --> 14:14.600
Now at the risk of being bratty, I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.200
For one thing, straight men don't like makeup, at least they don't think they do.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.960
Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man in the world thinks about

14:21.960 --> 14:22.960
makeup.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.040
Yes, I asked all of them.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.680
If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.480
And I actually do look diseased when I don't wear makeup, so fair enough.

14:29.480 --> 14:33.960
If you wear natural makeup, you know, a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip, they

14:33.960 --> 14:36.240
think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.

14:36.240 --> 14:40.640
If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow, heavy contouring, overdrawn lips, they think

14:40.640 --> 14:41.960
it's dumb and they hate it.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.600
Of course I'm generalizing, hashtag not all daddy Doms.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.720
But if women really wore makeup to attract men, then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing

14:49.720 --> 14:53.040
it when there are no men around, but that doesn't happen.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.000
About a month ago there was that video going around of a woman showing how to make jailhouse

14:57.000 --> 15:01.680
makeup, mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow, using Kool-Aid and Vaseline

15:01.680 --> 15:02.680
to make lipstick.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.400
There's not a lot of men in women's prison, but women are still performing incredible

15:06.400 --> 15:10.020
feats of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.

15:10.020 --> 15:15.480
So maybe women are using makeup to express their individuality and femininity, you know,

15:15.480 --> 15:17.720
things that prison tries to take away from you.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.720
Kinda makes sense.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.800
There's a Refinery29 documentary about prison cosmetology, and also sexual exploitation,

15:23.800 --> 15:27.720
yikes, in which a former inmate describes how women would engage in sexual bartering

15:27.720 --> 15:29.720
with male guards just to get makeup.

15:29.720 --> 15:35.840
If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer, he would bring her in colored pencils,

15:35.840 --> 15:37.440
lip gloss, things like that.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.880
That's right, women are sucking dicks that they can put on makeup, not the other way

15:41.880 --> 15:42.880
around.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.360
If all the men died tomorrow, F, I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.680
In fact, I might wear more.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.400
And I'm not just saying that cos I'm trying to win feminist points or anything, like,

15:51.400 --> 15:52.720
do I want to attract men?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.200
Yes, of course I do.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.200
Do I want to attract women?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.200
I guess.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
I don't really think about it.

15:58.200 --> 16:03.120
Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?

16:03.120 --> 16:05.040
Whatever, it's fine.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.000
I want to attract non-binary people too, of course, but right now you guys are kind of

16:09.000 --> 16:14.080
getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender, so how dare you.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.720
The point is, when I think about my appearance, wanting to attract people to have sex with

16:17.720 --> 16:19.960
is not the main thing going through my head.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.200
What is going through my head?

16:21.200 --> 16:27.340
🎵

16:27.340 --> 16:31.440
I guess I just want to feel beautiful, I want to see myself in the mirror and think I look

16:31.440 --> 16:32.920
snatched, is that a crime?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.400
I don't feel pretty very often.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.280
I'd say it happens about once a month.

16:36.440 --> 16:42.000
When I'm having a good skin day, I do my makeup just right, I glisten with setting spray,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
and then it happens.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.320
A tingle goes up my spine.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.440
I am Botticelli.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.560
I am Van Gogh.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.480
I have created beauty.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.240
I'm a girl.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.240
And then it's over.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.240
That's it for a month.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.200
Usually when I look in the mirror, I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.920
Like with other people, I can just look at them and instantly make a judgment about it,

17:03.920 --> 17:06.440
but with myself, I have to just guess.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.400
It's the same as being a trans person trying to figure out whether you pass.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.240
Would you clock me?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.200
I'd clock me.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
I'd fuck me too.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.200
I don't give a shit.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.600
Get out of my room, mom!

17:18.600 --> 17:19.720
It doesn't work like that for me.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.040
I have to rely on other people's feedback.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.600
Of course, the problem with other people's feedback is that people are liars.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.920
You look great, hon, especially when those people are your fans.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.960
Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat, mother, I'll die for you!

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
Oh my god.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.400
Or when they're your haters.

17:36.400 --> 17:41.360
Your disgusting, giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.160
I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.

17:43.160 --> 17:48.440
But I can estimate, like, I have figured out that I'm too pretty for Twitter, but I'm

17:48.440 --> 17:51.240
not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.480
It's hard being a six.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.040
I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.680
Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm of posting my shitty little makeup

17:58.720 --> 18:03.400
looks, and what I find addictive about it is this constant flow of positive comments

18:03.400 --> 18:06.560
from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.640
You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy!

18:09.640 --> 18:13.360
Every time I get a comment like that, I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration

18:13.360 --> 18:18.520
fueled by parasocial delusions, but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically female

18:18.520 --> 18:19.520
brain.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.800
And the intoxicating thing about Instagram is that the embellishment of the truth is

18:22.800 --> 18:25.880
a two-way street, thanks to the miracle of Facetune.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.600
Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.720
See, it's a black mirror because it's a window into the darkness of the human soul.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Get it?

18:33.720 --> 18:35.280
Should I explain it again?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.880
Phones live in a society.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.160
Facetune is an app that lets you fix all the problems with your face.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.920
So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.

18:42.920 --> 18:46.960
What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion, shrink the nose a little,

18:46.960 --> 18:50.440
bring the jaw in, and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.080
It's really no more drastic than the kinds of photo-doctoring people have been doing

18:54.080 --> 18:55.800
since the invention of photography.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.640
What's changed is that now everyone is doing it to their own photos every day.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.800
And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit of editing my flaws out of pictures,

19:04.800 --> 19:08.560
when I look at an unedited picture of myself, or when I look in the mirror,

19:08.560 --> 19:11.520
my eyes go straight to the flaws.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.780
Why are my pores so big?

19:13.780 --> 19:17.240
Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.760
Is this really a good use of my mental energy?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.360
Here comes that guilt again.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.800
Instead of worrying about my pores, shouldn't I be helping stop the impending

19:24.800 --> 19:28.560
climate catastrophe that's gonna destroy the planet if we don't change the economy

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
in like 12 years?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.440
Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.880
It's just hard to focus on climate change when there's so much else on my mind.

19:34.880 --> 19:40.880
🎵

19:40.880 --> 19:42.080
He's just so cute.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.880
I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic than the apocalypse.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.400
And that's the darkness.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.960
Why is my neck like two decades older than the rest of my skin?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.640
Do I need Botox yet?

19:53.640 --> 19:54.640
Should I get a facelift?

19:54.640 --> 19:58.680
These are the questions that will no doubt define the next couple decades of my life.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.520
As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go through a second adolescence on camera,

20:02.520 --> 20:07.240
I also have to deal with aging, and thus the ritual of skincare products.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.080
Here's my daytime routine.

20:09.080 --> 20:15.000
So first I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.600
None of this is sponsored by the way, this is just me supporting corporations out of

20:18.600 --> 20:21.240
the kindness of my heart.

20:21.240 --> 20:26.360
Now if I'm not running late for something, I will do a face mask, but if I'm out of bed,

20:26.360 --> 20:30.600
it's because I'm running late for something, so...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.440
I've never done a face mask.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.320
Now I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.

20:35.320 --> 20:41.320
Now a lot of people don't know what a toner does, but um...

20:41.320 --> 20:42.920
Look it tones okay!

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
Do you want your face to be untoned?

20:44.920 --> 20:49.480
Next I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.520
I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper than the Japanese yeast,

20:52.520 --> 20:54.680
so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.800
Think of the savings.

20:55.800 --> 21:01.240
Now I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.920
You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.440
It's enchanting, it's like I'm there.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.080
There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.

21:09.080 --> 21:14.280
I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to, and I do everything Gigi says.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.720
Every fucking thing.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.320
I know it seems like a lot of products,

21:17.320 --> 21:21.000
but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.160
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.840
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.720
A sunscreen.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.640
I'm not really sure what this does.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.320
We can probably skip it.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.840
And I'm just gonna finish it all off with some more expensive mist.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.440
Yes god, I love a good facial.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.760
I'm so fucking wet right now.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.240
So after all these products, does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?

21:43.800 --> 21:48.520
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but it certainly is moist.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.800
This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face for 10 minutes

21:51.800 --> 21:55.480
and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time.

22:05.480 --> 22:06.280
I'm fine.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.520
It's, it's fine.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.240
This is fine.

22:10.280 --> 22:10.840
It's fine.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.960
Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas.

22:15.960 --> 22:20.040
For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.680
Leastwise I shall bequeath a female skull.

22:27.320 --> 22:32.440
So isn't beauty supposed to be fun?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.840
I'm not having fun right now.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.440
Why am I not having fun?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
I'm not having fun right now.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.760
Why am I not having fun?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.160
I guess I just don't feel beautiful.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.000
And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.400
and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,

22:47.400 --> 22:48.920
and I know I should be grateful,

22:48.920 --> 22:51.960
and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,

22:51.960 --> 22:55.080
and I know I shouldn't care so much about this in the first place.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.840
But the truth is that this just eats away at me,

22:58.840 --> 23:02.200
and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.600
I've been kind of depressed this past month,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.720
and I think part of it is that, on a subconscious level,

23:07.720 --> 23:11.640
I think I was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image

23:11.640 --> 23:13.320
and make me like myself.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.000
But it really hasn't.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.120
I mean, I'm happy with the results, I'd do it all again.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.000
But I still feel the way I felt before.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.160
You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes very specific problems,

23:25.160 --> 23:26.680
like the Adam's apple problem,

23:26.680 --> 23:29.320
or the way my forehead looks and profile problem.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.720
But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.800
I still don't feel beautiful,

23:35.800 --> 23:39.160
and I need to face the fact that I'm never going to feel beautiful

23:39.160 --> 23:41.080
unless I change the way I think.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.480
Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,

23:43.480 --> 23:45.000
and if I'm ever gonna get out,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.640
I think I need to start by forgiving myself

23:47.640 --> 23:49.400
for wanting to be beautiful.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.640
There's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful

23:51.640 --> 23:53.800
besides being shallow and vain.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.600
For one, beauty is associated with youth.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.800
It's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.200
That's a profound thing to be concerned about.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.000
See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.320
Beauty is also associated with moral worth,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.960
the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.440
There's studies showing that conventionally attractive people

24:12.440 --> 24:15.880
are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy, and trustworthy.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.320
They're more likely to be hired.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.760
So it's not just about Instagram likes, this is serious stuff.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.400
And we, the woke, we're all aware of this.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.760
We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.080
We know that beauty standards come from the people

24:29.080 --> 24:31.320
with privilege in an unequal society.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.120
We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,

24:34.120 --> 24:36.920
able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive

24:36.920 --> 24:39.880
than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.960
We know that female beauty matters so much

24:41.960 --> 24:43.160
because it's patriarchy.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.760
We know that our obsession with beauty

24:44.760 --> 24:46.760
is being provoked by advertising,

24:46.760 --> 24:49.080
the cosmetic industry, and beauty influencers

24:49.080 --> 24:50.920
who are trying to sell us products.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.680
We know, we know, we know all this

24:52.680 --> 24:54.360
because we've all been sitting around

24:54.360 --> 24:56.120
critiquing it for decades.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.880
Because that's what leftists do.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.040
We critique things.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.160
We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,

25:03.160 --> 25:07.000
ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism run AMAC.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.800
We notice an injustice, we problematize it,

25:09.800 --> 25:12.600
we critique it, and then we cancel it.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.800
But what's next?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.480
When we're done critiquing things,

25:15.480 --> 25:17.320
what are we supposed to do?

25:17.320 --> 25:19.960
Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards

25:19.960 --> 25:22.840
are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic, transphobic

25:22.840 --> 25:25.480
social construct designed to preserve power relations

25:25.480 --> 25:28.200
and sell products, but does that awareness mean

25:28.200 --> 25:31.080
I desire any less to be conventionally beautiful?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.840
Well, no.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.200
I want it more than ever.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.600
The problem is that the intellectual exercise

25:36.600 --> 25:39.320
of critiquing things doesn't usually affect

25:39.320 --> 25:41.480
my desires very much.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.080
So what am I supposed to do?

25:43.080 --> 25:44.920
Sit here in silent contemplation

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
until my desires finally align themselves

25:46.920 --> 25:48.360
with the interests of the international

25:48.360 --> 25:50.040
proletarian revolution?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.720
Oh, fuck the revolution.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.320
I want to be a pretty rich girl.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.000
I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.600
I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.760
Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea

25:58.760 --> 26:01.320
I came up with when I was a male alcoholic.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.880
Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now

26:03.880 --> 26:07.160
more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,

26:07.160 --> 26:09.000
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.440
Maybe it's for the best.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.000
Critiquing society may not change our desires,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.640
but it can motivate us to change society.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.600
And changing society can change our desires.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
So how do we change society?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.440
Revolution.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.040
Well, sure, revolution.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.800
Depending on what happens in 2020,

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.120
But failing that, I think there are ways

26:30.120 --> 26:31.720
we can work to loosen the grip

26:31.720 --> 26:33.240
of restrictive beauty standards

26:33.240 --> 26:36.360
without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.360
I do think representation matters,

26:38.360 --> 26:40.280
and I think having visible beauty icons

26:40.280 --> 26:42.040
who are dark-skinned, or trans,

26:42.040 --> 26:44.040
or gender non-conforming, or disabled,

26:44.040 --> 26:47.080
or fat, or over 35, or influencers

26:47.080 --> 26:48.360
makes a big difference.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.280
Beauty standards are social constructs,

26:50.280 --> 26:52.360
and social constructs can change.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.440
That's why it's so important to recognize

26:54.440 --> 26:57.960
that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.720
But the problem with changing society

26:59.720 --> 27:01.160
is that it takes a long time,

27:01.160 --> 27:02.920
and this video is almost over.

27:02.920 --> 27:06.280
Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral

27:06.280 --> 27:09.800
is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.800
You can be stylish at any age.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.200
You can be stylish whether you pass or not.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.160
Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic

27:17.160 --> 27:19.080
that you have complete control over.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.520
It's like art in that originality is a virtue.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.000
Style is an individual aesthetic,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.040
unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.160
As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
every author, as far as he is great

27:33.160 --> 27:35.000
and at the same time original,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.720
has had the task of creating the taste

27:37.720 --> 27:39.640
by which he is to be enjoyed.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.520
So even if you don't conform to conventional beauty standards,

27:42.520 --> 27:44.840
through the power of original style,

27:44.840 --> 27:46.680
you can create the taste

27:46.680 --> 27:49.400
by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.360
Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,

27:52.360 --> 27:55.480
but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,

27:55.480 --> 27:58.920
I can easily abide any comment, any stare.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.280
I can be misgendered a dairy queen for all I care.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.800
It does not matter.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.400
I can strut with confidence

28:05.400 --> 28:08.200
because I am basking in the regal knowledge

28:08.200 --> 28:10.840
of my own aesthetic superiority.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.760
Bow before me, peasants,

28:12.760 --> 28:15.000
I proclaim to the drive-thru window,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.640
for I am serving a lurk.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.360
Sir, this is a dairy queen.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.400
So, I guess that's the solution.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.680
I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.960
Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get

28:27.960 --> 28:30.120
a lot of expensive plastic surgery?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.000
Fuck no!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.280
What do you people think I am,

28:32.280 --> 28:34.680
some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?

28:34.680 --> 28:35.720
Goddamn!

28:35.720 --> 28:37.240
The audacity of you people.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.360
The hubris!

28:38.360 --> 28:41.160
Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.000
In fact, after the month I've had,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.240
you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.760
So, that's it for me.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.560
I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age

28:49.560 --> 28:50.920
to look forward to.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.760
I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth

28:52.760 --> 28:55.560
in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.

28:56.280 --> 28:56.780
Ew.

28:57.800 --> 28:58.760
Gross.

30:19.560 --> 30:47.880
I'm drooling all over myself

30:47.880 --> 30:49.880
because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.

30:51.240 --> 30:51.800
Love that.
