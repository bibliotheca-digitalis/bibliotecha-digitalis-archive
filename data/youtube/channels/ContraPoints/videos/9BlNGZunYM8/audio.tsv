0	24000	Hello boys! I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not
24000	28320	sure what that means. I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need
28320	33920	is a glorious knight of wisdom to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man. Some
33920	40820	call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant paladin
40820	45600	of the Fourth Reich. But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the Golden
45600	46600	One.
46600	64680	Oh my god. Look at his butt. Oh my god. Daddy, can I have some meat? Looks like meat's back
64680	70640	on the menu, boys! Oh daddy. You know Lars, things have really changed since the last
70640	75280	time we talked. I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since
75280	80040	I started my transition, so in a sense, I'm a virgin. And I don't know about the rest
80040	85200	of these decadent sluts, but I for one care about a little thing called purity. So, now
85200	89840	that my decade of gender dysphoric alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming to a close,
89840	94660	I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master. But first, let us fend off degeneracy
94660	100640	by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water and pure absinthe. It's time.
100640	111640	Down, down, I always wanna die on my own. I never really cared until I met you.
130640	138400	What? Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation? It is, isn't it? Well, mmm, they're shiny
138400	142720	and I want them. It's not my fault black people have good ideas. What am I supposed to do?
142720	149560	Not steal them? I'll pop it out. Alright, thou resplendent champion of the north, hit
149560	157680	me with your finest wisdom. I'm gonna go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.
157680	163480	There's always a nice thing to do. Well, at least we agree on something.
163480	170880	Aha! Autogynephilic narcissistic spose! Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms
170880	175360	like your whole thing? Misogynistic mental illness confirmed!
175360	181680	Abigail, what is your damage? Are you okay? How's your mom doing? Is everything alright?
188680	204960	You wanna get in the tub? Ow. So you're a lost baby girl and you're a game sweet prince.
204960	211080	He has an Instagram and it is delectable. Meets back on the menu, boys. He carries the
211080	223200	Charles Atlas Seal of Approval. What ho, you jaunty lads. My captain, my king. Yaaas.
223200	229480	If the golden one didn't exist I would have to invent him. I need him. And maybe you need
229480	235160	me too, Lars. I'm the moon to your sun, the Brune Hilda to your Siegfried. As you become
235160	239880	more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky fem. But you know, I'm noticing that even
239880	244280	though you're straight, you don't seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your
244280	250040	life. And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like
250040	255840	me. I'm not like the other girls. I've got the t's and the d. On second thought, leave
255840	261000	trans women alone. I don't want that blood on my hands. Well, this is no longer a relaxing
261000	268040	bath, and that's why we never bathe with fascists.
291000	299880	Well, I've locked my t, I've popped my e, let's talk about degeneracy. What are people
299880	304280	talking about when they call someone or something degenerate? Well, let's take a look at some
304280	309280	examples from my YouTube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context.
309280	313560	Transgender communist degenerate. Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak. Degen
313560	317960	tranny lal. Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens, or at
317960	321280	least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses. Lol what's
321280	326800	up with that? This is degeneracy. You oughta be slung from a tree. Everybody likes to rhyme.
326800	331160	You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.
331160	332160	The end.
332160	336480	Aw, these people are trying so hard to upset me. They've only got one card in the deck
336480	337480	though, alas.
337480	342760	Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,
342760	347280	like a burly nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired
347280	348920	with a loathing of queerness.
348920	353120	Now it's not always just about queerness. In fact, fascists and social conservatives
353120	358880	use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists,
358880	363560	communists, people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.
363560	367680	But where does the word degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn
367680	368680	more.
368680	376560	The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix de-, which means away from, and the Latin
376560	381840	word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be degenerate is to no longer be of your
381840	386000	race or kind, and if you think this already sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying
386000	387000	attention.
387000	391920	The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian
391920	396520	proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing
396520	401840	colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,
401840	406200	the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.
406200	410280	Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?
410280	415280	The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artour
415280	420440	de Gabineau, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabineau wrote a book called Essay
420440	424840	on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the Aryan master
424840	429320	race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word degenerate
429320	431200	its modern fashy definition.
431520	432520	M'lord.
432520	438680	The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same
438680	444840	intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,
444840	451320	continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man
451320	457480	of a decadent time, the degenerate man, properly so-called, is a different being from the racial
457480	463120	point of view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that
463120	470560	the human race and all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.
470560	475720	Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept
475720	481960	closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies
481960	486880	a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence
486880	491160	were everywhere in the European cultural imagination. During this period, German nationalist
491160	495960	composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning Jewishness in music, which he first published
495960	500760	under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally means free thought. That's right, he pulled
500760	502400	the goddamn free speech card.

516920	519600	In the 18th century, queer, absence-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the
519600	524160	title of their movement. Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was
524160	525920	4chan writ large.
525920	530520	So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then.
530520	535520	Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive
535520	540120	goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to
540120	544840	speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was
544840	550020	that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch
550020	552120	Visigoths and vandals.
552120	553680	Is there any truth to that?
553680	558600	No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors
558600	563720	Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries. The empire didn't
563720	567440	collapse till the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least 200 years between the
567440	571120	decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian.
571120	574920	And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand
574920	575920	years.
575920	581000	Well, hail Caligula. But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient
581000	586120	civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the
586120	588520	transgenders destroy civilizations.
588520	596920	The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting
596920	597920	to unravel.
598720	601720	Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.
601720	607720	Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.
607720	613720	You can see it happening all of a sudden. There's a kind of, you know, the sculptures
613720	619720	of handsome, nude young men athletes that used to be very robust in the archaic period
619720	625720	suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles toward the end. People who live in such times feel
626520	631520	that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan. Homosexuality, heterosexuality,
631520	637520	so what, anything goes and so on. But from the perspective of historical distance, you
637520	643520	can see that it's a culture that no longer believes in itself. And then what you invariably
643520	651520	get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity on the edges, whether
652320	657320	they're the vandals, the Huns, or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS. You see them
657320	662320	starting to mass on the outsides of the culture, and that's what we have right now. There's
662320	669320	a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the transgender
669320	677320	movement in our own culture and what's going on out there. I'm concerned, I feel it's
678120	686120	ominous. I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.
688120	693120	Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?
698120	703120	So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed
703920	708920	by real men. You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on. Where
708920	711920	does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?
711920	714920	Oh god, do we really have to do this?
714920	720920	So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich, who's every edgy 19-year-old's
720920	721920	favorite philosopher.
721920	728920	Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets, Dionysian in the streets.
729720	731720	Shh, go to sleep.
731720	735720	Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,
735720	740720	is decadent, in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society, we have all these hang-ups
740720	744720	about guilt and sin and the afterlife. And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with
744720	748720	people who are weak and sick, and that they repress our basic biological instincts to
748720	751720	value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.
751720	755720	In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.
756520	760520	There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea
760520	764520	of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.
764520	768520	And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about,
768520	773520	like, fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay,
773520	777520	I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.
778320	782320	What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism
782320	786320	was really kicking into gear, European society was already primed with a couple centuries
786320	790320	of degeneracy discourse. Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and
790320	796320	Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism, namely 1. The German
796320	802320	people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay. 2. The
803120	807120	Jews, Poles, Roma, Homosexuals, Communists, and the Disabled are degenerate elements that
807120	811120	contribute to decay. And 3. The degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure
811120	813120	the health and existence of the organism.
813120	817120	So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.
817120	821120	Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc. One particular thing I've noticed about modern
821120	825120	fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white,
825120	829120	black, and brown. And that's not to say that they don't have a history.
829920	835920	Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like
835920	839920	rats. And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,
839920	845920	including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta
845920	851920	male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married, not having kids, having kids
851920	855920	that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using
856720	858720	birth control, having abortions.
860720	868720	Condoms and dorjies and mass immigration, malt liquor forties and miscegenation,
868720	876720	boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.
876720	880720	Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?
880720	884720	Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.
885920	890720	There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be
890720	892720	responsible and I hate it.
892720	897920	So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about
897920	903520	driving, okay? Drink lots of water, and pace yourself. There's plenty of time to be blackout
903520	906720	when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.
906720	911520	Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you
912320	917120	situations with really horrible people, so I would never recommend that anyone get involved
917120	919120	with alcohol for any reason.
921120	924320	I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.
924320	926320	Where were we?
928320	935120	Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms,
935120	942720	antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things!
950720	952720	Hi there.
952720	954720	I hope you're having
954720	956720	a soothing
956720	958720	degenerate bath.
960720	962720	What I want you to do is just
962720	964720	lie back and
965520	967520	try to relax.
967520	969520	And I am
969520	971520	just going to
971520	973520	slowly start to drip
973520	975520	hot candle wax
985520	990720	So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white
990720	995280	procreation is degenerate, and individual fascists differ on what those things are.
995280	999280	Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people
999280	1004480	can't raise children. Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one
1004480	1008640	subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning
1008640	1012960	out clean-cut heterosexual white kids. And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get
1012960	1018000	basic social conservatism. So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk
1018000	1022960	about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles. Speaking of which, a lot of rightists
1022960	1027920	have realized that in the 21st century, the social conservative position is not very cool. So what
1027920	1032960	they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a
1032960	1038560	problem with is the gay agenda. What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness. Now, what
1038560	1043120	is queerness? Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most
1043120	1048000	generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing, so either your gender is all
1048000	1052880	fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners. But unlike the words homosexual or
1052880	1058000	transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion, often rebellion against the
1058000	1062640	heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.
1062640	1067120	So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and
1067120	1072320	transgender people, but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act
1072320	1077440	as normal as possible. What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness, because think of
1077440	1083760	the children. We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters,
1083760	1091520	polyamorists, sing it with me, these are my favorite degenerate things. To fascists, the pursuit of
1091520	1096560	individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race. So in a sense,
1096560	1101200	traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism, which only
1101200	1105760	demands the communal ownership of the means of production. At least in theory, communism doesn't
1105760	1110880	tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck. In practice though, there's not a single position
1110880	1114800	on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy. While I was
1114800	1119280	researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper
1119280	1121360	from 1976 that claims,
1121360	1125680	While we communists oppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,
1125760	1131280	we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right. Homosexuality is a form of social sickness,
1131280	1137360	a form of social perversion. It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to
1137360	1142880	the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom. Homosexuality arose from class
1142880	1145040	oppression and the oppression of women.
1145040	1149920	Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh? We've got the fascists
1149920	1154800	calling us sexual bolshevists, and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.
1154800	1159600	Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?
1189600	1194160	I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and pro-creative.
1194160	1198080	And you know, that's probably for the best. Someone needs to have the babies and keep
1198080	1203040	society running. All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights
1203040	1207680	and peace. My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind. In the
1207680	1211280	perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you
1211280	1215520	worry about that. And that's the difference between me and the fascists. I want a society
1215520	1219680	where people like me are simply allowed to exist. And, this is the important part, where
1219680	1224560	people not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people
1224560	1229120	like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is
1229120	1233280	to be the only survivor. So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence
1233280	1237120	of priests, which is to say bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a
1237120	1241920	giant tax-exempt drain on the economy, well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who
1241920	1246480	crack nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs. So if you think the meaning
1246480	1250800	of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine. Go make
1250800	1255280	white babies. But I really must insist, upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,
1255280	1260320	to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race-mixing, sexual anarchy,
1260320	1261120	and rock and roll.
1263600	1264320	Rock and roll.
1266560	1274400	A rock-on, gold-dust woman, take your silver spoon, take your grain.
1280880	1288720	I wake up in the morning, see your sunrise loves to go down.
1291280	1305520	Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud, cry out.
1308400	1315120	Well, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love? Well,
1315120	1321360	tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?
1327760	1335280	Rock on, ancient queen, follow those who fail and you're shut down.
1335280	1348480	Ah, that was jack it up. Rulers make bad lovers, you better put your king and dumb up for sale.
1351440	1360160	One more time. Oh, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love?
1360160	1373360	Well, tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?
1375040	1387360	Rock and roll.
