Hello boys! I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not

00:24.000 --> 00:28.320
sure what that means. I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need

00:28.320 --> 00:33.920
is a glorious knight of wisdom to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man. Some

00:33.920 --> 00:40.820
call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant paladin

00:40.820 --> 00:45.600
of the Fourth Reich. But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the Golden

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
One.

00:46.600 --> 01:04.680
Oh my god. Look at his butt. Oh my god. Daddy, can I have some meat? Looks like meat's back

01:04.680 --> 01:10.640
on the menu, boys! Oh daddy. You know Lars, things have really changed since the last

01:10.640 --> 01:15.280
time we talked. I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since

01:15.280 --> 01:20.040
I started my transition, so in a sense, I'm a virgin. And I don't know about the rest

01:20.040 --> 01:25.200
of these decadent sluts, but I for one care about a little thing called purity. So, now

01:25.200 --> 01:29.840
that my decade of gender dysphoric alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming to a close,

01:29.840 --> 01:34.660
I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master. But first, let us fend off degeneracy

01:34.660 --> 01:40.640
by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water and pure absinthe. It's time.

01:40.640 --> 01:51.640
Down, down, I always wanna die on my own. I never really cared until I met you.

02:10.640 --> 02:18.400
What? Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation? It is, isn't it? Well, mmm, they're shiny

02:18.400 --> 02:22.720
and I want them. It's not my fault black people have good ideas. What am I supposed to do?

02:22.720 --> 02:29.560
Not steal them? I'll pop it out. Alright, thou resplendent champion of the north, hit

02:29.560 --> 02:37.680
me with your finest wisdom. I'm gonna go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.480
There's always a nice thing to do. Well, at least we agree on something.

02:43.480 --> 02:50.880
Aha! Autogynephilic narcissistic spose! Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms

02:50.880 --> 02:55.360
like your whole thing? Misogynistic mental illness confirmed!

02:55.360 --> 03:01.680
Abigail, what is your damage? Are you okay? How's your mom doing? Is everything alright?

03:08.680 --> 03:24.960
You wanna get in the tub? Ow. So you're a lost baby girl and you're a game sweet prince.

03:24.960 --> 03:31.080
He has an Instagram and it is delectable. Meets back on the menu, boys. He carries the

03:31.080 --> 03:43.200
Charles Atlas Seal of Approval. What ho, you jaunty lads. My captain, my king. Yaaas.

03:43.200 --> 03:49.480
If the golden one didn't exist I would have to invent him. I need him. And maybe you need

03:49.480 --> 03:55.160
me too, Lars. I'm the moon to your sun, the Brune Hilda to your Siegfried. As you become

03:55.160 --> 03:59.880
more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky fem. But you know, I'm noticing that even

03:59.880 --> 04:04.280
though you're straight, you don't seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your

04:04.280 --> 04:10.040
life. And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like

04:10.040 --> 04:15.840
me. I'm not like the other girls. I've got the t's and the d. On second thought, leave

04:15.840 --> 04:21.000
trans women alone. I don't want that blood on my hands. Well, this is no longer a relaxing

04:21.000 --> 04:28.040
bath, and that's why we never bathe with fascists.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.880
Well, I've locked my t, I've popped my e, let's talk about degeneracy. What are people

04:59.880 --> 05:04.280
talking about when they call someone or something degenerate? Well, let's take a look at some

05:04.280 --> 05:09.280
examples from my YouTube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.560
Transgender communist degenerate. Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak. Degen

05:13.560 --> 05:17.960
tranny lal. Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens, or at

05:17.960 --> 05:21.280
least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses. Lol what's

05:21.280 --> 05:26.800
up with that? This is degeneracy. You oughta be slung from a tree. Everybody likes to rhyme.

05:26.800 --> 05:31.160
You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.160
The end.

05:32.160 --> 05:36.480
Aw, these people are trying so hard to upset me. They've only got one card in the deck

05:36.480 --> 05:37.480
though, alas.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.760
Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,

05:42.760 --> 05:47.280
like a burly nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired

05:47.280 --> 05:48.920
with a loathing of queerness.

05:48.920 --> 05:53.120
Now it's not always just about queerness. In fact, fascists and social conservatives

05:53.120 --> 05:58.880
use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists,

05:58.880 --> 06:03.560
communists, people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.680
But where does the word degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn

06:07.680 --> 06:08.680
more.

06:08.680 --> 06:16.560
The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix de-, which means away from, and the Latin

06:16.560 --> 06:21.840
word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be degenerate is to no longer be of your

06:21.840 --> 06:26.000
race or kind, and if you think this already sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
attention.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.920
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

06:31.920 --> 06:36.520
proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

06:36.520 --> 06:41.840
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,

06:41.840 --> 06:46.200
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

06:46.200 --> 06:50.280
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

06:50.280 --> 06:55.280
The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artour

06:55.280 --> 07:00.440
de Gabineau, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabineau wrote a book called Essay

07:00.440 --> 07:04.840
on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the Aryan master

07:04.840 --> 07:09.320
race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word degenerate

07:09.320 --> 07:11.200
its modern fashy definition.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.520
M'lord.

07:12.520 --> 07:18.680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

07:18.680 --> 07:24.840
intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,

07:24.840 --> 07:31.320
continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man

07:31.320 --> 07:37.480
of a decadent time, the degenerate man, properly so-called, is a different being from the racial

07:37.480 --> 07:43.120
point of view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that

07:43.120 --> 07:50.560
the human race and all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.

07:50.560 --> 07:55.720
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

07:55.720 --> 08:01.960
closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies

08:01.960 --> 08:06.880
a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence

08:06.880 --> 08:11.160
were everywhere in the European cultural imagination. During this period, German nationalist

08:11.160 --> 08:15.960
composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning Jewishness in music, which he first published

08:15.960 --> 08:20.760
under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally means free thought. That's right, he pulled

08:20.760 --> 08:22.400
the goddamn free speech card.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
ETHAN!

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
ETHAN!

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
ETHAN!

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
ETHAN!

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
ETHAN!

08:27.400 --> 08:28.400
ETHAN!

08:28.400 --> 08:29.400
ETHAN!

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
ETHAN!

08:30.400 --> 08:31.400
ETHAN!

08:31.400 --> 08:32.400
ETHAN!

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
ETHAN!

08:33.400 --> 08:34.400
ETHAN!

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
ETHAN!

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
ETHAN!

08:36.920 --> 08:39.600
In the 18th century, queer, absence-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the

08:39.600 --> 08:44.160
title of their movement. Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was

08:44.160 --> 08:45.920
4chan writ large.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.520
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.520
Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive

08:55.520 --> 09:00.120
goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

09:00.120 --> 09:04.840
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was

09:04.840 --> 09:10.020
that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch

09:10.020 --> 09:12.120
Visigoths and vandals.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.680
Is there any truth to that?

09:13.680 --> 09:18.600
No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors

09:18.600 --> 09:23.720
Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries. The empire didn't

09:23.720 --> 09:27.440
collapse till the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least 200 years between the

09:27.440 --> 09:31.120
decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.920
And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand

09:34.920 --> 09:35.920
years.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.000
Well, hail Caligula. But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient

09:41.000 --> 09:46.120
civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the

09:46.120 --> 09:48.520
transgenders destroy civilizations.

09:48.520 --> 09:56.920
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

09:56.920 --> 09:57.920
to unravel.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.720
Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.

10:01.720 --> 10:07.720
Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.

10:07.720 --> 10:13.720
You can see it happening all of a sudden. There's a kind of, you know, the sculptures

10:13.720 --> 10:19.720
of handsome, nude young men athletes that used to be very robust in the archaic period

10:19.720 --> 10:25.720
suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles toward the end. People who live in such times feel

10:26.520 --> 10:31.520
that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan. Homosexuality, heterosexuality,

10:31.520 --> 10:37.520
so what, anything goes and so on. But from the perspective of historical distance, you

10:37.520 --> 10:43.520
can see that it's a culture that no longer believes in itself. And then what you invariably

10:43.520 --> 10:51.520
get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity on the edges, whether

10:52.320 --> 10:57.320
they're the vandals, the Huns, or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS. You see them

10:57.320 --> 11:02.320
starting to mass on the outsides of the culture, and that's what we have right now. There's

11:02.320 --> 11:09.320
a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the transgender

11:09.320 --> 11:17.320
movement in our own culture and what's going on out there. I'm concerned, I feel it's

11:18.120 --> 11:26.120
ominous. I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

11:28.120 --> 11:33.120
Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

11:38.120 --> 11:43.120
So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed

11:43.920 --> 11:48.920
by real men. You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on. Where

11:48.920 --> 11:51.920
does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.920
Oh god, do we really have to do this?

11:54.920 --> 12:00.920
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich, who's every edgy 19-year-old's

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
favorite philosopher.

12:01.920 --> 12:08.920
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets, Dionysian in the streets.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.720
Shh, go to sleep.

12:11.720 --> 12:15.720
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,

12:15.720 --> 12:20.720
is decadent, in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society, we have all these hang-ups

12:20.720 --> 12:24.720
about guilt and sin and the afterlife. And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with

12:24.720 --> 12:28.720
people who are weak and sick, and that they repress our basic biological instincts to

12:28.720 --> 12:31.720
value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.720
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.520
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea

12:40.520 --> 12:44.520
of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.520
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about,

12:48.520 --> 12:53.520
like, fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay,

12:53.520 --> 12:57.520
I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.320
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism

13:02.320 --> 13:06.320
was really kicking into gear, European society was already primed with a couple centuries

13:06.320 --> 13:10.320
of degeneracy discourse. Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and

13:10.320 --> 13:16.320
Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism, namely 1. The German

13:16.320 --> 13:22.320
people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay. 2. The

13:23.120 --> 13:27.120
Jews, Poles, Roma, Homosexuals, Communists, and the Disabled are degenerate elements that

13:27.120 --> 13:31.120
contribute to decay. And 3. The degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure

13:31.120 --> 13:33.120
the health and existence of the organism.

13:33.120 --> 13:37.120
So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.120
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc. One particular thing I've noticed about modern

13:41.120 --> 13:45.120
fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white,

13:45.120 --> 13:49.120
black, and brown. And that's not to say that they don't have a history.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.920
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like

13:55.920 --> 13:59.920
rats. And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

13:59.920 --> 14:05.920
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta

14:05.920 --> 14:11.920
male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married, not having kids, having kids

14:11.920 --> 14:15.920
that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
birth control, having abortions.

14:20.720 --> 14:28.720
Condoms and dorjies and mass immigration, malt liquor forties and miscegenation,

14:28.720 --> 14:36.720
boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.720
Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

14:40.720 --> 14:44.720
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.720
There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be

14:50.720 --> 14:52.720
responsible and I hate it.

14:52.720 --> 14:57.920
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about

14:57.920 --> 15:03.520
driving, okay? Drink lots of water, and pace yourself. There's plenty of time to be blackout

15:03.520 --> 15:06.720
when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.520
Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you

15:12.320 --> 15:17.120
situations with really horrible people, so I would never recommend that anyone get involved

15:17.120 --> 15:19.120
with alcohol for any reason.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.320
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.320
Where were we?

15:28.320 --> 15:35.120
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms,

15:35.120 --> 15:42.720
antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things!

15:50.720 --> 15:52.720
Hi there.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
I hope you're having

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
a soothing

15:56.720 --> 15:58.720
degenerate bath.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
What I want you to do is just

16:02.720 --> 16:04.720
lie back and

16:05.520 --> 16:07.520
try to relax.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
And I am

16:09.520 --> 16:11.520
just going to

16:11.520 --> 16:13.520
slowly start to drip

16:13.520 --> 16:15.520
hot candle wax

16:25.520 --> 16:30.720
So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white

16:30.720 --> 16:35.280
procreation is degenerate, and individual fascists differ on what those things are.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.280
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people

16:39.280 --> 16:44.480
can't raise children. Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one

16:44.480 --> 16:48.640
subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning

16:48.640 --> 16:52.960
out clean-cut heterosexual white kids. And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get

16:52.960 --> 16:58.000
basic social conservatism. So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk

16:58.000 --> 17:02.960
about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles. Speaking of which, a lot of rightists

17:02.960 --> 17:07.920
have realized that in the 21st century, the social conservative position is not very cool. So what

17:07.920 --> 17:12.960
they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a

17:12.960 --> 17:18.560
problem with is the gay agenda. What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness. Now, what

17:18.560 --> 17:23.120
is queerness? Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most

17:23.120 --> 17:28.000
generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing, so either your gender is all

17:28.000 --> 17:32.880
fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners. But unlike the words homosexual or

17:32.880 --> 17:38.000
transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion, often rebellion against the

17:38.000 --> 17:42.640
heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.120
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and

17:47.120 --> 17:52.320
transgender people, but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act

17:52.320 --> 17:57.440
as normal as possible. What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness, because think of

17:57.440 --> 18:03.760
the children. We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters,

18:03.760 --> 18:11.520
polyamorists, sing it with me, these are my favorite degenerate things. To fascists, the pursuit of

18:11.520 --> 18:16.560
individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race. So in a sense,

18:16.560 --> 18:21.200
traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism, which only

18:21.200 --> 18:25.760
demands the communal ownership of the means of production. At least in theory, communism doesn't

18:25.760 --> 18:30.880
tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck. In practice though, there's not a single position

18:30.880 --> 18:34.800
on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy. While I was

18:34.800 --> 18:39.280
researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper

18:39.280 --> 18:41.360
from 1976 that claims,

18:41.360 --> 18:45.680
While we communists oppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,

18:45.760 --> 18:51.280
we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right. Homosexuality is a form of social sickness,

18:51.280 --> 18:57.360
a form of social perversion. It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to

18:57.360 --> 19:02.880
the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom. Homosexuality arose from class

19:02.880 --> 19:05.040
oppression and the oppression of women.

19:05.040 --> 19:09.920
Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh? We've got the fascists

19:09.920 --> 19:14.800
calling us sexual bolshevists, and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

19:14.800 --> 19:19.600
Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?

19:49.600 --> 19:54.160
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and pro-creative.

19:54.160 --> 19:58.080
And you know, that's probably for the best. Someone needs to have the babies and keep

19:58.080 --> 20:03.040
society running. All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights

20:03.040 --> 20:07.680
and peace. My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind. In the

20:07.680 --> 20:11.280
perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you

20:11.280 --> 20:15.520
worry about that. And that's the difference between me and the fascists. I want a society

20:15.520 --> 20:19.680
where people like me are simply allowed to exist. And, this is the important part, where

20:19.680 --> 20:24.560
people not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people

20:24.560 --> 20:29.120
like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is

20:29.120 --> 20:33.280
to be the only survivor. So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence

20:33.280 --> 20:37.120
of priests, which is to say bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a

20:37.120 --> 20:41.920
giant tax-exempt drain on the economy, well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who

20:41.920 --> 20:46.480
crack nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs. So if you think the meaning

20:46.480 --> 20:50.800
of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine. Go make

20:50.800 --> 20:55.280
white babies. But I really must insist, upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,

20:55.280 --> 21:00.320
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race-mixing, sexual anarchy,

21:00.320 --> 21:01.120
and rock and roll.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.320
Rock and roll.

21:06.560 --> 21:14.400
A rock-on, gold-dust woman, take your silver spoon, take your grain.

21:20.880 --> 21:28.720
I wake up in the morning, see your sunrise loves to go down.

21:31.280 --> 21:45.520
Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud, cry out.

21:48.400 --> 21:55.120
Well, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love? Well,

21:55.120 --> 22:01.360
tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

22:07.760 --> 22:15.280
Rock on, ancient queen, follow those who fail and you're shut down.

22:15.280 --> 22:28.480
Ah, that was jack it up. Rulers make bad lovers, you better put your king and dumb up for sale.

22:31.440 --> 22:40.160
One more time. Oh, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love?

22:40.160 --> 22:53.360
Well, tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

22:55.040 --> 23:07.360
Rock and roll.
