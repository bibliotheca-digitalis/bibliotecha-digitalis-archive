00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello boys! I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
sure what that means. I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,920
is a glorious knight of wisdom to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man. Some

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,820
call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant paladin

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,600
of the Fourth Reich. But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the Golden

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
One.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:01:04,680
Oh my god. Look at his butt. Oh my god. Daddy, can I have some meat? Looks like meat's back

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,640
on the menu, boys! Oh daddy. You know Lars, things have really changed since the last

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,280
time we talked. I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,040
I started my transition, so in a sense, I'm a virgin. And I don't know about the rest

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,200
of these decadent sluts, but I for one care about a little thing called purity. So, now

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
that my decade of gender dysphoric alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming to a close,

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,660
I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master. But first, let us fend off degeneracy

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,640
by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water and pure absinthe. It's time.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Down, down, I always wanna die on my own. I never really cared until I met you.

16
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,400
What? Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation? It is, isn't it? Well, mmm, they're shiny

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
and I want them. It's not my fault black people have good ideas. What am I supposed to do?

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,560
Not steal them? I'll pop it out. Alright, thou resplendent champion of the north, hit

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:37,680
me with your finest wisdom. I'm gonna go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror.

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,480
There's always a nice thing to do. Well, at least we agree on something.

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,880
Aha! Autogynephilic narcissistic spose! Abigail, isn't not invading women's bathrooms

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,360
like your whole thing? Misogynistic mental illness confirmed!

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Abigail, what is your damage? Are you okay? How's your mom doing? Is everything alright?

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:24,960
You wanna get in the tub? Ow. So you're a lost baby girl and you're a game sweet prince.

25
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,080
He has an Instagram and it is delectable. Meets back on the menu, boys. He carries the

26
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:43,200
Charles Atlas Seal of Approval. What ho, you jaunty lads. My captain, my king. Yaaas.

27
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,480
If the golden one didn't exist I would have to invent him. I need him. And maybe you need

28
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,160
me too, Lars. I'm the moon to your sun, the Brune Hilda to your Siegfried. As you become

29
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,880
more of a burly mask, I become more of a silky fem. But you know, I'm noticing that even

30
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,280
though you're straight, you don't seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your

31
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,040
life. And this is just a casual suggestion, but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like

32
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,840
me. I'm not like the other girls. I've got the t's and the d. On second thought, leave

33
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,000
trans women alone. I don't want that blood on my hands. Well, this is no longer a relaxing

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,040
bath, and that's why we never bathe with fascists.

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Well, I've locked my t, I've popped my e, let's talk about degeneracy. What are people

36
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,280
talking about when they call someone or something degenerate? Well, let's take a look at some

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,280
examples from my YouTube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context.

38
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Transgender communist degenerate. Kill yourself you fucking degenerate tranny freak. Degen

39
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,960
tranny lal. Trannies grow out of their degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens, or at

40
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,280
least that's what I would assume since you never see old dudes in dresses. Lol what's

41
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,800
up with that? This is degeneracy. You oughta be slung from a tree. Everybody likes to rhyme.

42
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,160
You little homos are future cannon fodder, a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs.

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
The end.

44
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,480
Aw, these people are trying so hard to upset me. They've only got one card in the deck

45
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
though, alas.

46
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,760
Anyway, what I'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuckboys is that,

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,280
like a burly nord with his fair maiden, the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired

48
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,920
with a loathing of queerness.

49
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,120
Now it's not always just about queerness. In fact, fascists and social conservatives

50
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
use the word degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists,

51
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,560
communists, people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

52
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,680
But where does the word degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
more.

54
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,560
The word degenerate comes from the Latin prefix de-, which means away from, and the Latin

55
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,840
word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be degenerate is to no longer be of your

56
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,000
race or kind, and if you think this already sounds pretty fashy, you've been paying

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
attention.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,920
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

59
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,520
proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

60
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,840
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to degeneration theory,

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,200
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,280
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

63
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,280
The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat Artour

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,440
de Gabineau, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabineau wrote a book called Essay

65
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,840
on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the Aryan master

66
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,320
race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word degenerate

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,200
its modern fashy definition.

68
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
M'lord.

69
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

70
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,840
intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins,

71
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,320
continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man

72
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,480
of a decadent time, the degenerate man, properly so-called, is a different being from the racial

73
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,120
point of view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,560
the human race and all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.

75
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,720
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

76
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,960
closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,880
a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence

78
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,160
were everywhere in the European cultural imagination. During this period, German nationalist

79
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,960
composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning Jewishness in music, which he first published

80
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,760
under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally means free thought. That's right, he pulled

81
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,400
the goddamn free speech card.

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
ETHAN!

83
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
ETHAN!

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
ETHAN!

85
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
ETHAN!

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
ETHAN!

87
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
ETHAN!

88
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
ETHAN!

89
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
ETHAN!

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
ETHAN!

91
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
ETHAN!

92
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
ETHAN!

93
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
ETHAN!

94
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
ETHAN!

95
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
ETHAN!

96
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,600
In the 18th century, queer, absence-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,160
title of their movement. Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was

98
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,920
4chan writ large.

99
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,520
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly new then.

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive

101
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,120
goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

102
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,840
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,020
that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch

104
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,120
Visigoths and vandals.

105
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
Is there any truth to that?

106
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,600
No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors

107
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,720
Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus reigned from the first to the third centuries. The empire didn't

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,440
collapse till the end of the fifth century, which leaves at least 200 years between the

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian.

110
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,920
And in any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand

111
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
years.

112
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, hail Caligula. But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,120
civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the

114
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,520
transgenders destroy civilizations.

115
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,920
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

116
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
to unravel.

117
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.

118
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.

119
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,720
You can see it happening all of a sudden. There's a kind of, you know, the sculptures

120
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,720
of handsome, nude young men athletes that used to be very robust in the archaic period

121
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,720
suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles toward the end. People who live in such times feel

122
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan. Homosexuality, heterosexuality,

123
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,520
so what, anything goes and so on. But from the perspective of historical distance, you

124
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,520
can see that it's a culture that no longer believes in itself. And then what you invariably

125
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,520
get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity on the edges, whether

126
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,320
they're the vandals, the Huns, or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS. You see them

127
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,320
starting to mass on the outsides of the culture, and that's what we have right now. There's

128
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,320
a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect between the infatuation with the transgender

129
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:17,320
movement in our own culture and what's going on out there. I'm concerned, I feel it's

130
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:26,120
ominous. I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

131
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

132
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,120
So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed

133
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,920
by real men. You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on. Where

134
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
does fucking Nietzsche fit into all of this?

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Oh god, do we really have to do this?

136
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,920
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich, who's every edgy 19-year-old's

137
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
favorite philosopher.

138
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets, Dionysian in the streets.

139
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Shh, go to sleep.

140
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western culture, especially Christianity,

141
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,720
is decadent, in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society, we have all these hang-ups

142
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
about guilt and sin and the afterlife. And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with

143
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
people who are weak and sick, and that they repress our basic biological instincts to

144
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

145
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,720
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

146
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,520
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea

147
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
of universal human equality to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryan studs.

148
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about,

149
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,520
like, fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus, which, okay,

150
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

151
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism

152
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
was really kicking into gear, European society was already primed with a couple centuries

153
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
of degeneracy discourse. Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and

154
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism, namely 1. The German

155
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,320
people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay. 2. The

156
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Jews, Poles, Roma, Homosexuals, Communists, and the Disabled are degenerate elements that

157
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
contribute to decay. And 3. The degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure

158
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
the health and existence of the organism.

159
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,120
So there you have it, the history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc. One particular thing I've noticed about modern

161
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white,

162
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
black, and brown. And that's not to say that they don't have a history.

163
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like

164
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
rats. And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

165
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,920
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta

166
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,920
male, being a slut, being a feminist, not getting married, not having kids, having kids

167
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
that aren't white, masturbating, looking at porn, drinking alcohol, doing drugs, using

168
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
birth control, having abortions.

169
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Condoms and dorjies and mass immigration, malt liquor forties and miscegenation,

170
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,720
boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings, these are my favorite degenerate things.

171
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Very cute, but don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

172
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

173
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,720
There's like ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me, so I have to be

174
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
responsible and I hate it.

175
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,920
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you, but don't even think about

176
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,520
driving, okay? Drink lots of water, and pace yourself. There's plenty of time to be blackout

177
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,720
when you're dead, and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

178
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,520
Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation, and it can put you

179
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
situations with really horrible people, so I would never recommend that anyone get involved

180
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
with alcohol for any reason.

181
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.

182
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Where were we?

183
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,120
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm, estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms,

184
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,720
antifa furries and denby drag kings, these are my favorite degenerate things!

185
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Hi there.

186
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I hope you're having

187
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
a soothing

188
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
degenerate bath.

189
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
What I want you to do is just

190
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
lie back and

191
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
try to relax.

192
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
And I am

193
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
just going to

194
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
slowly start to drip

195
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
hot candle wax

196
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,720
So for fascists and identitarians, anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white

197
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,280
procreation is degenerate, and individual fascists differ on what those things are.

198
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate because apparently gay people

199
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,480
can't raise children. Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one

200
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,640
subservient white woman because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning

201
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,960
out clean-cut heterosexual white kids. And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get

202
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,000
basic social conservatism. So this really isn't just about fascism, though I do like to talk

203
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,960
about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles. Speaking of which, a lot of rightists

204
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,920
have realized that in the 21st century, the social conservative position is not very cool. So what

205
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,960
they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals, what they have a

206
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,560
problem with is the gay agenda. What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness. Now, what

207
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,120
is queerness? Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this, but in its most

208
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,000
generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing, so either your gender is all

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,880
fucked up or you have creative tastes and sexual partners. But unlike the words homosexual or

210
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,000
transgender, queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion, often rebellion against the

211
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

212
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,120
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and

213
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,320
transgender people, but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act

214
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,440
as normal as possible. What they can't stand is loud non-conformist queerness, because think of

215
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,760
the children. We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks, kinksters,

216
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,520
polyamorists, sing it with me, these are my favorite degenerate things. To fascists, the pursuit of

217
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,560
individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race. So in a sense,

218
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,200
traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism, which only

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,760
demands the communal ownership of the means of production. At least in theory, communism doesn't

220
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,880
tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck. In practice though, there's not a single position

221
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,800
on the political spectrum that's immune to complaining about degeneracy. While I was

222
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,280
researching this video, I randomly came across an article from an American communist newspaper

223
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
from 1976 that claims,

224
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,680
While we communists oppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,

225
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,280
we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right. Homosexuality is a form of social sickness,

226
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,360
a form of social perversion. It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to

227
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,880
the petty bourgeoisie because of its appearance as sexual freedom. Homosexuality arose from class

228
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
oppression and the oppression of women.

229
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,920
Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh? We've got the fascists

230
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,800
calling us sexual bolshevists, and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

231
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,600
Why does everyone hate decadents so much? Is pleasure really so wrong?

232
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,160
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and pro-creative.

233
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,080
And you know, that's probably for the best. Someone needs to have the babies and keep

234
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,040
society running. All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights

235
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,680
and peace. My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind. In the

236
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,280
perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you

237
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,520
worry about that. And that's the difference between me and the fascists. I want a society

238
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,680
where people like me are simply allowed to exist. And, this is the important part, where

239
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,560
people not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people

240
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,120
like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is

241
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,280
to be the only survivor. So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence

242
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
of priests, which is to say bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a

243
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,920
giant tax-exempt drain on the economy, well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who

244
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,480
crack nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you songs. So if you think the meaning

245
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,800
of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine. Go make

246
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,280
white babies. But I really must insist, upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,

247
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,320
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race-mixing, sexual anarchy,

248
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,120
and rock and roll.

249
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Rock and roll.

250
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:14,400
A rock-on, gold-dust woman, take your silver spoon, take your grain.

251
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,720
I wake up in the morning, see your sunrise loves to go down.

252
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:45,520
Lousy lovers pick their prey, but they never cry out loud, cry out.

253
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,120
Well, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love? Well,

254
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,360
tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

255
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,280
Rock on, ancient queen, follow those who fail and you're shut down.

256
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:28,480
Ah, that was jack it up. Rulers make bad lovers, you better put your king and dumb up for sale.

257
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:40,160
One more time. Oh, did she make you cry, make you break down, shatter your illusions of love?

258
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:53,360
Well, tell me, is it over now? Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go home?

259
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:07,360
Rock and roll.
