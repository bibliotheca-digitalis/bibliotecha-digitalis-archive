28000	31000	Oh, hey, Quarch. Hey, how are you, Quarch?
31000	34000	Okay, listen. I know this looks bad.
34000	37000	I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.
37000	39000	Well, fair enough.
39000	42000	But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?
42000	43000	How about this?
43000	46000	I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,
46000	49000	but first, you have to let me tell you my life story.
49000	51000	Fair? That's super fucking great.
51000	54000	Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.
54000	55000	I'll start at the beginning.
55000	59000	My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.
59000	61000	I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,
61000	65000	where the most exciting attraction for children is the National Museum of Natural History.
65000	68000	At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children,
68000	73000	who, might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.
73000	76000	Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,
76000	79000	I liked a good stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,
79000	82000	but my real passion was the Gem and Mineral Hall.
82000	84000	Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.
84000	87000	It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.
87000	91000	I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.
91000	94000	The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up
94000	98000	for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.
98000	101000	Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.
101000	105000	Comrades, losers, and haters, I would like to propose
105000	111000	that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,
111000	114000	begins with absolute pleasure.
114000	119000	You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.
119000	122000	Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.
122000	124000	Yes, God!
124000	127000	But as you get older, things get more complicated.
127000	130000	Northern Virginia is McMansion country,
130000	133000	and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,
133000	135000	I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,
135000	138000	looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,
138000	140000	and I would get excited by some little detail,
140000	145000	like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.
145000	146000	But then my mom would say,
146000	149000	Look at this ostentatious trash!
149000	150000	So you learn.
150000	153000	You learn taste according to the social class of your upbringing.
153000	156000	And with taste comes all this adult baggage,
156000	159000	snobbery and pretense and conceit.
159000	162000	So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,
162000	165000	but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.
165000	170000	I am but a simple queen longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.
170000	174000	So, stripey sock catgirls of the heckin' Revolutionary Committee,
174000	176000	before you pass sentence,
176000	178000	allow me to make my case gorge.
196000	199000	One. Success.
200000	202000	Oh hey, how are you, gorge?
202000	204000	Look, I like stuff.
204000	206000	I like shiny things.
206000	210000	For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.
210000	214000	But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.
214000	217000	There's a social context for it.
217000	219000	It generally means something.
219000	223000	Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator
223000	225000	and moved into a cheesecake factory?
225000	227000	Well, because he's trying to send a message.
227000	230000	Maybe to the world, maybe to himself.
230000	231000	He's saying,
231000	237000	Behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.
237000	240000	Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power,
240000	243000	from the pharaohs of Egypt to the kings of France
243000	246000	to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.
246000	248000	I guess God likes shiny things too.
248000	253000	In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.
253000	258000	It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American Dream.
258000	262000	The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.
262000	263000	In the words of Drake,
263000	265000	Started from the bottom, now we're here.
265000	269000	Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.
269000	273000	Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.
273000	274000	You've made it.
274000	275000	You're rich, bitch.
275000	277000	Remember in high school when you had to read
277000	280000	The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?
280000	283000	The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties,
283000	287000	but he throws them anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it,
287000	290000	that he's a success, that he's worth something.
290000	292000	And as we all remember, in the end,
292000	296000	they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to save the Hall of Hrothgar.
296000	299000	At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay
299000	304000	about how the theme of The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.
304000	305000	I got a D minus.
305000	309000	I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining,
309000	311000	I like those Balenciagas.
311000	312000	Fuck.
312000	314000	I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms
314000	316000	and driving lambs and all that shit,
316000	319000	but teacher, pick me, pick me.
319000	320000	Let's talk about symbols.
320000	321000	Let's talk about allegory.
321000	322000	Let's talk about metaphor.
322000	324000	Let's talk about themes.
324000	329000	Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.
329000	332000	Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper
332000	334000	to making money moves.
334000	336000	That's the American Dream.
336000	340000	Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.
340000	344000	It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds
344000	346000	where that kind of success is really improbable.
346000	349000	Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say,
349000	353000	rap music is the reason for the problems with the blacks?
353000	358000	For conservatives, the American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.
358000	360000	And is there any sector of our culture
360000	364000	where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated than hip-hop?
364000	366000	It's not just hip-hop, though.
366000	369000	Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.
369000	372000	You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci
372000	374000	and the Ferraris and the Fendi and the Bugattis
374000	376000	and the Armani and the Maseratis.
376000	381000	Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit.
381000	384000	Which, to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.
384000	387000	Burn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care
387000	390000	and replace it with a large-scale figure of Donatello Versace
390000	392000	holding a bottle of Cristal.
392000	394000	That's at least a more honest representation of our culture
394000	398000	than the hypocritical cheese furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.
398000	400000	I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?
400000	402000	Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.
402000	404000	We have standards in this country.
404000	406000	Listen up, America.
406000	408000	We live in a society.
408000	411000	A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
411000	415000	Not of climbers, but of graspers.
415000	417000	To paraphrase Ian Danskin,
417000	420000	maybe anyone can achieve the American dream,
420000	422000	but everyone cannot.
422000	424000	And the fact of the matter is,
424000	426000	most people don't.
426000	428000	I mean, what would it even mean to be rich
428000	430000	unless someone else was poor?
430000	432000	I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?
432000	434000	Not other rich people, that's for sure.
434000	436000	So when you live in a society
436000	438000	that constantly equates wealth and success,
438000	440000	but which is also so unequal
440000	442000	that most people will never be wealthy,
443000	447000	well, what's the average person supposed to do?
447000	449000	Two, fantasy.
451000	453000	I wish the world were my gem collection.
453000	455000	I wish I owned everything.
455000	458000	I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?
458000	460000	I go to an art museum and it's like,
460000	462000	Monet, Rembrandt,
462000	464000	okay, that's super fucking great,
464000	465000	but can I buy it?
465000	467000	Well, no, I can't buy it.
467000	470000	The grim reality is, you can't own everything.
470000	472000	So what do you do?
472000	474000	Well, you fake it.
474000	476000	You create an illusion.
476000	478000	I don't own this building,
478000	480000	and you rube off the streets of Baltimore
480000	482000	and walk in here, as indeed you did.
482000	484000	But that's okay. I need a witness.
484000	486000	I need you to see me here
486000	488000	among the other art,
488000	490000	where I belong.
490000	493000	Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?
493000	495000	It makes me feel valuable.
495000	498000	You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent,
498000	501000	because opulence is not abundance.
501000	504000	Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.
504000	507000	It is the aesthetic of owning everything.
508000	511000	The phrase, opulence, you own everything,
511000	514000	is at this point, basically a gay internet meme.
514000	515000	Opulence.
515000	517000	Opulence, opulence, opulence, opulence.
517000	519000	But it originally comes from the documentary
519000	520000	Paris is Burning,
520000	523000	about the Harlem ballroom culture in the 1980s,
523000	525000	where it's proclaimed by MC Jr. LaBeija.
525000	530000	O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.
530000	532000	Opulence.
532000	534000	You own everything.
534000	536000	It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle
536000	538000	of luxury and decadence.
538000	540000	In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says
540000	542000	of the queer Black and Latin American participants
542000	543000	of the balls,
543000	545000	A lot of those kids that are in the balls,
545000	547000	they don't have two of nothing.
547000	549000	Some of them don't even eat.
549000	552000	So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamor,
552000	555000	an illusion created by skillful artifice.
555000	557000	Participants walk categories like executive realness,
557000	559000	with the goal of being indistinguishable
559000	561000	from a real executive.
561000	563000	Nowadays every white queer says the word realness,
563000	565000	I guess in kind of a frivolous way.
565000	568000	I mean, whomst among us honestly hasn't
568000	570000	slipped into a dissociative fugue state,
570000	572000	dressed up as a clown,
572000	574000	kidnapped a few neighborhood children,
574000	575000	and told the cops,
575000	578000	I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.
578000	579000	I did it, officer.
579000	581000	I did the cultural appropriation.
581000	582000	I am a colonizer.
582000	584000	I am part of the problem.
584000	585000	And I'm sorry.
585000	587000	Take me away, boys.
587000	588000	That's crazy.
588000	589000	That's mega coconuts.
589000	592000	I guess I should explain that American slang works
592000	593000	according to what we might call
593000	595000	a trickle-up model of linguistics.
595000	598000	All the new words are invented by the most marginalized
598000	599000	gay and trans people of color.
599000	602000	Then those words trickle up to straight Black people
602000	603000	and white gays,
603000	605000	and then finally white cishets start using them.
605000	607000	A lot of times the original meaning or context
607000	609000	gets lost along the way.
609000	612000	So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,
612000	615000	was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,
615000	618000	but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm
618000	621000	between what is being emulated and what is absent,
621000	625000	namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.
625000	627000	Realness, in that sense,
627000	629000	is a much more complicated and interesting concept
629000	632000	than the generic trans notion of passing.
632000	633000	Passing is just looking like
633000	635000	a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl,
635000	637000	whereas in the ballroom sense,
637000	640000	realness has a subtext of defying injustice.
640000	643000	You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle
643000	646000	that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.
646000	648000	You're not really an executive,
648000	649000	but you're looking like an executive,
649000	651000	and therefore you're showing the straight world
651000	653000	that I can be an executive.
653000	655000	If I had the opportunity, I could be one,
655000	657000	because I can look like one.
657000	659000	I think one reason there's been a surge of interest
659000	662000	in 80s ballroom culture, such as the FX drama Pose,
662000	664000	which is set during the era,
664000	667000	is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.
667000	669000	It's really important to people in this country
669000	672000	to at least sometimes feel like they're living a luxe life,
672000	674000	even if in fact, they aren't.
674000	676000	Las Vegas is essentially an entire city
676000	678000	that exploits that need.
678000	680000	Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio,
680000	682000	and Caesar's Palace are designed
682000	684000	to make you feel like a fancy bitch,
684000	686000	even though they're actually just high-rise traps
686000	688000	designed to lure you in and take your money.
688000	690000	And if there's one thing I can't stand,
690000	695000	it's traps.
695000	700000	But the trap works,
700000	702000	because part of what it is to be American
702000	704000	is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.
704000	706000	I actually love Vegas.
706000	708000	I was there last year for the only good YouTuber
708000	710000	Lindsay Ellis' bachelorette party.
710000	712000	I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.
712000	715000	But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s,
715000	718000	I did once experience the first exciting stages
718000	719000	of a gambling habit.
719000	722000	I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,
722000	724000	and had some good luck playing blackjack.
724000	726000	I mean, I wasn't a high roller or anything,
726000	729000	but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.
729000	731000	And that was a lot of money to me.
731000	733000	At the time, I was working a customer service job
733000	735000	making $10 an hour,
735000	738000	so to make $200 in five minutes,
738000	740000	that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing
740000	742000	customer service toil.
742000	744000	Before taxes.
744000	746000	So I went back and I went back,
746000	748000	but I never got lucky again.
748000	751000	And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.
751000	753000	I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,
753000	756000	I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face
756000	760000	that I have never seen on a human being before or since.
760000	763000	Just absolute shock, despair,
763000	766000	this deep shame and self-disgust.
766000	767000	The kind of face that says,
767000	769000	I'm gonna have to explain to my wife
769000	771000	that I spent the kids' college savings
771000	773000	on a high-limit slot machine.
773000	775000	And there is nothing opulent about that,
775000	778000	nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips
778000	780000	trying to pay off their hospital bills.
780000	784000	America, we are a bad country.
784000	786000	Donald Trump is a Vegas man,
786000	788000	he's pulling this grift on the entire country.
788000	791000	And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence
791000	795000	of the American dream is more enchanting to the imagination
795000	798000	than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.
798000	801000	So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,
801000	804000	but in fact, there are two very different types of magic
804000	805000	at work.
805000	808000	For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,
808000	810000	a demonstration of their wealth and power.
810000	812000	But for the marginalized and impoverished,
812000	815000	opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power
815000	816000	they've been denied.
816000	819000	The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,
819000	823000	it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly
823000	825000	serving viper realness.
825000	828000	Three, class.
828000	829000	Hey, how are you?
829000	830000	Hey, how are you?
830000	832000	Hey, how are you?
832000	833000	Hey, how are you?
833000	834000	Hey, how are you?
834000	836000	People don't understand how difficult it is
836000	837000	to be this blonde.
837000	840000	You know, a biological female that looks like me,
840000	842000	I'm afraid some transvestite psycho
842000	844000	is gonna sneak in through a rear window
844000	846000	and I'll have to dial M for murder.
846000	848000	I get vertigo just thinking about it.
848000	850000	I've always found the Marxist analysis of class
850000	852000	difficult to apply to the present day.
852000	853000	As a typical modern woman,
853000	856000	it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.
856000	858000	And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.
858000	859000	That's praxis.
859000	862000	Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat?
862000	863000	Whomst?
863000	864000	Who is she?
864000	865000	Where's her summer collection?
865000	867000	That's super fucking great, but can I buy it?
867000	870000	Marx's typical examples are a factory owner
870000	871000	and a factory worker.
871000	873000	Now, I could be out of touch,
873000	876000	but personally, I've never met a factory worker,
876000	878000	or a factory owner for that matter.
878000	880000	They must all be on a brand trip to China,
880000	882000	working on the B&P summer collection.
882000	885000	What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles
885000	887000	is that the bougies own the means of production
887000	888000	and the proles work for wages.
888000	891000	But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?
891000	893000	What about YouTubers?
893000	895000	Which side of the revolution are we on?
895000	897000	I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here,
897000	899000	because if the revolution starts on Twitter,
899000	901000	my head is definitely going in the basket,
901000	902000	and then I'll have no choice
902000	904000	but to do the conservative talk show circuit.
904000	906000	You know, like most people
906000	908000	whose brains are detached from their bodies.
908000	911000	Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, A-R-U.
911000	913000	I feel like a class analysis with only two classes
913000	915000	must be overly simplistic.
915000	917000	My favorite book about class in America
917000	918000	is Paul Fussell's Class,
918000	921000	A Guide Through the American Status System,
921000	923000	which describes nine distinct classes.
923000	924000	Fussell is not as concerned
924000	926000	with economic relations between classes
926000	928000	as he is with status,
928000	931000	what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.
931000	933000	Things like education, style, taste,
933000	935000	and attitude towards money.
935000	937000	Now the book was published in 1983,
937000	940000	so a lot of the references and details are out of date,
940000	942000	but there's an eerie familiarity
942000	943000	to a lot of the core observations.
943000	945000	And it's also just pretty funny,
945000	947000	like his quasi-scientific observation
947000	949000	that the higher your social class,
949000	951000	the smaller the balls in the sports you play,
951000	953000	or his description of middle-class living rooms.
953000	956000	Your real middle class refuses to show
956000	959000	any but the most bland books and magazines
959000	960000	on its coffee tables.
960000	962000	Otherwise, expressions of opinion,
962000	966000	awkward questions, or even ideas might result.
966000	967000	One of Fussell's core themes
967000	969000	is that it's not how much money you have
969000	970000	that defines your class,
970000	972000	so much as how you got your money.
972000	974000	If you had to work for your money,
974000	976000	then you're not really upper class.
976000	978000	The upper class has inherited wealth,
978000	980000	and as a result they're very confident
980000	983000	they don't feel the need to prove themselves.
983000	986000	Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted
986000	988000	their position on the ladder.
988000	989000	But then there's the middle class,
989000	990000	who are social climbers,
990000	993000	and who compensate for their insecurities by,
993000	996000	for example, placing a pretentious collage
996000	999000	of university bumper stickers on the back of the family car.
999000	1001000	This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.
1002000	1003000	The higher and lower classes,
1003000	1004000	there's some good in them,
1004000	1007000	but the middle classes are all affectation
1007000	1010000	and conceit and pretense and concealment.
1010000	1013000	Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated
1013000	1015000	by people with something to prove,
1015000	1017000	whether it's marginalized ballroom performers
1017000	1019000	proving their worth to themselves
1019000	1021000	or the new rich building McMansions
1021000	1023000	to show off their wealth to others.
1023000	1025000	So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.
1025000	1026000	He inherited his wealth,
1026000	1030000	so he should know better than to have golden faucets.
1030000	1031000	But he doesn't.
1031000	1033000	As Fran Lebowitz said,
1033000	1036000	he's a poor person's idea of a rich person.
1036000	1038000	And that's actually his charm.
1038000	1040000	It's part of his mass appeal.
1040000	1043000	Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery.
1043000	1045000	So there's actually something kind of relatable,
1045000	1047000	unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic
1047000	1049000	about the golden faucets.
1049000	1051000	People who have wealth but not class
1051000	1054000	are actually very popular in this country.
1054000	1056000	We don't like class here,
1056000	1058000	because class is exclusionary.
1059000	1061000	Whereas anyone can acquire wealth,
1061000	1062000	we tell ourselves.
1062000	1065000	So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone,
1065000	1068000	even though in practice, it isn't.
1068000	1070000	Now the upper-class cultural elite in this country,
1070000	1072000	the real classy people,
1072000	1074000	are mostly very unlike Trump.
1074000	1076000	Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,
1076000	1078000	they embrace the reserved old-money values
1078000	1080000	of aristocratic wasps,
1080000	1082000	white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
1082000	1084000	Fussell notes, for instance,
1084000	1087000	that they tend to value privacy over showing off.
1087000	1089000	They like to live at the end of long driveways
1089000	1091000	and houses away from public view.
1091000	1092000	They dress down while traveling
1092000	1095000	so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
1095000	1097000	These are essentially survival skills
1097000	1098000	of the experienced rich.
1098000	1100000	If you flaunt your wealth too much,
1100000	1101000	people might rob you,
1101000	1103000	or they might get envious
1103000	1105000	and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.
1105000	1108000	Or worse, taxation.
1108000	1110000	Old money knows this,
1110000	1112000	but new money just cannot resist
1112000	1114000	the temptation to show off.
1114000	1116000	I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class
1116000	1117000	is dying out.
1117000	1119000	I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory
1119000	1121000	of money over class.
1121000	1123000	His presidency validates the idea
1123000	1125000	that you can be as vulgar as you want
1125000	1127000	so long as you have the cash to back it up.
1127000	1129000	So the old class system is dying out,
1129000	1131000	and in its place,
1131000	1133000	we have universally adopted the mindset
1133000	1134000	of the nouveau riche.
1134000	1136000	If you got it, flaunt it.
1136000	1137000	If you haven't got it,
1137000	1139000	find a way to flaunt it anyway.
1139000	1141000	Now I'm sure this is all very tragic
1141000	1143000	and disappointing to people of class and taste,
1143000	1147000	but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur,
1147000	1149000	it's actually fantastic news.
1154000	1156000	Listen comrades,
1156000	1158000	I've been pretty down on opulence so far,
1158000	1160000	and I could continue analyzing it
1160000	1162000	in terms of inequality and class struggle,
1162000	1164000	but you already know all that.
1164000	1166000	That's why you came to cut my head off.
1166000	1168000	But hold on,
1168000	1170000	is that really all there is to aesthetics,
1170000	1172000	Marxist economic analysis,
1172000	1174000	or the SJW version
1174000	1176000	that makes everything about race and gender?
1176000	1179000	As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,
1179000	1181000	but remember that it's both possible
1181000	1183000	and even necessary
1183000	1185000	to simultaneously enjoy media
1185000	1187000	while also being critical of its more problematic
1187000	1189000	or pernicious aspects.
1189000	1191000	So what about the enjoyment part?
1191000	1192000	Surely you wouldn't behead a queen
1192000	1194000	just for liking shiny thing.
1194000	1196000	Is there no room for art for art's sake?
1196000	1199000	The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,
1199000	1202000	the fine Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport-Kunt,
1202000	1205000	said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,
1205000	1208000	that is, completely free of any material desire.
1208000	1211000	Of course, Ms. Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement,
1211000	1214000	so I don't know how seriously you want to take that.
1214000	1215000	But it's actually kind of similar
1215000	1217000	to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,
1217000	1219000	that it merely begins with a desire
1219000	1220000	for the bodies of beautiful boys,
1220000	1222000	which is really just a shadow of our true longing
1222000	1224000	for the concept of beauty itself.
1224000	1227000	God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy
1227000	1228000	is just a bunch of repressed homos
1228000	1231000	trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.
1231000	1232000	What must that be like?
1232000	1233000	From the bottom of my motherfucking
1233000	1234000	and my fatherfucking heart,
1234000	1236000	that must be super fucking hard for them,
1236000	1238000	I can't even imagine.
1238000	1240000	I mean, it makes sense, really.
1240000	1241000	Straight men don't have these problems.
1241000	1244000	They got away with painting softcore for 500 years
1244000	1245000	and never had to think about it.
1245000	1247000	I guess Nietzsche's the exception.
1247000	1249000	He was straight and a philosopher,
1249000	1251000	but he was an incel and, let's be honest,
1251000	1253000	definitely a tranny chaser.
1253000	1256000	The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history
1256000	1259000	is the respectable English gentleman Oscar Wilde.
1259000	1260000	According to Wilde,
1260000	1264000	Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things
1264000	1266000	are corrupt without being charming.
1266000	1267000	This is a fault.
1267000	1271000	Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things
1271000	1272000	are the cultivated.
1272000	1274000	For these, there is hope.
1274000	1277000	They are the elect to whom beautiful things
1277000	1279000	mean only beauty.
1279000	1280000	Spoken like a poet,
1280000	1282000	you want to be cultivated, don't you?
1282000	1284000	Don't you think I'm beautiful?
1284000	1285000	Look, I'll play it your way.
1285000	1286000	Let's swing back to the other side
1286000	1288000	of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.
1290000	1292000	As sentimental as I personally am
1292000	1294000	about art for art's sake and all of that,
1294000	1297000	but from a strictly sociological perspective,
1297000	1298000	I have to admit,
1298000	1301000	taste is pretty intimately related to power.
1301000	1302000	When you go to a museum,
1302000	1304000	you look at various objects on pedestals
1304000	1307000	under special lighting that makes them appear magical.
1307000	1309000	Now that's also what you do at Bed Bath & Beyond,
1309000	1311000	but the difference is that at the museum,
1311000	1313000	you can't buy anything.
1314000	1317000	And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.
1317000	1319000	In the retail context of commodity fetishism,
1319000	1323000	you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.
1323000	1325000	Whereas in the museum,
1325000	1327000	because you can't buy anything,
1327000	1330000	you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,
1330000	1333000	that you're simply enjoying out-of-context objects.
1333000	1335000	But of course, that's an illusion.
1335000	1337000	The museum is the context,
1337000	1338000	and the context is telling you
1338000	1341000	that the things you're looking at are art.
1341000	1343000	And whoever decides what's in the museum
1343000	1345000	decides what good taste is,
1345000	1346000	what's beautiful,
1346000	1347000	what's valuable.
1347000	1350000	Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.
1350000	1354000	Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,
1354000	1356000	conferring upon themselves the status
1356000	1358000	and the cultural grandeur of the art.
1358000	1360000	But it's not just a flex.
1360000	1362000	It means something more than that
1362000	1363000	because of the racial disparity
1363000	1365000	between the performers and the setting.
1365000	1367000	Black people and black art
1367000	1370000	are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre,
1370000	1372000	so seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,
1372000	1375000	with black dancers even overshadowing
1375000	1376000	canonical European art,
1376000	1378000	it's like a full moment.
1378000	1380000	A lot of people have a deep longing
1380000	1383000	for the sense of dignity and grandeur
1383000	1384000	conferred by classical art.
1384000	1387000	That's why trans women love that picture
1387000	1389000	someone photoshopped of the Three Graces,
1389000	1390000	but with dicks.
1390000	1392000	I'll admit that silly picture
1392000	1394000	actually had an emotional effect on me
1394000	1396000	because here in the West,
1396000	1399000	it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful
1399000	1401000	until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.
1401000	1403000	Oh, speaking of which,
1403000	1405000	white marble is a lie.
1405000	1407000	For most of art history history,
1407000	1409000	scholars have insisted
1409000	1411000	that the iconic ghostly whiteness
1411000	1413000	of classical statues
1413000	1415000	was the distinguishing feature of Western sculpture,
1415000	1417000	proof of the elegant taste
1417000	1419000	of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
1419000	1421000	In reality, of course, it turns out
1421000	1422000	they were painted the colors of something
1422000	1424000	a drag queen might wear to a quinceañera.
1424000	1426000	Scholars had been noticing paint remnants
1426000	1428000	on these statues for hundreds of years,
1428000	1430000	but were totally in denial about it
1430000	1432000	because the pure whiteness of these figures
1432000	1434000	was like a sacred dogma.
1434000	1436000	Margaret Talbot in The New Yorker
1436000	1438000	attributes the dogma in part to
1438000	1440000	a tendency to equate whiteness
1440000	1443000	with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,
1443000	1447000	and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.
1447000	1448000	Garish.
1448000	1451000	In 2008, Fabio Beri, an art historian
1451000	1453000	who is now at Stanford,
1453000	1455000	complained that a boldly colored
1455000	1458000	recreation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus
1458000	1460000	at the Vatican Museum
1460000	1463000	looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.
1464000	1465000	Hey, how are you?
1465000	1468000	And you just know that when the news first broke,
1468000	1470000	some horrified WASP classicists
1470000	1472000	turned to a colleague and said,
1472000	1474000	Oh, Kingsley, it looks,
1474000	1476000	it looks Mexican.
1476000	1481000	In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,
1481000	1483000	some art historians have been harassed
1483000	1484000	by the alt-right,
1484000	1486000	who don't take kindly to anyone
1486000	1489000	questioning their white supremacist myths about antiquity.
1489000	1491000	There's some pretty insidious, uh,
1491000	1493000	identitarian prejudices here
1493000	1496000	hiding out under the cloak of taste.
1496000	1499000	Good taste for upper- and middle-class white people
1499000	1501000	generally includes a reflexive disdain
1501000	1503000	for anything a little bit too...
1504000	1505000	colorful.
1505000	1508000	It's these classes that constantly use the words
1508000	1511000	gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.
1511000	1513000	Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,
1513000	1515000	the History of Leopard Print,
1515000	1516000	observes that
1516000	1518000	Tacky, as a concept,
1518000	1520000	refers to the lack of cultivation
1520000	1521000	or the resistance to taste,
1521000	1523000	and more often than not,
1523000	1526000	refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.
1526000	1528000	Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine,
1528000	1531000	ethnic, queer, deviant,
1531000	1533000	not manly, not practical,
1533000	1535000	not businesslike, not serious.
1535000	1537000	Aesthetic excess,
1537000	1540000	particularly of colors, patterns, and bling,
1540000	1544000	is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.
1544000	1547000	Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,
1547000	1548000	where the heart is,
1548000	1549000	where the soul is,
1549000	1551000	and where the fun is.
1551000	1552000	Well that's good news,
1552000	1554000	because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.
1554000	1556000	I can't imagine why.
1556000	1558000	Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.
1558000	1559000	Or camp.
1559000	1560000	People call me camp,
1560000	1563000	and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.
1563000	1566000	I suppose it depends on what camp means.
1566000	1568000	Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala,
1568000	1571000	and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite intellectuals
1571000	1572000	competing to outwit each other
1572000	1575000	with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.
1575000	1578000	What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.
1578000	1580000	The first I'll call coward camp,
1580000	1584000	this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.
1584000	1587000	I have no respect for this whatsoever.
1587000	1591000	This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.
1591000	1593000	You think you're safe from criticism
1593000	1595000	because your look is bad on purpose.
1595000	1596000	Fuck that.
1596000	1598000	Take a stand, you pussy bitch.
1598000	1600000	I take great offense to this
1600000	1602000	as a person whose look is bad on accident,
1602000	1604000	and Susan Sontag agrees with me.
1604000	1607000	In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between
1607000	1609000	naive and deliberate camp.
1609000	1611000	Pure camp is always naive.
1611000	1614000	Camp which knows itself to be camp,
1614000	1617000	or camping, is usually less satisfying.
1617000	1620000	Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,
1620000	1624000	a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control
1624000	1626000	and enters into absurd territory.
1626000	1628000	Hey, how are you?
1628000	1630000	I don't know, my philosophy of style
1630000	1632000	is that people should wear what looks good to them.
1632000	1635000	I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.
1635000	1637000	I think my aesthetic is good.
1637000	1639000	This is what looks good to me,
1639000	1642000	though I'm aware other people might judge it.
1642000	1644000	I like what John Waters said about there being
1644000	1646000	good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1646000	1649000	One must remember, there is such a thing as
1649000	1652000	good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1652000	1656000	To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.
1656000	1658000	I've wondered for a long time
1658000	1661000	why I'm so attracted to bad taste.
1661000	1665000	Like, I technically have the education to know better.
1665000	1669000	I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.
1669000	1671000	Why am I so tacky?
1671000	1673000	I think it's because I'm a transsexual,
1673000	1675000	which lowers you at least a class.
1675000	1678000	If you were born upper class and you're transsexual,
1678000	1680000	you're middle class now, bitch.
1680000	1682000	If you were born middle class and you're transsexual,
1682000	1684000	you are now lower class.
1684000	1687000	And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual,
1687000	1691000	ooh, sweaty, you'd better start a revolution.
1691000	1693000	Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey how are you?
1693000	1695000	Chicks with bread.
1700000	1703000	Trans women have a special relationship with glamour,
1703000	1706000	at least those of us who came of age in the 1960s.
1706000	1708000	In the most basic everyday sense,
1708000	1710000	glam is a way of styling yourself.
1710000	1713000	It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup,
1713000	1715000	it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,
1715000	1717000	it's posing like a fashion model.
1717000	1719000	But originally the word glamour comes from
1719000	1723000	the Scottish word grammary, meaning magic or enchantment.
1723000	1726000	And glamour still involves a kind of illusion,
1726000	1728000	or charm, cast on a spectator.
1728000	1730000	The connection between glamour and opulence
1730000	1732000	is explored in the 2004 essay
1732000	1734000	Viva Me Glam?
1734000	1736000	Is Transgenderism a Critique of,
1737000	1739000	Opulence-Driven Glamour Models,
1739000	1741000	by transgender writer and underground house music producer
1741000	1744000	Terry Temlitz, aka DJ Sprinkles.
1744000	1746000	Sprinkles writes,
1767000	1769000	Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour,
1769000	1771000	or grammary, that was associated with
1771000	1774000	witchcraft, paganism, and sexual deviancy.
1774000	1776000	But in our capitalist society,
1776000	1778000	glamour is a spell of opulence,
1778000	1782000	conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life.
1782000	1784000	For example, a lot of dry queens practice
1784000	1787000	this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities,
1787000	1789000	thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses,
1789000	1792000	pop stars, and models secondhand.
1792000	1794000	Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of
1794000	1796000	secondhand glamour acquires its power
1796000	1799000	from unquestioned social hierarchies.
1799000	1801000	Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded
1801000	1803000	political form because it is about
1803000	1807000	social distance, not social integration.
1807000	1809000	The promise of the pop glam diva is not
1809000	1811000	the promise of social transformation,
1811000	1813000	but individual transformation,
1813000	1817000	in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.
1817000	1820000	It is the promise of an individual's class mobility,
1820000	1823000	not social betterment or class critique.
1823000	1827000	It is, by and large, the American Dream.
1827000	1829000	Now I have to admit, this is a version
1829000	1831000	of the American Dream that hits
1831000	1832000	pretty close to home for me.
1832000	1834000	The overarching plotline of my whole
1834000	1836000	entire YouTube gender journey is that
1836000	1838000	I used to be a tragic mess.
1838000	1840000	And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started
1840000	1842000	this channel I was a broke, gender dysphoric,
1842000	1845000	alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.
1845000	1847000	I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos
1847000	1850000	are still too painful for me to even glance at.
1850000	1853000	And now, I mean look at me, look how far I've come.
1853000	1855000	I look like a moderately talented female impersonator,
1855000	1856000	hey how are you?
1856000	1858000	Those first several months of transition though,
1858000	1860000	they were rough.
1860000	1862000	I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.
1862000	1864000	I used to get laughed out of restaurants.
1864000	1866000	And I was so proud that I wouldn't let
1866000	1868000	anyone see how much that stuff hurt me.
1868000	1870000	You know, I would say,
1870000	1872000	well fuck them, I know I'm great.
1872000	1876000	And then I'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car.
1876000	1878000	And I was a YouTuber that whole time too,
1878000	1882000	which, I mean the cyberbullying alone,
1882000	1884000	I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it
1884000	1886000	if you haven't been in that situation.
1886000	1889000	You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice,
1889000	1891000	picking apart your face and body,
1891000	1893000	clocking your clothes and makeup,
1893000	1895000	digging up your past, trying to deduce
1895000	1897000	the nature of your sexual pathology
1897000	1899000	from the shape of your skull.
1899000	1903000	A lot of it's hilarious to me now,
1903000	1906000	but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.
1906000	1909000	But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up
1909000	1911000	like it was the cure for cancer,
1911000	1913000	like my life depended on it,
1913000	1915000	which is basically how it felt.
1915000	1919000	Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as,
1919000	1921000	as one tweeter put it,
1921000	1923000	cripplingly obsessed with passing.
1923000	1926000	And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me,
1926000	1930000	but glam, to me, is not about passing.
1930000	1932000	I think I actually pass better in no makeup
1932000	1934000	than I do in eyeshadow out to here.
1934000	1936000	You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here,
1936000	1938000	and people think she's just really into makeup
1938000	1940000	or Instagram or cosplay or something,
1940000	1943000	but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,
1943000	1948000	which serves to call more attention to my situation.
1948000	1950000	But on YouTube, I mean,
1950000	1953000	clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.
1953000	1955000	Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway,
1955000	1956000	so what's the point?
1956000	1958000	I would describe this presentation
1958000	1960000	as female impersonator,
1960000	1962000	and that's basically what I am,
1962000	1965000	a female female impersonator.
1965000	1967000	And I present this way because it's fun,
1967000	1969000	I find it artistically fulfilling,
1969000	1971000	and let's be honest, there's part of me
1971000	1973000	that always wanted to be that kind of
1973000	1975000	larger-than-life superwoman.
1975000	1977000	But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.
1977000	1979000	As Sprinkles says,
1980000	1982000	Now, a lot of leftist trans people
1982000	1984000	have grown disillusioned
1984000	1986000	with the individual class mobility
1986000	1988000	represented by glamour,
1988000	1990000	as well as by transition glow-up narratives.
1990000	1992000	And I think that disillusionment
1992000	1994000	and a growing revolutionary sentiment
1994000	1996000	are at the heart of this intense
1996000	1998000	anger and resentment
1998000	2000000	that trans people have for trans women.
2000000	2002000	And I think that's what I'm trying to do
2002000	2004000	with this video,
2004000	2006000	and I'm trying to make it
2006000	2008000	are at the heart of this intense anger
2008000	2010000	and resentment I've noticed
2010000	2012000	a lot of trans women have for drag queens,
2012000	2014000	for glamorous trans Instagram models,
2014000	2016000	and let's be honest,
2016000	2018000	for me.
2018000	2020000	Here's Sprinkles one more time.
2020000	2022000	As long as an MTF's public acceptance
2022000	2024000	is gauged by her ability to emulate
2024000	2026000	glamorous body and style requirements
2026000	2028000	that elude most, quote,
2028000	2030000	real women, then I'll have to ask you
2030000	2032000	to pardon this transgendered writer
2032000	2034000	for not feeling represented
2034000	2036000	by RuPaul any more
2036000	2038000	than my mother feels represented
2038000	2040000	by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.
2040000	2042000	A lot of trans women
2042000	2044000	are basically fed up with having to
2044000	2046000	serve the world of fantasy all the time.
2046000	2048000	They want to be seen for who they are
2048000	2050000	without doing any of that shit.
2050000	2052000	They're fed up with glamour.
2052000	2054000	They're fed up with realness.
2054000	2056000	They're fed up with RuPaul.
2056000	2058000	And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.
2058000	2060000	And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.
2060000	2062000	Six. Envy.
2062000	2064000	The Marxist art critic John Berger
2064000	2066000	called glamour the happiness
2066000	2068000	of being envied.
2068000	2070000	Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.
2070000	2072000	It depends precisely
2072000	2074000	upon not sharing your experiences
2074000	2076000	with those who envy you.
2076000	2078000	But being envied is a form of happiness
2078000	2080000	only in the imagination.
2080000	2082000	The actual experience of being envied sucks.
2082000	2084000	This is the risk of opulence.
2084000	2086000	It invites not just
2086000	2088000	enchanted admiration, but also
2088000	2090000	envy. And where envy goes,
2090000	2092000	the guillotine follows.
2092000	2094000	Or at least, vindictive taxation.
2094000	2096000	This is why the experienced
2096000	2098000	rich know to tone down the opulence,
2098000	2100000	build a nice high wall around their properties,
2100000	2102000	and make a lot of high-profile
2102000	2104000	charitable donations.
2104000	2106000	We can call this kind of strategizing
2106000	2108000	the public relations of success.
2108000	2110000	It certainly helps to have a rags-to-riches story,
2110000	2112000	especially if you can make other people
2112000	2114000	feel included in some way in your success.
2114000	2116000	That's part of the appeal
2116000	2118000	of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems
2118000	2120000	to elevate not just a single performer,
2120000	2122000	but an entire underclass.
2122000	2124000	Conversely, being
2124000	2126000	perceived as exclusionary, elitist,
2126000	2128000	or snobbish is gonna cost
2128000	2130000	you big in terms of envy management.
2130000	2132000	YouTube music critic Todd
2132000	2134000	in the Shadows did a review of Ariana
2134000	2136000	Grande's song Seven Rings, in which
2136000	2138000	he basically drags Ariana, who
2138000	2140000	apparently is white, for appropriating
2140000	2142000	a bunch of hip-hop rags-to-riches signifiers
2142000	2144000	without any of the subtext of
2144000	2146000	starting from the bottom. She's not
2146000	2148000	showcasing a triumph over adversity,
2148000	2150000	she's just a white girl who
2150000	2152000	likes stuff. We started
2152000	2154000	from the bottom, now the whole team
2154000	2156000	is fucking here. So in Todd's
2156000	2158000	words, the song is a grotesque, bullying,
2158000	2160000	VIP-only privilege flex
2160000	2162000	of a mean girl shoving her wealth
2162000	2164000	in your face. I actually like that
2164000	2166000	song, but I'm into that sort
2166000	2168000	of thing. Bully me, mommy.
2168000	2170000	Aww! Fellow students,
2170000	2172000	as a case study in the public relations
2172000	2174000	of success and envy management,
2174000	2176000	let us compare and contrast
2176000	2178000	two successful YouTubers,
2178000	2180000	Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.
2180000	2182000	There's enough similarities between them
2182000	2184000	for the differences to be interesting.
2184000	2186000	They're both LGB and or T, they're both
2186000	2188000	white, they're both blonde sometimes,
2188000	2190000	they're both feminine, they're both rich,
2190000	2192000	and they both flaunt their opulent
2192000	2194000	lifestyles. But nonetheless,
2194000	2196000	people basically seem to like
2196000	2198000	Jeffree Star, whereas
2198000	2200000	Gigi, well,
2200000	2202000	I don't want to say people don't like her,
2202000	2204000	but they don't relate to her.
2204000	2206000	The best example of this is her
2206000	2208000	2017 video, I Wear Walmart
2208000	2210000	for a Week, with its gasp-inducing
2210000	2212000	like-to-dislike ratio.
2212000	2214000	Let's analyze what went wrong here.
2214000	2216000	So, for today's video, I thought
2216000	2218000	we would take it to a place I've
2218000	2220000	never been, Walmart. So that's a bad
2220000	2222000	start, Gorge. Most Americans
2222000	2224000	have been to Walmart. Never having
2224000	2226000	been marks your upbringing as upper-middle
2226000	2228000	class, at least.
2228000	2230000	Treating going to Walmart as some kind of
2230000	2232000	challenge kind of comes across as you
2232000	2234000	and your rich friends being like,
2234000	2236000	what if we pretend to be poor for a day?
2236000	2238000	I wonder if we're gonna see any people at Walmart,
2238000	2240000	you know that website? Babies crying,
2240000	2242000	the trauma. Gigi,
2242000	2244000	no! You need to turn the shade down,
2244000	2246000	like, 20 notches, Gorge.
2246000	2248000	I keep taking my shin on this cart,
2248000	2250000	I'm literally gonna have bruises.
2250000	2252000	Can someone remake these carts,
2252000	2254000	please? It's dangerous.
2254000	2256000	They're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.
2261000	2263000	What should we get next?
2263000	2265000	Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?
2265000	2266000	Do they sell gowns here?
2266000	2268000	This, to me, is peak Gigi,
2268000	2270000	strolling down the aisles of Walmart
2270000	2272000	with a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew
2272000	2274000	that she's plucked from the shelves,
2274000	2276000	saying, I need something for a red
2276000	2278000	carpet. Do they have gowns here?
2278000	2280000	This, to me,
2280000	2282000	is an iconic fashion moment.
2282000	2284000	This is naive camp. This is everything.
2284000	2286000	The idea that she has privileges that
2286000	2288000	other people don't has never
2288000	2290000	once crossed her mind, and that is a
2290000	2292000	very special, precious
2292000	2294000	thing that I want to cherish.
2294000	2296000	Personally, I have no choice but to stan.
2296000	2298000	The YouTube comments section, however,
2298000	2300000	is not as amused as I am,
2300000	2302000	nor as forgiving.
2302000	2304000	This is the second time I've done a close reading of a
2304000	2306000	Gigi video. It's getting kinda weird.
2306000	2308000	Also, why hasn't she answered my letters?
2308000	2310000	Step on my throat, mommy.
2310000	2312000	Now let's look at Jeffree Star. Jeffree does
2312000	2314000	similar kinds of videos to Gigi.
2314000	2316000	He's even done his own video wearing Walmart
2316000	2318000	today, which people loved.
2318000	2320000	Now my first impulse when explaining the differences
2320000	2322000	in public perception is to scream
2322000	2324000	SEXISM. And there's maybe a little
2324000	2326000	of that going on. I do think a rich
2326000	2328000	woman is more irritating to people than
2328000	2330000	a rich man, but there's clearly more than that
2330000	2332000	going on here. Jeffree's fans are,
2332000	2334000	I assume mostly women, and
2334000	2336000	not rich women, regular women.
2336000	2338000	The women who work at the dollar store love him.
2338000	2340000	I'm like your biggest fan.
2340000	2342000	Ordinary people actually enjoy watching
2342000	2344000	Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of
2344000	2346000	designer bags and clothes because they either
2346000	2348000	live vicariously through him or they see
2348000	2350000	him as aspirational. It's the same
2350000	2352000	reason why poor people have always enjoyed
2352000	2354000	watching reality TV shows about
2354000	2356000	the extremely wealthy. The centerpiece
2356000	2358000	of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's
2358000	2360000	self-made. He represents himself
2360000	2362000	as having started from the bottom.
2362000	2364000	You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing
2364000	2366000	and just generally seems
2366000	2368000	like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head.
2368000	2370000	A good example of this is his private
2370000	2372000	jet Burger King mukbang.
2372000	2374000	Now at first you might think that a private jet
2374000	2376000	is not very relatable, but the Burger King
2376000	2378000	aspect brings it back down to earth.
2378000	2380000	Jeffree seems like he's
2380000	2382000	been to Burger King before.
2382000	2384000	He's able to order fluently, he's even
2384000	2386000	kind of charming to the cashier.
2386000	2388000	He doesn't scoff or pinch his nose
2388000	2390000	at anything. Also, the Gucci
2390000	2392000	barrette. Whereas
2392000	2394000	Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong,
2394000	2396000	I do love Gigi, but
2396000	2398000	I don't know if sis would make it
2398000	2400000	out of Burger King alive.
2400000	2402000	You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class
2402000	2404000	solacism like, I don't know,
2404000	2406000	not understanding the concept
2406000	2408000	of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make
2408000	2410000	an entertaining video, just
2410000	2412000	not a relatable video.
2412000	2414000	You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis
2414000	2416000	from the toilet seat and do a story time about that.
2416000	2418000	That's really when Gigi's at her best.
2418000	2420000	She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's
2420000	2422000	serving real transsexual housewives
2422000	2424000	at Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.
2424000	2426000	So I'm like, I see
2426000	2428000	this white little chiclet in my hand.
2428000	2430000	I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like,
2430000	2432000	OH MY GOD.
2432000	2434000	Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled
2434000	2436000	by the fact that people
2436000	2438000	basically like the rich.
2438000	2440000	Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions
2440000	2442000	and we get irritated by elitist, out-of-touch
2442000	2444000	behavior. But
2444000	2446000	ultimately, we have no choice
2446000	2448000	but to stand. And the people we stand
2448000	2450000	the hardest are people like Jeffree Star,
2450000	2452000	who, in a way, seems like
2452000	2454000	a poor person who just
2454000	2456000	so happens to be very rich.
2456000	2458000	And if inequality increases enough,
2458000	2460000	I suspect the standing will stop.
2460000	2462000	Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend
2462000	2464000	$69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store
2464000	2466000	if what you're doing is
2466000	2468000	fantasizing about what you would buy
2468000	2470000	with that much money. But if you're thinking about
2470000	2472000	how $69,000 could pay off your
2472000	2474000	life-ruining medical debt, or about
2474000	2476000	how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments
2476000	2478000	for your dying wife, this kind of thing
2478000	2480000	will start getting under your skin.
2480000	2482000	And eventually, people
2482000	2484000	will start building guillotines again.
2484000	2486000	In fact, the only way I can imagine
2486000	2488000	a revolution happening in this country
2488000	2490000	is if rich people start behaving
2490000	2492000	as badly as possible.
2492000	2494000	So this isn't your dream job?
2494000	2496000	No. And this is free, right?
2496000	2498000	Whatever you want.
2498000	2500000	Seven. Ruin.
2502000	2504000	Good evening,
2504000	2506000	Gorge. Ever notice how
2506000	2508000	most vampires are like
2508000	2510000	counts or queens or
2510000	2512000	at least rich? I guess
2512000	2514000	some are edgy biker teens, but
2514000	2516000	I don't associate with that trash.
2516000	2518000	Gothic horror really got started
2518000	2520000	as a genre with 18th and 19th
2520000	2522000	century novels, which were usually
2522000	2524000	set in an old, decaying castle
2524000	2526000	or mansion. By the late 19th century,
2526000	2528000	the aristocracy had lost a lot
2528000	2530000	of its relevance as a class,
2530000	2532000	so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula
2532000	2534000	represented a dying
2534000	2536000	world order, and also
2536000	2538000	maybe the metaphorical blood-sucking
2538000	2540000	of commoners by the landed gentry.
2540000	2542000	Vampires were also usually seducers,
2542000	2544000	and the aristocrat seducer
2544000	2546000	trope had actually played an important
2546000	2548000	role in turning public opinion
2548000	2550000	against the nobility. So the
2550000	2552000	gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of
2552000	2554000	dead and decaying opulence.
2554000	2556000	And that aesthetic has evolved over time,
2556000	2558000	from the ruins of a medieval castle
2558000	2560000	to the iconic haunted house,
2560000	2562000	which in American horror is
2562000	2564000	usually a decaying Victorian
2564000	2566000	mansion. It's a trope with an
2566000	2568000	interesting backstory. During the
2568000	2570000	golden age, industrialization produced
2570000	2572000	a new wealthy class of people
2572000	2574000	who built what were essentially 19th
2574000	2576000	century McMansions. When the Great
2576000	2578000	Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian
2578000	2580000	mansions were abandoned and began
2580000	2582000	to decay, which gave them morbid
2582000	2584000	associations that made them perfect
2584000	2586000	for stories about hauntings
2586000	2588000	and psychos
2588000	2590000	and weirdos. So ruined
2590000	2592000	opulence becomes
2592000	2594000	gothic, which kind of makes you think.
2594000	2596000	We live in an age of opulence
2596000	2598000	and inequality and growing
2598000	2600000	irritation with abusive men in power,
2600000	2602000	the middle class is shrinking,
2602000	2604000	social unrest is on the rise,
2604000	2606000	it seems like a new economic
2606000	2608000	order could be on the horizon.
2608000	2610000	When the opulence of our age decays,
2610000	2612000	will there be a new gothic
2612000	2614000	aesthetic of ruined shopping
2614000	2616000	malls? Well, there
2616000	2618000	kind of already is.
2618000	2620000	The urban explorer Dan Bell is a
2620000	2622000	YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series,
2622000	2624000	in which he explores the ruins of
2624000	2626000	abandoned shopping malls. For example,
2626000	2628000	the now demolished Owings Mills
2628000	2630000	Mall just north of Baltimore.
2630000	2632000	The mall opened in 1986
2632000	2634000	as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.
2634000	2636000	Champagne, gold dust, and
2636000	2638000	pink feathers heralded in
2638000	2640000	a new era for Owings Mills.
2640000	2642000	Today's opening of the Owings Mills
2642000	2644000	Fashion Mall does not only mean a new
2644000	2646000	high fashion place to shop, it also
2646000	2648000	means lots of new developments and jobs
2648000	2650000	for Baltimore County. It had a
2650000	2652000	Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth
2652000	2654000	Avenue. It was a big, high-end
2654000	2656000	mall. But in 1992,
2656000	2658000	a woman who worked as a cleaner
2658000	2660000	at Saks was murdered during
2660000	2662000	an armed robbery on the trail between the mall
2662000	2664000	and the Baltimore metro station.
2664000	2666000	After the murder, the mall got a reputation
2666000	2668000	for being unsafe, and
2668000	2670000	slowly the stores closed down.
2670000	2672000	Dan recorded two videos at Owings
2672000	2674000	Mills in 2015, when only
2674000	2676000	five of the original 155
2676000	2678000	stores remained.
2678000	2680000	He takes us through the strangely clean
2680000	2682000	and empty halls, the
2682000	2684000	drained fountains, the
2684000	2686000	gutted food court.
2686000	2688000	Watching these videos seems to provoke
2688000	2690000	an emotional response in a lot of
2690000	2692000	people. Some say they feel
2692000	2694000	nostalgic or sad, some
2694000	2696000	express rage at the waste and futility,
2696000	2698000	some find it creepy or
2698000	2700000	even horrifying, and some
2700000	2702000	have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity
2702000	2704000	of it all. One commenter says,
2704000	2706000	I think it is still hitting people with
2706000	2708000	slow-motion shock that the
2708000	2710000	20th century is really over.
2710000	2712000	In the 80s, this looked
2712000	2714000	like the start of a big new world
2714000	2716000	of wealth for everyone.
2716000	2718000	In fact, it was the last gasp
2718000	2720000	of 20th century general
2720000	2722000	prosperity.
2722000	2724000	I agree with all these comments,
2724000	2726000	and I feel every one of these
2726000	2728000	emotions. I think there is
2728000	2730000	a new aesthetic sensibility
2730000	2732000	emerging here, a gothic
2732000	2734000	aesthetic for the 21st century,
2734000	2736000	this decaying opulence
2736000	2738000	that is the carcass of
2738000	2740000	20th century consumerism.
2740000	2742000	Oh, it gives me a chill!
2742000	2744000	My nape hair stands on end
2744000	2746000	and a tingle goes down my
2746000	2748000	spine.
2748000	2750000	The Owings Mills
2750000	2752000	Mall was totally demolished in
2752000	2754000	late 2016, and Dan's
2754000	2756000	final video about it, we see clips
2756000	2758000	from his earlier Owings Mills videos
2758000	2760000	intercut with absolutely
2760000	2762000	post-apocalyptic footage of the
2762000	2764000	half-demolished ruin.
2764000	2766000	It's not like the feeling of
2766000	2768000	exploring a ruined temple or abbey
2768000	2770000	where you somehow perceive
2770000	2772000	the spiritual significance of the
2772000	2774000	original building. In a dead mall,
2774000	2776000	you do sense the ghosts of
2776000	2778000	the shoppers and the workers,
2778000	2780000	their aspirations and material
2780000	2782000	longings, but
2782000	2784000	what does the crumbling wreckage of a
2784000	2786000	J.C. Penney really mean?
2786000	2788000	That is a question
2788000	2790000	that will haunt me to the grave.
2794000	2796000	Alright comrades,
2796000	2798000	I've said my piece.
2798000	2800000	I'll come quietly. There's no reason
2800000	2802000	to tie me down. I mean,
2802000	2804000	unless you're into that. In which case,
2804000	2806000	by all means. No,
2806000	2808000	I won't resist.
2808000	2810000	I accept my fate.
2824000	2826000	🎵
2826000	2851000	🎵
2852700	2854000	Fuck you, Romano.
2854500	2856500	I'm glad your father died.
2858500	2860500	Let's just get that out there before I just say it.
2860500	2862500	I must be honest, definitely a Chinese chaser.
2867000	2869000	Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny.
2869000	2870500	But he was an incel.
2870500	2872500	And definitely a Chinese chaser.
2874000	2875000	Look at me.
2875000	2876000	I'm ashamed.
2876000	2877500	I'm ashamed of what I've written.
2878500	2879500	Huh?
2880500	2881500	Kant, yeah.
2881500	2883500	But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm...
2883500	2885000	an asshole.
2886000	2889500	I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I
2889500	2892000	shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.
2892000	2894000	How much leg do we want to get in here?
2894500	2896000	A lot, I assume.
2896000	2898000	I'm just getting oil all over my fur.
2898000	2899000	Great.
2899000	2900500	It's not real fur, whatever.
2900500	2903500	Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.
2903500	2904500	Ugh.
2904500	2906000	Moral people.
2906000	2908000	There's one that I can't stand.
2909500	2911500	People who have some sense of decency.
2911500	2912500	Okay.
2912500	2914500	Is a hair light really a good idea?
2914500	2916500	Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?
2916500	2918000	Who invented that?
2918000	2919000	An asshole.
2919000	2921500	What about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?
2921500	2924000	Uh, I guess it was a shitty to be feminist.
2924000	2925500	Ugh, Christ.
2925500	2927500	The demands of these people.
2927500	2929000	These bucky teeth, man.
2931000	2932000	It's like...
2932000	2933500	It's like being catty.
2933500	2935500	Catty, catty.
2935500	2941000	That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.
2943000	2945000	So catty and stupid.
2945000	2947000	Ugh, okay.
