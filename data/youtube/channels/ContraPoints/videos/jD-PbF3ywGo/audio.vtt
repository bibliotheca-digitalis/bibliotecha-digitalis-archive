WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
["Ach, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig, ach, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig ist der Mensch im Himmel"]

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Oh, hey, Quarch. Hey, how are you, Quarch?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Okay, listen. I know this looks bad.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Well, fair enough.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
How about this?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
but first, you have to let me tell you my life story.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Fair? That's super fucking great.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'll start at the beginning.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
where the most exciting attraction for children is the National Museum of Natural History.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
who, might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I liked a good stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
but my real passion was the Gem and Mineral Hall.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Comrades, losers, and haters, I would like to propose

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
begins with absolute pleasure.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, God!

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Northern Virginia is McMansion country,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
and I would get excited by some little detail,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
But then my mom would say,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Look at this ostentatious trash!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
So you learn.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
You learn taste according to the social class of your upbringing.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And with taste comes all this adult baggage,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
snobbery and pretense and conceit.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
I am but a simple queen longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
So, stripey sock catgirls of the heckin' Revolutionary Committee,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
before you pass sentence,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
allow me to make my case gorge.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
One. Success.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh hey, how are you, gorge?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Look, I like stuff.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I like shiny things.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
There's a social context for it.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
It generally means something.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, because he's trying to send a message.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Maybe to the world, maybe to himself.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
He's saying,

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
from the pharaohs of Egypt to the kings of France

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I guess God likes shiny things too.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American Dream.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
In the words of Drake,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
You've made it.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
You're rich, bitch.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Remember in high school when you had to read

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
but he throws them anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
that he's a success, that he's worth something.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And as we all remember, in the end,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to save the Hall of Hrothgar.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
about how the theme of The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I got a D minus.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I like those Balenciagas.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Fuck.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and driving lambs and all that shit,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
but teacher, pick me, pick me.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Let's talk about symbols.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Let's talk about allegory.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's talk about metaphor.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Let's talk about themes.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
to making money moves.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That's the American Dream.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
where that kind of success is really improbable.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
rap music is the reason for the problems with the blacks?

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
For conservatives, the American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And is there any sector of our culture

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated than hip-hop?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It's not just hip-hop, though.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and the Ferraris and the Fendi and the Bugattis

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
and the Armani and the Maseratis.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Which, to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Burn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and replace it with a large-scale figure of Donatello Versace

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
holding a bottle of Cristal.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
than the hypocritical cheese furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
We have standards in this country.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Listen up, America.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
We live in a society.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Not of climbers, but of graspers.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
To paraphrase Ian Danskin,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
maybe anyone can achieve the American dream,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
but everyone cannot.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And the fact of the matter is,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
most people don't.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
unless someone else was poor?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Not other rich people, that's for sure.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So when you live in a society

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
that constantly equates wealth and success,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
but which is also so unequal

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
that most people will never be wealthy,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
well, what's the average person supposed to do?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Two, fantasy.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I wish the world were my gem collection.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I wish I owned everything.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I go to an art museum and it's like,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Monet, Rembrandt,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
okay, that's super fucking great,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
but can I buy it?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Well, no, I can't buy it.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
So what do you do?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, you fake it.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You create an illusion.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't own this building,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and you rube off the streets of Baltimore

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and walk in here, as indeed you did.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
But that's okay. I need a witness.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I need you to see me here

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
among the other art,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
where I belong.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It makes me feel valuable.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
because opulence is not abundance.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
The phrase, opulence, you own everything,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
is at this point, basically a gay internet meme.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Opulence.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Opulence, opulence, opulence, opulence.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
But it originally comes from the documentary

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Paris is Burning,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
about the Harlem ballroom culture in the 1980s,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
where it's proclaimed by MC Jr. LaBeija.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Opulence.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You own everything.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
of luxury and decadence.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
of the queer Black and Latin American participants

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
of the balls,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
A lot of those kids that are in the balls,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
they don't have two of nothing.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Some of them don't even eat.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamor,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
an illusion created by skillful artifice.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Participants walk categories like executive realness,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
with the goal of being indistinguishable

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
from a real executive.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Nowadays every white queer says the word realness,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I mean, whomst among us honestly hasn't

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
slipped into a dissociative fugue state,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
dressed up as a clown,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
kidnapped a few neighborhood children,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
and told the cops,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I did it, officer.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I did the cultural appropriation.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I am a colonizer.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I am part of the problem.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
And I'm sorry.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Take me away, boys.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's crazy.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
That's mega coconuts.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I guess I should explain that American slang works

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
according to what we might call

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
a trickle-up model of linguistics.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
gay and trans people of color.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Then those words trickle up to straight Black people

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
and white gays,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
and then finally white cishets start using them.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
A lot of times the original meaning or context

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
gets lost along the way.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
between what is being emulated and what is absent,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Realness, in that sense,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
is a much more complicated and interesting concept

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
than the generic trans notion of passing.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Passing is just looking like

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
whereas in the ballroom sense,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You're not really an executive,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
but you're looking like an executive,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
and therefore you're showing the straight world

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
that I can be an executive.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
If I had the opportunity, I could be one,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
because I can look like one.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
in 80s ballroom culture, such as the FX drama Pose,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
which is set during the era,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's really important to people in this country

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
to at least sometimes feel like they're living a luxe life,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
even if in fact, they aren't.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
that exploits that need.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
and Caesar's Palace are designed

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
to make you feel like a fancy bitch,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
even though they're actually just high-rise traps

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
designed to lure you in and take your money.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And if there's one thing I can't stand,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
it's traps.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
But the trap works,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
because part of what it is to be American

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I actually love Vegas.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Lindsay Ellis' bachelorette party.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I did once experience the first exciting stages

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
of a gambling habit.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
and had some good luck playing blackjack.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I mean, I wasn't a high roller or anything,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And that was a lot of money to me.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
At the time, I was working a customer service job

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
making $10 an hour,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
so to make $200 in five minutes,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
customer service toil.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Before taxes.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So I went back and I went back,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
but I never got lucky again.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Just absolute shock, despair,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
this deep shame and self-disgust.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
The kind of face that says,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm gonna have to explain to my wife

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
that I spent the kids' college savings

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
on a high-limit slot machine.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And there is nothing opulent about that,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
trying to pay off their hospital bills.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
America, we are a bad country.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Donald Trump is a Vegas man,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
he's pulling this grift on the entire country.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
of the American dream is more enchanting to the imagination

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
but in fact, there are two very different types of magic

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
at work.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
a demonstration of their wealth and power.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
But for the marginalized and impoverished,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
they've been denied.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
serving viper realness.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Three, class.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Hey, how are you?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Hey, how are you?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Hey, how are you?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Hey, how are you?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Hey, how are you?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
People don't understand how difficult it is

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
to be this blonde.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
You know, a biological female that looks like me,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm afraid some transvestite psycho

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
is gonna sneak in through a rear window

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and I'll have to dial M for murder.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
difficult to apply to the present day.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
As a typical modern woman,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
That's praxis.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Whomst?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Who is she?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Where's her summer collection?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That's super fucking great, but can I buy it?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
and a factory worker.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Now, I could be out of touch,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
but personally, I've never met a factory worker,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
or a factory owner for that matter.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
They must all be on a brand trip to China,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
working on the B&P summer collection.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
is that the bougies own the means of production

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
and the proles work for wages.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
What about YouTubers?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Which side of the revolution are we on?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
because if the revolution starts on Twitter,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
my head is definitely going in the basket,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
and then I'll have no choice

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
but to do the conservative talk show circuit.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
You know, like most people

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
whose brains are detached from their bodies.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, A-R-U.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
must be overly simplistic.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
My favorite book about class in America

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
is Paul Fussell's Class,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
A Guide Through the American Status System,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
which describes nine distinct classes.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Fussell is not as concerned

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
with economic relations between classes

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
as he is with status,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Things like education, style, taste,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and attitude towards money.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Now the book was published in 1983,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
but there's an eerie familiarity

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
to a lot of the core observations.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And it's also just pretty funny,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
like his quasi-scientific observation

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
that the higher your social class,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
the smaller the balls in the sports you play,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
or his description of middle-class living rooms.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Your real middle class refuses to show

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
any but the most bland books and magazines

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
on its coffee tables.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Otherwise, expressions of opinion,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
awkward questions, or even ideas might result.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
One of Fussell's core themes

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
is that it's not how much money you have

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
that defines your class,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
so much as how you got your money.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
If you had to work for your money,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
then you're not really upper class.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
The upper class has inherited wealth,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and as a result they're very confident

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
they don't feel the need to prove themselves.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
their position on the ladder.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
But then there's the middle class,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
who are social climbers,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
and who compensate for their insecurities by,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
for example, placing a pretentious collage

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
of university bumper stickers on the back of the family car.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
The higher and lower classes,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
there's some good in them,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
but the middle classes are all affectation

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
and conceit and pretense and concealment.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
by people with something to prove,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
whether it's marginalized ballroom performers

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
proving their worth to themselves

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
or the new rich building McMansions

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
to show off their wealth to others.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
He inherited his wealth,

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
so he should know better than to have golden faucets.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
But he doesn't.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
As Fran Lebowitz said,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
he's a poor person's idea of a rich person.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And that's actually his charm.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's part of his mass appeal.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
So there's actually something kind of relatable,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
about the golden faucets.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
People who have wealth but not class

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
are actually very popular in this country.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
We don't like class here,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
because class is exclusionary.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
we tell ourselves.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
even though in practice, it isn't.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Now the upper-class cultural elite in this country,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
the real classy people,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
are mostly very unlike Trump.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
they embrace the reserved old-money values

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
of aristocratic wasps,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Fussell notes, for instance,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
They like to live at the end of long driveways

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
and houses away from public view.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
They dress down while traveling

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
These are essentially survival skills

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
of the experienced rich.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
If you flaunt your wealth too much,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
people might rob you,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
or they might get envious

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Or worse, taxation.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Old money knows this,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
but new money just cannot resist

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
the temptation to show off.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
is dying out.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
of money over class.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
His presidency validates the idea

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
that you can be as vulgar as you want

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
so long as you have the cash to back it up.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
So the old class system is dying out,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and in its place,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
we have universally adopted the mindset

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
of the nouveau riche.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
If you got it, flaunt it.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
If you haven't got it,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
find a way to flaunt it anyway.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Now I'm sure this is all very tragic

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and disappointing to people of class and taste,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
it's actually fantastic news.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Listen comrades,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I've been pretty down on opulence so far,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and I could continue analyzing it

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
in terms of inequality and class struggle,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
but you already know all that.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's why you came to cut my head off.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
But hold on,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
is that really all there is to aesthetics,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Marxist economic analysis,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
or the SJW version

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
that makes everything about race and gender?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
but remember that it's both possible

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and even necessary

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
to simultaneously enjoy media

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
while also being critical of its more problematic

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
or pernicious aspects.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
So what about the enjoyment part?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Surely you wouldn't behead a queen

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
just for liking shiny thing.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
the fine Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport-Kunt,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
that is, completely free of any material desire.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Of course, Ms. Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
so I don't know how seriously you want to take that.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
But it's actually kind of similar

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
that it merely begins with a desire

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
for the bodies of beautiful boys,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
which is really just a shadow of our true longing

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
for the concept of beauty itself.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
is just a bunch of repressed homos

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
What must that be like?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
From the bottom of my motherfucking

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
and my fatherfucking heart,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
that must be super fucking hard for them,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I can't even imagine.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I mean, it makes sense, really.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Straight men don't have these problems.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
and never had to think about it.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I guess Nietzsche's the exception.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
He was straight and a philosopher,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
but he was an incel and, let's be honest,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
definitely a tranny chaser.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
is the respectable English gentleman Oscar Wilde.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
According to Wilde,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
are corrupt without being charming.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
This is a fault.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
are the cultivated.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
For these, there is hope.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
They are the elect to whom beautiful things

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
mean only beauty.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Spoken like a poet,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
you want to be cultivated, don't you?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Look, I'll play it your way.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Let's swing back to the other side

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
As sentimental as I personally am

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
about art for art's sake and all of that,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
but from a strictly sociological perspective,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I have to admit,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
taste is pretty intimately related to power.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
When you go to a museum,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
you look at various objects on pedestals

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
under special lighting that makes them appear magical.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Now that's also what you do at Bed Bath & Beyond,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
but the difference is that at the museum,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
you can't buy anything.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
In the retail context of commodity fetishism,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Whereas in the museum,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
because you can't buy anything,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
that you're simply enjoying out-of-context objects.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
But of course, that's an illusion.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
The museum is the context,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
and the context is telling you

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
that the things you're looking at are art.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And whoever decides what's in the museum

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
decides what good taste is,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
what's beautiful,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
what's valuable.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
conferring upon themselves the status

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
and the cultural grandeur of the art.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
But it's not just a flex.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It means something more than that

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
because of the racial disparity

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
between the performers and the setting.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Black people and black art

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
so seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
with black dancers even overshadowing

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
canonical European art,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
it's like a full moment.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
A lot of people have a deep longing

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
for the sense of dignity and grandeur

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
conferred by classical art.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
That's why trans women love that picture

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
someone photoshopped of the Three Graces,

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
but with dicks.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I'll admit that silly picture

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
actually had an emotional effect on me

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
because here in the West,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Oh, speaking of which,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
white marble is a lie.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
For most of art history history,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
scholars have insisted

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
that the iconic ghostly whiteness

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
of classical statues

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
was the distinguishing feature of Western sculpture,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
proof of the elegant taste

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
In reality, of course, it turns out

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
they were painted the colors of something

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
a drag queen might wear to a quinceañera.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
on these statues for hundreds of years,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
but were totally in denial about it

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
because the pure whiteness of these figures

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
was like a sacred dogma.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Margaret Talbot in The New Yorker

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
attributes the dogma in part to

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
a tendency to equate whiteness

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Garish.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
In 2008, Fabio Beri, an art historian

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
who is now at Stanford,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
complained that a boldly colored

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
recreation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
at the Vatican Museum

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Hey, how are you?

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And you just know that when the news first broke,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
some horrified WASP classicists

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
turned to a colleague and said,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, Kingsley, it looks,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
it looks Mexican.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
some art historians have been harassed

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
by the alt-right,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
who don't take kindly to anyone

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
questioning their white supremacist myths about antiquity.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
There's some pretty insidious, uh,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
identitarian prejudices here

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
hiding out under the cloak of taste.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
Good taste for upper- and middle-class white people

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
generally includes a reflexive disdain

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
for anything a little bit too...

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
colorful.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
It's these classes that constantly use the words

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
the History of Leopard Print,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
observes that

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Tacky, as a concept,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
refers to the lack of cultivation

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
or the resistance to taste,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
and more often than not,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine,

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
ethnic, queer, deviant,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
not manly, not practical,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
not businesslike, not serious.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Aesthetic excess,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
particularly of colors, patterns, and bling,

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
where the heart is,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
where the soul is,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
and where the fun is.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Well that's good news,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I can't imagine why.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Or camp.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
People call me camp,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite intellectuals

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
competing to outwit each other

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The first I'll call coward camp,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
You think you're safe from criticism

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
because your look is bad on purpose.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Fuck that.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Take a stand, you pussy bitch.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I take great offense to this

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
as a person whose look is bad on accident,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and Susan Sontag agrees with me.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
naive and deliberate camp.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Pure camp is always naive.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Camp which knows itself to be camp,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
or camping, is usually less satisfying.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and enters into absurd territory.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Hey, how are you?

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I don't know, my philosophy of style

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
is that people should wear what looks good to them.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I think my aesthetic is good.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
This is what looks good to me,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
though I'm aware other people might judge it.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I like what John Waters said about there being

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
One must remember, there is such a thing as

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I've wondered for a long time

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Why am I so tacky?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I think it's because I'm a transsexual,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
which lowers you at least a class.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
you're middle class now, bitch.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
you are now lower class.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual,

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
ooh, sweaty, you'd better start a revolution.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey how are you?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Chicks with bread.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
at least those of us who came of age in the 1960s.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
In the most basic everyday sense,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
glam is a way of styling yourself.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
it's posing like a fashion model.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
But originally the word glamour comes from

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
the Scottish word grammary, meaning magic or enchantment.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
And glamour still involves a kind of illusion,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
or charm, cast on a spectator.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
The connection between glamour and opulence

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
is explored in the 2004 essay

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Viva Me Glam?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Is Transgenderism a Critique of,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Opulence-Driven Glamour Models,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
by transgender writer and underground house music producer

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Terry Temlitz, aka DJ Sprinkles.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Sprinkles writes,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
or grammary, that was associated with

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
witchcraft, paganism, and sexual deviancy.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
But in our capitalist society,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
glamour is a spell of opulence,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
For example, a lot of dry queens practice

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses,

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
pop stars, and models secondhand.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
secondhand glamour acquires its power

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
from unquestioned social hierarchies.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
political form because it is about

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
social distance, not social integration.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
The promise of the pop glam diva is not

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the promise of social transformation,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
but individual transformation,

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
It is the promise of an individual's class mobility,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
not social betterment or class critique.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
It is, by and large, the American Dream.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Now I have to admit, this is a version

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
of the American Dream that hits

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
pretty close to home for me.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
The overarching plotline of my whole

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
entire YouTube gender journey is that

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I used to be a tragic mess.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
this channel I was a broke, gender dysphoric,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
are still too painful for me to even glance at.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
And now, I mean look at me, look how far I've come.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I look like a moderately talented female impersonator,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
hey how are you?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Those first several months of transition though,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
they were rough.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I used to get laughed out of restaurants.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And I was so proud that I wouldn't let

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
anyone see how much that stuff hurt me.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
You know, I would say,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
well fuck them, I know I'm great.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
And then I'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And I was a YouTuber that whole time too,

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
which, I mean the cyberbullying alone,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
if you haven't been in that situation.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
picking apart your face and body,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
clocking your clothes and makeup,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
digging up your past, trying to deduce

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
the nature of your sexual pathology

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
from the shape of your skull.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
A lot of it's hilarious to me now,

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
like it was the cure for cancer,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
like my life depended on it,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
which is basically how it felt.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
as one tweeter put it,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
cripplingly obsessed with passing.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me,

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
but glam, to me, is not about passing.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I think I actually pass better in no makeup

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
than I do in eyeshadow out to here.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and people think she's just really into makeup

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
or Instagram or cosplay or something,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
which serves to call more attention to my situation.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But on YouTube, I mean,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
so what's the point?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I would describe this presentation

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
as female impersonator,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and that's basically what I am,

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
a female female impersonator.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And I present this way because it's fun,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I find it artistically fulfilling,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
and let's be honest, there's part of me

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
that always wanted to be that kind of

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
larger-than-life superwoman.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
As Sprinkles says,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Now, a lot of leftist trans people

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
have grown disillusioned

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
with the individual class mobility

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
represented by glamour,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
as well as by transition glow-up narratives.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
And I think that disillusionment

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and a growing revolutionary sentiment

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
are at the heart of this intense

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
anger and resentment

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
that trans people have for trans women.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And I think that's what I'm trying to do

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
with this video,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
and I'm trying to make it

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
are at the heart of this intense anger

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and resentment I've noticed

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
a lot of trans women have for drag queens,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
for glamorous trans Instagram models,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
and let's be honest,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
for me.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Here's Sprinkles one more time.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
As long as an MTF's public acceptance

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
is gauged by her ability to emulate

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
glamorous body and style requirements

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that elude most, quote,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
real women, then I'll have to ask you

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
to pardon this transgendered writer

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
for not feeling represented

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
by RuPaul any more

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
than my mother feels represented

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
A lot of trans women

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
are basically fed up with having to

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
serve the world of fantasy all the time.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
They want to be seen for who they are

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
without doing any of that shit.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
They're fed up with glamour.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
They're fed up with realness.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
They're fed up with RuPaul.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Six. Envy.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The Marxist art critic John Berger

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
called glamour the happiness

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
of being envied.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
It depends precisely

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
upon not sharing your experiences

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
with those who envy you.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
But being envied is a form of happiness

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
only in the imagination.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The actual experience of being envied sucks.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
This is the risk of opulence.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It invites not just

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
enchanted admiration, but also

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
envy. And where envy goes,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
the guillotine follows.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Or at least, vindictive taxation.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
This is why the experienced

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
rich know to tone down the opulence,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
build a nice high wall around their properties,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
and make a lot of high-profile

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
charitable donations.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
We can call this kind of strategizing

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
the public relations of success.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It certainly helps to have a rags-to-riches story,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
especially if you can make other people

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
feel included in some way in your success.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's part of the appeal

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
to elevate not just a single performer,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
but an entire underclass.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Conversely, being

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
perceived as exclusionary, elitist,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
or snobbish is gonna cost

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
you big in terms of envy management.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
YouTube music critic Todd

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in the Shadows did a review of Ariana

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Grande's song Seven Rings, in which

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
he basically drags Ariana, who

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
apparently is white, for appropriating

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
a bunch of hip-hop rags-to-riches signifiers

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
without any of the subtext of

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
starting from the bottom. She's not

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
showcasing a triumph over adversity,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
she's just a white girl who

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
likes stuff. We started

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
from the bottom, now the whole team

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
is fucking here. So in Todd's

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
words, the song is a grotesque, bullying,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
VIP-only privilege flex

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
of a mean girl shoving her wealth

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
in your face. I actually like that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
song, but I'm into that sort

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
of thing. Bully me, mommy.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Aww! Fellow students,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
as a case study in the public relations

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
of success and envy management,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
let us compare and contrast

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
two successful YouTubers,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
There's enough similarities between them

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
for the differences to be interesting.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
They're both LGB and or T, they're both

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
white, they're both blonde sometimes,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
they're both feminine, they're both rich,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and they both flaunt their opulent

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
lifestyles. But nonetheless,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
people basically seem to like

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Jeffree Star, whereas

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Gigi, well,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I don't want to say people don't like her,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
but they don't relate to her.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
The best example of this is her

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
2017 video, I Wear Walmart

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
for a Week, with its gasp-inducing

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
like-to-dislike ratio.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Let's analyze what went wrong here.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
So, for today's video, I thought

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
we would take it to a place I've

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
never been, Walmart. So that's a bad

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
start, Gorge. Most Americans

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
have been to Walmart. Never having

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
been marks your upbringing as upper-middle

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
class, at least.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Treating going to Walmart as some kind of

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
challenge kind of comes across as you

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
and your rich friends being like,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
what if we pretend to be poor for a day?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I wonder if we're gonna see any people at Walmart,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
you know that website? Babies crying,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
the trauma. Gigi,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
no! You need to turn the shade down,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
like, 20 notches, Gorge.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I keep taking my shin on this cart,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I'm literally gonna have bruises.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Can someone remake these carts,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
please? It's dangerous.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
They're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
What should we get next?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Do they sell gowns here?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
This, to me, is peak Gigi,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
strolling down the aisles of Walmart

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
with a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
that she's plucked from the shelves,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
saying, I need something for a red

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
carpet. Do they have gowns here?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
This, to me,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
is an iconic fashion moment.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
This is naive camp. This is everything.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
The idea that she has privileges that

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
other people don't has never

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
once crossed her mind, and that is a

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
very special, precious

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
thing that I want to cherish.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Personally, I have no choice but to stan.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
The YouTube comments section, however,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
is not as amused as I am,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
nor as forgiving.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
This is the second time I've done a close reading of a

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Gigi video. It's getting kinda weird.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Also, why hasn't she answered my letters?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Step on my throat, mommy.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Now let's look at Jeffree Star. Jeffree does

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
similar kinds of videos to Gigi.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
He's even done his own video wearing Walmart

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
today, which people loved.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Now my first impulse when explaining the differences

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
in public perception is to scream

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
SEXISM. And there's maybe a little

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
of that going on. I do think a rich

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
woman is more irritating to people than

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
a rich man, but there's clearly more than that

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
going on here. Jeffree's fans are,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I assume mostly women, and

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
not rich women, regular women.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
The women who work at the dollar store love him.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I'm like your biggest fan.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
designer bags and clothes because they either

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
live vicariously through him or they see

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
him as aspirational. It's the same

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
reason why poor people have always enjoyed

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
watching reality TV shows about

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
the extremely wealthy. The centerpiece

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
self-made. He represents himself

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
as having started from the bottom.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and just generally seems

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
A good example of this is his private

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
jet Burger King mukbang.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Now at first you might think that a private jet

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
is not very relatable, but the Burger King

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
aspect brings it back down to earth.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Jeffree seems like he's

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
been to Burger King before.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
He's able to order fluently, he's even

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
kind of charming to the cashier.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
He doesn't scoff or pinch his nose

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
at anything. Also, the Gucci

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
barrette. Whereas

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I do love Gigi, but

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I don't know if sis would make it

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
out of Burger King alive.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
solacism like, I don't know,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
not understanding the concept

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
an entertaining video, just

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
not a relatable video.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
from the toilet seat and do a story time about that.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
That's really when Gigi's at her best.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
serving real transsexual housewives

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
at Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
So I'm like, I see

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
this white little chiclet in my hand.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
OH MY GOD.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
by the fact that people

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
basically like the rich.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and we get irritated by elitist, out-of-touch

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
behavior. But

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
ultimately, we have no choice

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
but to stand. And the people we stand

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the hardest are people like Jeffree Star,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
who, in a way, seems like

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
a poor person who just

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
so happens to be very rich.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And if inequality increases enough,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I suspect the standing will stop.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
$69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
if what you're doing is

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
fantasizing about what you would buy

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
with that much money. But if you're thinking about

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
how $69,000 could pay off your

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
life-ruining medical debt, or about

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
for your dying wife, this kind of thing

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
will start getting under your skin.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
And eventually, people

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
will start building guillotines again.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
In fact, the only way I can imagine

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
a revolution happening in this country

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
is if rich people start behaving

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
as badly as possible.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
So this isn't your dream job?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
No. And this is free, right?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Whatever you want.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Seven. Ruin.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Good evening,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Gorge. Ever notice how

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
most vampires are like

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
counts or queens or

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
at least rich? I guess

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
some are edgy biker teens, but

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I don't associate with that trash.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Gothic horror really got started

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
as a genre with 18th and 19th

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
century novels, which were usually

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
set in an old, decaying castle

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
or mansion. By the late 19th century,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
the aristocracy had lost a lot

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
of its relevance as a class,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
represented a dying

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
world order, and also

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
maybe the metaphorical blood-sucking

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
of commoners by the landed gentry.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Vampires were also usually seducers,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and the aristocrat seducer

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
trope had actually played an important

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
role in turning public opinion

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
against the nobility. So the

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
dead and decaying opulence.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And that aesthetic has evolved over time,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
from the ruins of a medieval castle

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
to the iconic haunted house,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
which in American horror is

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
usually a decaying Victorian

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
mansion. It's a trope with an

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
interesting backstory. During the

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
golden age, industrialization produced

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
a new wealthy class of people

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
who built what were essentially 19th

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
century McMansions. When the Great

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
mansions were abandoned and began

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
to decay, which gave them morbid

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
associations that made them perfect

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
for stories about hauntings

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and psychos

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and weirdos. So ruined

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
opulence becomes

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
gothic, which kind of makes you think.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We live in an age of opulence

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and inequality and growing

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
irritation with abusive men in power,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
the middle class is shrinking,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
social unrest is on the rise,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
it seems like a new economic

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
order could be on the horizon.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
When the opulence of our age decays,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
will there be a new gothic

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
aesthetic of ruined shopping

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
malls? Well, there

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
kind of already is.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
in which he explores the ruins of

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
abandoned shopping malls. For example,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
the now demolished Owings Mills

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Mall just north of Baltimore.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
The mall opened in 1986

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Champagne, gold dust, and

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
pink feathers heralded in

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
a new era for Owings Mills.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Today's opening of the Owings Mills

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Fashion Mall does not only mean a new

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
high fashion place to shop, it also

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
means lots of new developments and jobs

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
for Baltimore County. It had a

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Avenue. It was a big, high-end

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
mall. But in 1992,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
a woman who worked as a cleaner

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
at Saks was murdered during

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
an armed robbery on the trail between the mall

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and the Baltimore metro station.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
After the murder, the mall got a reputation

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
for being unsafe, and

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
slowly the stores closed down.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Dan recorded two videos at Owings

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Mills in 2015, when only

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
five of the original 155

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
stores remained.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
He takes us through the strangely clean

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and empty halls, the

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
drained fountains, the

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
gutted food court.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Watching these videos seems to provoke

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
an emotional response in a lot of

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
people. Some say they feel

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
nostalgic or sad, some

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
express rage at the waste and futility,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
some find it creepy or

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
even horrifying, and some

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
of it all. One commenter says,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I think it is still hitting people with

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
slow-motion shock that the

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
20th century is really over.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
In the 80s, this looked

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
like the start of a big new world

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
of wealth for everyone.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
In fact, it was the last gasp

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
of 20th century general

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
prosperity.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I agree with all these comments,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
and I feel every one of these

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
emotions. I think there is

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
a new aesthetic sensibility

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
emerging here, a gothic

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
aesthetic for the 21st century,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
this decaying opulence

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
that is the carcass of

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
20th century consumerism.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Oh, it gives me a chill!

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
My nape hair stands on end

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and a tingle goes down my

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
spine.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
The Owings Mills

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Mall was totally demolished in

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
late 2016, and Dan's

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
final video about it, we see clips

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
from his earlier Owings Mills videos

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
intercut with absolutely

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
post-apocalyptic footage of the

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
half-demolished ruin.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It's not like the feeling of

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
exploring a ruined temple or abbey

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
where you somehow perceive

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
the spiritual significance of the

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
original building. In a dead mall,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
you do sense the ghosts of

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
the shoppers and the workers,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
their aspirations and material

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
longings, but

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
what does the crumbling wreckage of a

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
J.C. Penney really mean?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
That is a question

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
that will haunt me to the grave.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Alright comrades,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I've said my piece.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I'll come quietly. There's no reason

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
to tie me down. I mean,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
unless you're into that. In which case,

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
by all means. No,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I won't resist.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I accept my fate.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
🎵

47:06.000 --> 47:31.000
🎵

47:32.700 --> 47:34.000
Fuck you, Romano.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.500
I'm glad your father died.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
Let's just get that out there before I just say it.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.500
I must be honest, definitely a Chinese chaser.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.500
But he was an incel.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.500
And definitely a Chinese chaser.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Look at me.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
I'm ashamed.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.500
I'm ashamed of what I've written.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.500
Huh?

48:00.500 --> 48:01.500
Kant, yeah.

48:01.500 --> 48:03.500
But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm...

48:03.500 --> 48:05.000
an asshole.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.500
I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I

48:09.500 --> 48:12.000
shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
How much leg do we want to get in here?

48:14.500 --> 48:16.000
A lot, I assume.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm just getting oil all over my fur.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Great.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.500
It's not real fur, whatever.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.500
Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.

48:23.500 --> 48:24.500
Ugh.

48:24.500 --> 48:26.000
Moral people.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
There's one that I can't stand.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.500
People who have some sense of decency.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.500
Okay.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
Is a hair light really a good idea?

48:34.500 --> 48:36.500
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?

48:36.500 --> 48:38.000
Who invented that?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
An asshole.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.500
What about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?

48:41.500 --> 48:44.000
Uh, I guess it was a shitty to be feminist.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.500
Ugh, Christ.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.500
The demands of these people.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.000
These bucky teeth, man.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
It's like...

48:52.000 --> 48:53.500
It's like being catty.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
Catty, catty.

48:55.500 --> 49:01.000
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
So catty and stupid.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Ugh, okay.
