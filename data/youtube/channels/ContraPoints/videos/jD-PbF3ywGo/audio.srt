1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
["Ach, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig, ach, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig, wie dichtig, wie flüchtig ist der Mensch im Himmel"]

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, hey, Quarch. Hey, how are you, Quarch?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, listen. I know this looks bad.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, fair enough.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How about this?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but first, you have to let me tell you my life story.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Fair? That's super fucking great.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll start at the beginning.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
where the most exciting attraction for children is the National Museum of Natural History.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
who, might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I liked a good stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but my real passion was the Gem and Mineral Hall.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Comrades, losers, and haters, I would like to propose

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that aesthetic sensibility, whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
begins with absolute pleasure.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You rotate the crystal in your hand and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down your spine.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, God!

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Northern Virginia is McMansion country,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and I would get excited by some little detail,

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But then my mom would say,

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look at this ostentatious trash!

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you learn.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You learn taste according to the social class of your upbringing.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And with taste comes all this adult baggage,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
snobbery and pretense and conceit.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I am but a simple queen longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, stripey sock catgirls of the heckin' Revolutionary Committee,

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
before you pass sentence,

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
allow me to make my case gorge.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One. Success.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh hey, how are you, gorge?

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Look, I like stuff.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I like shiny things.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There's a social context for it.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It generally means something.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, because he's trying to send a message.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Maybe to the world, maybe to himself.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's saying,

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Behold, I am a winner, a very stable genius with one of the highest IQs.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power,

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
from the pharaohs of Egypt to the kings of France

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I guess God likes shiny things too.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American Dream.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In the words of Drake,

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You've made it.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're rich, bitch.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Remember in high school when you had to read

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties,

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but he throws them anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it,

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that he's a success, that he's worth something.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And as we all remember, in the end,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to save the Hall of Hrothgar.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
about how the theme of The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I got a D minus.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining,

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I like those Balenciagas.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Fuck.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and driving lambs and all that shit,

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
but teacher, pick me, pick me.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's talk about symbols.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's talk about allegory.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's talk about metaphor.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's talk about themes.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Fellow students, let us place the text in historical context.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to making money moves.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's the American Dream.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a celebration of success for people who often come from backgrounds

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
where that kind of success is really improbable.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't you think it's kind of weird that conservatives still say,

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
rap music is the reason for the problems with the blacks?

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
For conservatives, the American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And is there any sector of our culture

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated than hip-hop?

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's not just hip-hop, though.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and the Ferraris and the Fendi and the Bugattis

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the Armani and the Maseratis.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Which, to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Burn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and replace it with a large-scale figure of Donatello Versace

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
holding a bottle of Cristal.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
than the hypocritical cheese furs currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We have standards in this country.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Listen up, America.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We live in a society.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Not of climbers, but of graspers.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To paraphrase Ian Danskin,

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
maybe anyone can achieve the American dream,

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but everyone cannot.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the fact of the matter is,

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
most people don't.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
unless someone else was poor?

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Not other rich people, that's for sure.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So when you live in a society

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that constantly equates wealth and success,

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but which is also so unequal

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that most people will never be wealthy,

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
well, what's the average person supposed to do?

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Two, fantasy.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I wish the world were my gem collection.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I wish I owned everything.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm really just the worst kind of Philistine, you know?

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I go to an art museum and it's like,

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Monet, Rembrandt,

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
okay, that's super fucking great,

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but can I buy it?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, no, I can't buy it.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So what do you do?

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, you fake it.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You create an illusion.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't own this building,

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and you rube off the streets of Baltimore

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and walk in here, as indeed you did.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But that's okay. I need a witness.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I need you to see me here

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
among the other art,

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
where I belong.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It makes me feel valuable.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because opulence is not abundance.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Opulence is the aesthetic of abundance.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The phrase, opulence, you own everything,

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
is at this point, basically a gay internet meme.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Opulence.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Opulence, opulence, opulence, opulence.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But it originally comes from the documentary

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Paris is Burning,

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
about the Harlem ballroom culture in the 1980s,

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
where it's proclaimed by MC Jr. LaBeija.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Opulence.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You own everything.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
of luxury and decadence.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of the queer Black and Latin American participants

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
of the balls,

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A lot of those kids that are in the balls,

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
they don't have two of nothing.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Some of them don't even eat.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamor,

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
an illusion created by skillful artifice.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Participants walk categories like executive realness,

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
with the goal of being indistinguishable

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
from a real executive.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Nowadays every white queer says the word realness,

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, whomst among us honestly hasn't

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
slipped into a dissociative fugue state,

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
dressed up as a clown,

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
kidnapped a few neighborhood children,

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and told the cops,

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I did it, officer.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I did the cultural appropriation.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am a colonizer.

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I am part of the problem.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And I'm sorry.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Take me away, boys.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's crazy.

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's mega coconuts.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I guess I should explain that American slang works

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
according to what we might call

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
a trickle-up model of linguistics.

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized

214
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
gay and trans people of color.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then those words trickle up to straight Black people

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and white gays,

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then finally white cishets start using them.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A lot of times the original meaning or context

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
gets lost along the way.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
between what is being emulated and what is absent,

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Realness, in that sense,

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is a much more complicated and interesting concept

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
than the generic trans notion of passing.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Passing is just looking like

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl,

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
whereas in the ballroom sense,

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're not really an executive,

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
but you're looking like an executive,

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and therefore you're showing the straight world

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that I can be an executive.

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If I had the opportunity, I could be one,

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
because I can look like one.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
in 80s ballroom culture, such as the FX drama Pose,

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
which is set during the era,

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's really important to people in this country

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to at least sometimes feel like they're living a luxe life,

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
even if in fact, they aren't.

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city

248
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
that exploits that need.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio,

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and Caesar's Palace are designed

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to make you feel like a fancy bitch,

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
even though they're actually just high-rise traps

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
designed to lure you in and take your money.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And if there's one thing I can't stand,

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
it's traps.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But the trap works,

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
because part of what it is to be American

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I actually love Vegas.

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Lindsay Ellis' bachelorette party.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-40s,

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I did once experience the first exciting stages

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
of a gambling habit.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and had some good luck playing blackjack.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, I wasn't a high roller or anything,

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And that was a lot of money to me.

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
At the time, I was working a customer service job

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
making $10 an hour,

273
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
so to make $200 in five minutes,

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that's worth 20 hours of soul-crushing

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
customer service toil.

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Before taxes.

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I went back and I went back,

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
but I never got lucky again.

279
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just absolute shock, despair,

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
this deep shame and self-disgust.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The kind of face that says,

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm gonna have to explain to my wife

287
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that I spent the kids' college savings

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
on a high-limit slot machine.

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And there is nothing opulent about that,

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
trying to pay off their hospital bills.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
America, we are a bad country.

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Donald Trump is a Vegas man,

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
he's pulling this grift on the entire country.

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
of the American dream is more enchanting to the imagination

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
but in fact, there are two very different types of magic

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
at work.

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
a demonstration of their wealth and power.

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But for the marginalized and impoverished,

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
they've been denied.

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
serving viper realness.

309
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Three, class.

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, how are you?

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey, how are you?

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey, how are you?

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey, how are you?

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hey, how are you?

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
People don't understand how difficult it is

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to be this blonde.

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You know, a biological female that looks like me,

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm afraid some transvestite psycho

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is gonna sneak in through a rear window

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and I'll have to dial M for murder.

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
difficult to apply to the present day.

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
As a typical modern woman,

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's praxis.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, bourgeoisie and proletariat?

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Whomst?

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Who is she?

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where's her summer collection?

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's super fucking great, but can I buy it?

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and a factory worker.

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Now, I could be out of touch,

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
but personally, I've never met a factory worker,

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or a factory owner for that matter.

338
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
They must all be on a brand trip to China,

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
working on the B&P summer collection.

340
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is that the bougies own the means of production

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and the proles work for wages.

343
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But what about a bartender who owns the bar she works in?

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What about YouTubers?

345
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Which side of the revolution are we on?

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm just trying to figure out where I stand here,

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
because if the revolution starts on Twitter,

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
my head is definitely going in the basket,

349
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and then I'll have no choice

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but to do the conservative talk show circuit.

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know, like most people

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
whose brains are detached from their bodies.

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Marie Antoinette did nothing wrong, A-R-U.

354
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes

355
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
must be overly simplistic.

356
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
My favorite book about class in America

357
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
is Paul Fussell's Class,

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
A Guide Through the American Status System,

359
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
which describes nine distinct classes.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Fussell is not as concerned

361
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
with economic relations between classes

362
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
as he is with status,

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

364
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Things like education, style, taste,

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and attitude towards money.

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now the book was published in 1983,

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but there's an eerie familiarity

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to a lot of the core observations.

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And it's also just pretty funny,

371
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
like his quasi-scientific observation

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
that the higher your social class,

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
the smaller the balls in the sports you play,

374
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
or his description of middle-class living rooms.

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Your real middle class refuses to show

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
any but the most bland books and magazines

377
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
on its coffee tables.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Otherwise, expressions of opinion,

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
awkward questions, or even ideas might result.

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
One of Fussell's core themes

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
is that it's not how much money you have

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that defines your class,

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
so much as how you got your money.

384
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you had to work for your money,

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
then you're not really upper class.

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The upper class has inherited wealth,

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and as a result they're very confident

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
they don't feel the need to prove themselves.

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
their position on the ladder.

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But then there's the middle class,

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
who are social climbers,

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and who compensate for their insecurities by,

394
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
for example, placing a pretentious collage

395
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
of university bumper stickers on the back of the family car.

396
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The higher and lower classes,

398
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
there's some good in them,

399
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
but the middle classes are all affectation

400
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and conceit and pretense and concealment.

401
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
by people with something to prove,

403
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
whether it's marginalized ballroom performers

404
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
proving their worth to themselves

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
or the new rich building McMansions

406
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
to show off their wealth to others.

407
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump.

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He inherited his wealth,

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
so he should know better than to have golden faucets.

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But he doesn't.

411
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
As Fran Lebowitz said,

412
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
he's a poor person's idea of a rich person.

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And that's actually his charm.

414
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's part of his mass appeal.

415
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery.

416
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So there's actually something kind of relatable,

417
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic

418
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
about the golden faucets.

419
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
People who have wealth but not class

420
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
are actually very popular in this country.

421
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We don't like class here,

422
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
because class is exclusionary.

423
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth,

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
we tell ourselves.

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So wealth feels potentially inclusive of everyone,

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
even though in practice, it isn't.

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Now the upper-class cultural elite in this country,

428
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
the real classy people,

429
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
are mostly very unlike Trump.

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,

431
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
they embrace the reserved old-money values

432
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
of aristocratic wasps,

433
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

434
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Fussell notes, for instance,

435
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

436
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They like to live at the end of long driveways

437
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and houses away from public view.

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They dress down while traveling

439
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

440
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
These are essentially survival skills

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
of the experienced rich.

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
If you flaunt your wealth too much,

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
people might rob you,

444
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
or they might get envious

445
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

446
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or worse, taxation.

447
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Old money knows this,

448
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but new money just cannot resist

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the temptation to show off.

450
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper class

451
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
is dying out.

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory

453
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
of money over class.

454
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
His presidency validates the idea

455
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that you can be as vulgar as you want

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
so long as you have the cash to back it up.

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So the old class system is dying out,

458
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and in its place,

459
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
we have universally adopted the mindset

460
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
of the nouveau riche.

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you got it, flaunt it.

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you haven't got it,

463
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
find a way to flaunt it anyway.

464
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Now I'm sure this is all very tragic

465
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and disappointing to people of class and taste,

466
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur,

467
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's actually fantastic news.

468
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Listen comrades,

469
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I've been pretty down on opulence so far,

470
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and I could continue analyzing it

471
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
in terms of inequality and class struggle,

472
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but you already know all that.

473
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's why you came to cut my head off.

474
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But hold on,

475
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
is that really all there is to aesthetics,

476
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Marxist economic analysis,

477
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
or the SJW version

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that makes everything about race and gender?

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

480
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but remember that it's both possible

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and even necessary

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
to simultaneously enjoy media

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
while also being critical of its more problematic

484
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
or pernicious aspects.

485
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So what about the enjoyment part?

486
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Surely you wouldn't behead a queen

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
just for liking shiny thing.

488
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

489
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,

490
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the fine Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport-Kunt,

491
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that is, completely free of any material desire.

493
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Of course, Ms. Thing also founded the hashtag NoFap movement,

494
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
so I don't know how seriously you want to take that.

495
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But it's actually kind of similar

496
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,

497
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that it merely begins with a desire

498
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
for the bodies of beautiful boys,

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
which is really just a shadow of our true longing

500
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
for the concept of beauty itself.

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is just a bunch of repressed homos

503
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

504
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What must that be like?

505
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
From the bottom of my motherfucking

506
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and my fatherfucking heart,

507
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that must be super fucking hard for them,

508
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can't even imagine.

509
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I mean, it makes sense, really.

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Straight men don't have these problems.

511
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years

512
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and never had to think about it.

513
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I guess Nietzsche's the exception.

514
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He was straight and a philosopher,

515
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
but he was an incel and, let's be honest,

516
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
definitely a tranny chaser.

517
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history

518
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is the respectable English gentleman Oscar Wilde.

519
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
According to Wilde,

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things

521
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
are corrupt without being charming.

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This is a fault.

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things

524
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are the cultivated.

525
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
For these, there is hope.

526
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They are the elect to whom beautiful things

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
mean only beauty.

528
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Spoken like a poet,

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
you want to be cultivated, don't you?

530
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

531
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Look, I'll play it your way.

532
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Let's swing back to the other side

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.

534
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
As sentimental as I personally am

535
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
about art for art's sake and all of that,

536
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but from a strictly sociological perspective,

537
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I have to admit,

538
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
taste is pretty intimately related to power.

539
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
When you go to a museum,

540
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
you look at various objects on pedestals

541
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
under special lighting that makes them appear magical.

542
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Now that's also what you do at Bed Bath & Beyond,

543
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but the difference is that at the museum,

544
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
you can't buy anything.

545
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.

546
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In the retail context of commodity fetishism,

547
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Whereas in the museum,

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because you can't buy anything,

550
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,

551
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that you're simply enjoying out-of-context objects.

552
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But of course, that's an illusion.

553
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The museum is the context,

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and the context is telling you

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that the things you're looking at are art.

556
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And whoever decides what's in the museum

557
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
decides what good taste is,

558
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
what's beautiful,

559
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
what's valuable.

560
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Beyoncé and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,

562
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
conferring upon themselves the status

563
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and the cultural grandeur of the art.

564
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But it's not just a flex.

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It means something more than that

566
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
because of the racial disparity

567
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
between the performers and the setting.

568
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Black people and black art

569
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre,

570
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
so seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,

571
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
with black dancers even overshadowing

572
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
canonical European art,

573
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it's like a full moment.

574
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
A lot of people have a deep longing

575
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
for the sense of dignity and grandeur

576
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
conferred by classical art.

577
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's why trans women love that picture

578
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
someone photoshopped of the Three Graces,

579
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
but with dicks.

580
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll admit that silly picture

581
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
actually had an emotional effect on me

582
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
because here in the West,

583
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful

584
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.

585
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, speaking of which,

586
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
white marble is a lie.

587
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
For most of art history history,

588
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
scholars have insisted

589
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
that the iconic ghostly whiteness

590
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
of classical statues

591
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
was the distinguishing feature of Western sculpture,

592
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
proof of the elegant taste

593
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

594
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
In reality, of course, it turns out

595
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
they were painted the colors of something

596
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
a drag queen might wear to a quinceañera.

597
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants

598
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
on these statues for hundreds of years,

599
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but were totally in denial about it

600
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
because the pure whiteness of these figures

601
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
was like a sacred dogma.

602
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Margaret Talbot in The New Yorker

603
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
attributes the dogma in part to

604
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
a tendency to equate whiteness

605
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,

606
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.

607
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Garish.

608
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In 2008, Fabio Beri, an art historian

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
who is now at Stanford,

610
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
complained that a boldly colored

611
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
recreation of a statue of the Emperor Augustus

612
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
at the Vatican Museum

613
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

614
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey, how are you?

615
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And you just know that when the news first broke,

616
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
some horrified WASP classicists

617
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
turned to a colleague and said,

618
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, Kingsley, it looks,

619
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
it looks Mexican.

620
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,

621
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
some art historians have been harassed

622
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
by the alt-right,

623
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
who don't take kindly to anyone

624
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
questioning their white supremacist myths about antiquity.

625
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There's some pretty insidious, uh,

626
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
identitarian prejudices here

627
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
hiding out under the cloak of taste.

628
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Good taste for upper- and middle-class white people

629
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
generally includes a reflexive disdain

630
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
for anything a little bit too...

631
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
colorful.

632
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's these classes that constantly use the words

633
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

634
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,

635
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
the History of Leopard Print,

636
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
observes that

637
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Tacky, as a concept,

638
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
refers to the lack of cultivation

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
or the resistance to taste,

640
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and more often than not,

641
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
refers to tastes that are not suitably conservative.

642
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine,

643
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ethnic, queer, deviant,

644
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
not manly, not practical,

645
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
not businesslike, not serious.

646
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Aesthetic excess,

647
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
particularly of colors, patterns, and bling,

648
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.

649
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,

650
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
where the heart is,

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
where the soul is,

652
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and where the fun is.

653
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Well that's good news,

654
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I can't imagine why.

656
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

657
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Or camp.

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
People call me camp,

659
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

660
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

661
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Camp was the theme of this year's Met Gala,

662
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and my feed was flooded with Brooklynite intellectuals

663
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
competing to outwit each other

664
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.

665
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The first I'll call coward camp,

667
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

668
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

669
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This is nothing but an anxious and defensive refusal to take a risk.

670
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You think you're safe from criticism

671
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
because your look is bad on purpose.

672
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Fuck that.

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Take a stand, you pussy bitch.

674
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I take great offense to this

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
as a person whose look is bad on accident,

676
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and Susan Sontag agrees with me.

677
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

678
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
naive and deliberate camp.

679
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Pure camp is always naive.

680
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Camp which knows itself to be camp,

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
or camping, is usually less satisfying.

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,

683
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control

684
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and enters into absurd territory.

685
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Hey, how are you?

686
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I don't know, my philosophy of style

687
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is that people should wear what looks good to them.

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

689
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I think my aesthetic is good.

690
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This is what looks good to me,

691
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
though I'm aware other people might judge it.

692
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I like what John Waters said about there being

693
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
good bad taste and bad bad taste.

694
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
One must remember, there is such a thing as

695
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
good bad taste and bad bad taste.

696
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

697
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I've wondered for a long time

698
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

699
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

700
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

701
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Why am I so tacky?

702
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think it's because I'm a transsexual,

703
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
which lowers you at least a class.

704
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual,

705
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you're middle class now, bitch.

706
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual,

707
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
you are now lower class.

708
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual,

709
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
ooh, sweaty, you'd better start a revolution.

710
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Uh, Marsha P. Johnson, hey how are you?

711
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Chicks with bread.

712
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour,

713
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
at least those of us who came of age in the 1960s.

714
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
In the most basic everyday sense,

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
glam is a way of styling yourself.

716
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's luxuriant hair, it's high drama makeup,

717
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
it's long nails, it's glitter everywhere,

718
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
it's posing like a fashion model.

719
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But originally the word glamour comes from

720
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the Scottish word grammary, meaning magic or enchantment.

721
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And glamour still involves a kind of illusion,

722
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
or charm, cast on a spectator.

723
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The connection between glamour and opulence

724
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
is explored in the 2004 essay

725
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Viva Me Glam?

726
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Is Transgenderism a Critique of,

727
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Opulence-Driven Glamour Models,

728
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
by transgender writer and underground house music producer

729
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Terry Temlitz, aka DJ Sprinkles.

730
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Sprinkles writes,

731
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour,

732
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or grammary, that was associated with

733
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
witchcraft, paganism, and sexual deviancy.

734
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But in our capitalist society,

735
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
glamour is a spell of opulence,

736
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life.

737
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
For example, a lot of dry queens practice

738
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities,

739
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses,

740
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
pop stars, and models secondhand.

741
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Sprinkles is bothered by the way this sort of

742
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
secondhand glamour acquires its power

743
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
from unquestioned social hierarchies.

744
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Glamour is suspect as a critical-minded

745
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
political form because it is about

746
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
social distance, not social integration.

747
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The promise of the pop glam diva is not

748
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
the promise of social transformation,

749
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
but individual transformation,

750
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
in which the exploited becomes the exploiter.

751
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It is the promise of an individual's class mobility,

752
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
not social betterment or class critique.

753
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It is, by and large, the American Dream.

754
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Now I have to admit, this is a version

755
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
of the American Dream that hits

756
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
pretty close to home for me.

757
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The overarching plotline of my whole

758
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
entire YouTube gender journey is that

759
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I used to be a tragic mess.

760
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I'm still a tragic mess, but when I started

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
this channel I was a broke, gender dysphoric,

762
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
alcoholic, cross-dressing tragic mess.

763
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'd play a clip, but honestly those videos

764
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
are still too painful for me to even glance at.

765
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And now, I mean look at me, look how far I've come.

766
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I look like a moderately talented female impersonator,

767
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
hey how are you?

768
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Those first several months of transition though,

769
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
they were rough.

770
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I had a lot of trouble in the beginning.

771
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I used to get laughed out of restaurants.

772
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And I was so proud that I wouldn't let

773
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
anyone see how much that stuff hurt me.

774
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You know, I would say,

775
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
well fuck them, I know I'm great.

776
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And then I'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car.

777
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And I was a YouTuber that whole time too,

778
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
which, I mean the cyberbullying alone,

779
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't think you can even imagine the extent of it

780
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
if you haven't been in that situation.

781
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You know, hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice,

782
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
picking apart your face and body,

783
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
clocking your clothes and makeup,

784
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
digging up your past, trying to deduce

785
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
the nature of your sexual pathology

786
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
from the shape of your skull.

787
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A lot of it's hilarious to me now,

788
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain.

789
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But that pain spurred me to work on my glow-up

790
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
like it was the cure for cancer,

791
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
like my life depended on it,

792
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
which is basically how it felt.

793
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Now, sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as,

794
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
as one tweeter put it,

795
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
cripplingly obsessed with passing.

796
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me,

797
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
but glam, to me, is not about passing.

798
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I think I actually pass better in no makeup

799
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
than I do in eyeshadow out to here.

800
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You know, a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here,

801
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and people think she's just really into makeup

802
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
or Instagram or cosplay or something,

803
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
but when I do it, I think it looks like drag,

804
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
which serves to call more attention to my situation.

805
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But on YouTube, I mean,

806
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
clearly I don't try to pass as a normal woman.

807
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Everyone here knows I'm trans anyway,

808
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
so what's the point?

809
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I would describe this presentation

810
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
as female impersonator,

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and that's basically what I am,

812
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
a female female impersonator.

813
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And I present this way because it's fun,

814
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I find it artistically fulfilling,

815
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and let's be honest, there's part of me

816
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that always wanted to be that kind of

817
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
larger-than-life superwoman.

818
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But I'm also creating special effects for the camera.

819
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
As Sprinkles says,

820
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Now, a lot of leftist trans people

821
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
have grown disillusioned

822
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
with the individual class mobility

823
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
represented by glamour,

824
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
as well as by transition glow-up narratives.

825
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I think that disillusionment

826
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and a growing revolutionary sentiment

827
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
are at the heart of this intense

828
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
anger and resentment

829
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
that trans people have for trans women.

830
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And I think that's what I'm trying to do

831
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
with this video,

832
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and I'm trying to make it

833
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
are at the heart of this intense anger

834
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and resentment I've noticed

835
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
a lot of trans women have for drag queens,

836
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
for glamorous trans Instagram models,

837
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and let's be honest,

838
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
for me.

839
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Here's Sprinkles one more time.

840
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
As long as an MTF's public acceptance

841
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
is gauged by her ability to emulate

842
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
glamorous body and style requirements

843
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
that elude most, quote,

844
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
real women, then I'll have to ask you

845
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to pardon this transgendered writer

846
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
for not feeling represented

847
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
by RuPaul any more

848
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
than my mother feels represented

849
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
by Marilyn Monroe or Princess Di.

850
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
A lot of trans women

851
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
are basically fed up with having to

852
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
serve the world of fantasy all the time.

853
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They want to be seen for who they are

854
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
without doing any of that shit.

855
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
They're fed up with glamour.

856
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They're fed up with realness.

857
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They're fed up with RuPaul.

858
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And a lot of them are pretty fed up with me.

859
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And I oop, and I oop, and I oop.

860
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Six. Envy.

861
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The Marxist art critic John Berger

862
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
called glamour the happiness

863
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
of being envied.

864
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Being envied is a solitary form of reassurance.

865
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It depends precisely

866
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
upon not sharing your experiences

867
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
with those who envy you.

868
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But being envied is a form of happiness

869
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
only in the imagination.

870
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The actual experience of being envied sucks.

871
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is the risk of opulence.

872
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It invites not just

873
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
enchanted admiration, but also

874
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
envy. And where envy goes,

875
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the guillotine follows.

876
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Or at least, vindictive taxation.

877
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This is why the experienced

878
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
rich know to tone down the opulence,

879
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
build a nice high wall around their properties,

880
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and make a lot of high-profile

881
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
charitable donations.

882
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We can call this kind of strategizing

883
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the public relations of success.

884
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It certainly helps to have a rags-to-riches story,

885
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
especially if you can make other people

886
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
feel included in some way in your success.

887
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's part of the appeal

888
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
of hip-hop opulence, is that it seems

889
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
to elevate not just a single performer,

890
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but an entire underclass.

891
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Conversely, being

892
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
perceived as exclusionary, elitist,

893
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
or snobbish is gonna cost

894
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
you big in terms of envy management.

895
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
YouTube music critic Todd

896
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in the Shadows did a review of Ariana

897
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Grande's song Seven Rings, in which

898
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
he basically drags Ariana, who

899
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
apparently is white, for appropriating

900
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
a bunch of hip-hop rags-to-riches signifiers

901
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
without any of the subtext of

902
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
starting from the bottom. She's not

903
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
showcasing a triumph over adversity,

904
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
she's just a white girl who

905
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
likes stuff. We started

906
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
from the bottom, now the whole team

907
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is fucking here. So in Todd's

908
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
words, the song is a grotesque, bullying,

909
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
VIP-only privilege flex

910
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
of a mean girl shoving her wealth

911
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
in your face. I actually like that

912
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
song, but I'm into that sort

913
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
of thing. Bully me, mommy.

914
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Aww! Fellow students,

915
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
as a case study in the public relations

916
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
of success and envy management,

917
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
let us compare and contrast

918
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
two successful YouTubers,

919
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Jeffree Star and Gigi Gorgeous.

920
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
There's enough similarities between them

921
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
for the differences to be interesting.

922
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They're both LGB and or T, they're both

923
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
white, they're both blonde sometimes,

924
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
they're both feminine, they're both rich,

925
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and they both flaunt their opulent

926
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
lifestyles. But nonetheless,

927
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
people basically seem to like

928
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Jeffree Star, whereas

929
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Gigi, well,

930
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I don't want to say people don't like her,

931
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but they don't relate to her.

932
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The best example of this is her

933
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
2017 video, I Wear Walmart

934
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
for a Week, with its gasp-inducing

935
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
like-to-dislike ratio.

936
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Let's analyze what went wrong here.

937
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So, for today's video, I thought

938
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
we would take it to a place I've

939
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
never been, Walmart. So that's a bad

940
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
start, Gorge. Most Americans

941
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
have been to Walmart. Never having

942
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
been marks your upbringing as upper-middle

943
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
class, at least.

944
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Treating going to Walmart as some kind of

945
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
challenge kind of comes across as you

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and your rich friends being like,

947
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
what if we pretend to be poor for a day?

948
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I wonder if we're gonna see any people at Walmart,

949
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you know that website? Babies crying,

950
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the trauma. Gigi,

951
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
no! You need to turn the shade down,

952
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
like, 20 notches, Gorge.

953
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I keep taking my shin on this cart,

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm literally gonna have bruises.

955
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Can someone remake these carts,

956
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
please? It's dangerous.

957
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
They're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.

958
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What should we get next?

959
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Maybe like a gown for a red carpet?

960
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Do they sell gowns here?

961
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
This, to me, is peak Gigi,

962
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
strolling down the aisles of Walmart

963
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
with a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew

964
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that she's plucked from the shelves,

965
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
saying, I need something for a red

966
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
carpet. Do they have gowns here?

967
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This, to me,

968
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is an iconic fashion moment.

969
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
This is naive camp. This is everything.

970
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The idea that she has privileges that

971
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
other people don't has never

972
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
once crossed her mind, and that is a

973
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
very special, precious

974
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
thing that I want to cherish.

975
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Personally, I have no choice but to stan.

976
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The YouTube comments section, however,

977
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is not as amused as I am,

978
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
nor as forgiving.

979
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is the second time I've done a close reading of a

980
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Gigi video. It's getting kinda weird.

981
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Also, why hasn't she answered my letters?

982
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Step on my throat, mommy.

983
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now let's look at Jeffree Star. Jeffree does

984
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
similar kinds of videos to Gigi.

985
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He's even done his own video wearing Walmart

986
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
today, which people loved.

987
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Now my first impulse when explaining the differences

988
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
in public perception is to scream

989
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SEXISM. And there's maybe a little

990
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
of that going on. I do think a rich

991
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
woman is more irritating to people than

992
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
a rich man, but there's clearly more than that

993
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
going on here. Jeffree's fans are,

994
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I assume mostly women, and

995
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
not rich women, regular women.

996
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The women who work at the dollar store love him.

997
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm like your biggest fan.

998
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching

999
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of

1000
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
designer bags and clothes because they either

1001
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
live vicariously through him or they see

1002
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
him as aspirational. It's the same

1003
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
reason why poor people have always enjoyed

1004
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
watching reality TV shows about

1005
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the extremely wealthy. The centerpiece

1006
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's

1007
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
self-made. He represents himself

1008
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
as having started from the bottom.

1009
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing

1010
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and just generally seems

1011
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head.

1012
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
A good example of this is his private

1013
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
jet Burger King mukbang.

1014
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Now at first you might think that a private jet

1015
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
is not very relatable, but the Burger King

1016
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
aspect brings it back down to earth.

1017
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Jeffree seems like he's

1018
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
been to Burger King before.

1019
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He's able to order fluently, he's even

1020
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
kind of charming to the cashier.

1021
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He doesn't scoff or pinch his nose

1022
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
at anything. Also, the Gucci

1023
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
barrette. Whereas

1024
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Gigi, I mean don't get me wrong,

1025
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I do love Gigi, but

1026
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't know if sis would make it

1027
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
out of Burger King alive.

1028
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class

1029
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
solacism like, I don't know,

1030
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
not understanding the concept

1031
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make

1032
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
an entertaining video, just

1033
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
not a relatable video.

1034
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis

1035
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
from the toilet seat and do a story time about that.

1036
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's really when Gigi's at her best.

1037
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
She kind of comes back down to earth whenever she's

1038
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
serving real transsexual housewives

1039
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
at Beverly Hills meets David Cronenberg.

1040
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So I'm like, I see

1041
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
this white little chiclet in my hand.

1042
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm feeling with my tongue and I'm like,

1043
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
OH MY GOD.

1044
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Economic inequality in this country has always been enabled

1045
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
by the fact that people

1046
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
basically like the rich.

1047
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, we judge people who live in McMansions

1048
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and we get irritated by elitist, out-of-touch

1049
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
behavior. But

1050
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
ultimately, we have no choice

1051
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
but to stand. And the people we stand

1052
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the hardest are people like Jeffree Star,

1053
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
who, in a way, seems like

1054
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
a poor person who just

1055
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
so happens to be very rich.

1056
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And if inequality increases enough,

1057
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I suspect the standing will stop.

1058
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend

1059
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
$69,000 in one trip to the Louis Vuitton store

1060
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
if what you're doing is

1061
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
fantasizing about what you would buy

1062
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
with that much money. But if you're thinking about

1063
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
how $69,000 could pay off your

1064
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
life-ruining medical debt, or about

1065
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments

1066
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
for your dying wife, this kind of thing

1067
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
will start getting under your skin.

1068
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And eventually, people

1069
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
will start building guillotines again.

1070
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
In fact, the only way I can imagine

1071
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
a revolution happening in this country

1072
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
is if rich people start behaving

1073
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
as badly as possible.

1074
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So this isn't your dream job?

1075
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No. And this is free, right?

1076
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Whatever you want.

1077
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Seven. Ruin.

1078
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Good evening,

1079
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Gorge. Ever notice how

1080
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
most vampires are like

1081
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
counts or queens or

1082
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
at least rich? I guess

1083
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
some are edgy biker teens, but

1084
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't associate with that trash.

1085
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Gothic horror really got started

1086
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
as a genre with 18th and 19th

1087
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
century novels, which were usually

1088
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
set in an old, decaying castle

1089
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
or mansion. By the late 19th century,

1090
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
the aristocracy had lost a lot

1091
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
of its relevance as a class,

1092
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula

1093
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
represented a dying

1094
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
world order, and also

1095
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
maybe the metaphorical blood-sucking

1096
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
of commoners by the landed gentry.

1097
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Vampires were also usually seducers,

1098
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and the aristocrat seducer

1099
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
trope had actually played an important

1100
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
role in turning public opinion

1101
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
against the nobility. So the

1102
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
gothic aesthetic is an aesthetic of

1103
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
dead and decaying opulence.

1104
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And that aesthetic has evolved over time,

1105
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
from the ruins of a medieval castle

1106
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to the iconic haunted house,

1107
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
which in American horror is

1108
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
usually a decaying Victorian

1109
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
mansion. It's a trope with an

1110
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
interesting backstory. During the

1111
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
golden age, industrialization produced

1112
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
a new wealthy class of people

1113
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
who built what were essentially 19th

1114
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
century McMansions. When the Great

1115
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian

1116
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
mansions were abandoned and began

1117
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
to decay, which gave them morbid

1118
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
associations that made them perfect

1119
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
for stories about hauntings

1120
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and psychos

1121
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and weirdos. So ruined

1122
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
opulence becomes

1123
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
gothic, which kind of makes you think.

1124
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We live in an age of opulence

1125
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and inequality and growing

1126
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
irritation with abusive men in power,

1127
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the middle class is shrinking,

1128
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
social unrest is on the rise,

1129
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it seems like a new economic

1130
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
order could be on the horizon.

1131
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
When the opulence of our age decays,

1132
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
will there be a new gothic

1133
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
aesthetic of ruined shopping

1134
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
malls? Well, there

1135
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
kind of already is.

1136
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a

1137
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series,

1138
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
in which he explores the ruins of

1139
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
abandoned shopping malls. For example,

1140
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the now demolished Owings Mills

1141
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Mall just north of Baltimore.

1142
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The mall opened in 1986

1143
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

1144
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Champagne, gold dust, and

1145
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
pink feathers heralded in

1146
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
a new era for Owings Mills.

1147
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Today's opening of the Owings Mills

1148
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Fashion Mall does not only mean a new

1149
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
high fashion place to shop, it also

1150
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
means lots of new developments and jobs

1151
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
for Baltimore County. It had a

1152
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth

1153
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Avenue. It was a big, high-end

1154
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
mall. But in 1992,

1155
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
a woman who worked as a cleaner

1156
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
at Saks was murdered during

1157
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
an armed robbery on the trail between the mall

1158
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and the Baltimore metro station.

1159
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
After the murder, the mall got a reputation

1160
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
for being unsafe, and

1161
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
slowly the stores closed down.

1162
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Dan recorded two videos at Owings

1163
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Mills in 2015, when only

1164
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
five of the original 155

1165
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
stores remained.

1166
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He takes us through the strangely clean

1167
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and empty halls, the

1168
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
drained fountains, the

1169
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
gutted food court.

1170
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Watching these videos seems to provoke

1171
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
an emotional response in a lot of

1172
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
people. Some say they feel

1173
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
nostalgic or sad, some

1174
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
express rage at the waste and futility,

1175
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
some find it creepy or

1176
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
even horrifying, and some

1177
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
have a dark sense of humor about the absurdity

1178
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
of it all. One commenter says,

1179
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I think it is still hitting people with

1180
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
slow-motion shock that the

1181
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
20th century is really over.

1182
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
In the 80s, this looked

1183
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
like the start of a big new world

1184
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
of wealth for everyone.

1185
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
In fact, it was the last gasp

1186
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
of 20th century general

1187
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
prosperity.

1188
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I agree with all these comments,

1189
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and I feel every one of these

1190
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
emotions. I think there is

1191
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
a new aesthetic sensibility

1192
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
emerging here, a gothic

1193
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
aesthetic for the 21st century,

1194
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
this decaying opulence

1195
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that is the carcass of

1196
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
20th century consumerism.

1197
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, it gives me a chill!

1198
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
My nape hair stands on end

1199
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and a tingle goes down my

1200
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
spine.

1201
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The Owings Mills

1202
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Mall was totally demolished in

1203
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
late 2016, and Dan's

1204
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
final video about it, we see clips

1205
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
from his earlier Owings Mills videos

1206
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
intercut with absolutely

1207
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
post-apocalyptic footage of the

1208
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
half-demolished ruin.

1209
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's not like the feeling of

1210
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
exploring a ruined temple or abbey

1211
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
where you somehow perceive

1212
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the spiritual significance of the

1213
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
original building. In a dead mall,

1214
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
you do sense the ghosts of

1215
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
the shoppers and the workers,

1216
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
their aspirations and material

1217
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
longings, but

1218
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
what does the crumbling wreckage of a

1219
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
J.C. Penney really mean?

1220
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That is a question

1221
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that will haunt me to the grave.

1222
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Alright comrades,

1223
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I've said my piece.

1224
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'll come quietly. There's no reason

1225
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
to tie me down. I mean,

1226
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
unless you're into that. In which case,

1227
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
by all means. No,

1228
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I won't resist.

1229
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I accept my fate.

1230
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
🎵

1231
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:31,000
🎵

1232
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,000
Fuck you, Romano.

1233
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
I'm glad your father died.

1234
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Let's just get that out there before I just say it.

1235
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I must be honest, definitely a Chinese chaser.

1236
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny.

1237
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,500
But he was an incel.

1238
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
And definitely a Chinese chaser.

1239
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Look at me.

1240
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm ashamed.

1241
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,500
I'm ashamed of what I've written.

1242
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Huh?

1243
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Kant, yeah.

1244
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm...

1245
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,000
an asshole.

1246
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,500
I hope you're enjoying this theory and watching me rub snot into my hands as I

1247
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,000
shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.

1248
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
How much leg do we want to get in here?

1249
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,000
A lot, I assume.

1250
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm just getting oil all over my fur.

1251
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Great.

1252
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,500
It's not real fur, whatever.

1253
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Let me clarify that for the vegans in the comments section.

1254
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Ugh.

1255
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,000
Moral people.

1256
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
There's one that I can't stand.

1257
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
People who have some sense of decency.

1258
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Okay.

1259
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Is a hair light really a good idea?

1260
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness?

1261
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,000
Who invented that?

1262
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
An asshole.

1263
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,500
What about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?

1264
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,000
Uh, I guess it was a shitty to be feminist.

1265
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,500
Ugh, Christ.

1266
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
The demands of these people.

1267
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,000
These bucky teeth, man.

1268
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's like...

1269
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,500
It's like being catty.

1270
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Catty, catty.

1271
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:01,000
That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

1272
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So catty and stupid.

1273
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Ugh, okay.
