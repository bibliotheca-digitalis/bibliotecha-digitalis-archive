00:00.000 --> 00:29.960
Death, death, death, death, death, is the only thing everyone fears.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.120
And the only thing that gets me off.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.440
Hello, my devilish darlings.

00:35.440 --> 00:42.240
I am Lenora LeVay, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.560
Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.920
The story is rather simple, really.

00:48.920 --> 00:53.280
The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and

00:53.280 --> 00:54.280
them.

00:54.280 --> 00:59.920
And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable

00:59.920 --> 01:03.480
health care, and video games for lesbians.

01:03.480 --> 01:11.160
But there's one man who stands in the way, the villain of tonight's thriller, a meddling

01:11.160 --> 01:18.200
little cipher of a man, a man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
to chaos.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.600
Can you imagine?

01:21.600 --> 01:28.360
His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.600
Can our heroine put a stop to this?

01:30.600 --> 01:33.400
Well, I'm just the executioner.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.160
You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.

01:58.360 --> 02:09.040
Hi girls, it's me, Ms. Points, Mademoiselle Poin.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.200
Words, words, words, what do they even fucking mean?

02:12.200 --> 02:16.760
Well, I don't know, and I don't care, but we have to talk about it anyway, because of

02:16.760 --> 02:18.480
a boy named Ben Shapiro.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.280
So who is Ben Shapiro?

02:20.280 --> 02:25.840
Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of the Daily Wire, and the auteur

02:25.840 --> 02:30.480
behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben

02:30.480 --> 02:35.200
Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College

02:35.200 --> 02:39.720
Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.

02:39.720 --> 02:45.600
Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing

02:45.600 --> 02:48.240
refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.560
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
a she.

02:52.560 --> 02:57.120
It's surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.120
And let's be civil, right?

02:59.120 --> 03:00.280
That's the tone of the day.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
I'm a fan.

03:01.280 --> 03:05.880
But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
his edgier mantra,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.560
Facts don't care about your feelings.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.120
And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.000
It's true, facts don't care about my feelings.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.440
I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.600
This makes me feel invalidated.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.120
Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad, are true.

03:26.120 --> 03:31.200
It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling abs, but too fucking

03:31.200 --> 03:36.160
bad for me, because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
at forever.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.400
Mm, I was a yum-yum though.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.780
Build me a time machine, doc.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.280
We call this auto-androphilia, nurse.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.280
What can I say?

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
I like younger men.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.440
I'm a cougar.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
In tiger's clothing.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.960
So look, I want to be treated like an adult.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.600
I don't want to be indulged.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.480
If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.360
I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to

03:59.360 --> 04:01.400
tell myself to make it through the night.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.200
It's probably just dry down there, they're just ingrown hairs.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.240
I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.520
I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other

04:12.520 --> 04:14.920
of course false and heathen religions.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.320
I am an evangelical transsexual.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.000
I don't want toleration, dammit.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I want converts.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Excuse me, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.760
Do you have a moment to talk about my woman head?

04:23.760 --> 04:24.760
Sure.

04:24.760 --> 04:25.760
Go ahead.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.760
Touch it.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.760
So look, Shapiro.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.760
Benny.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Baby.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.360
I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales.

04:32.360 --> 04:37.800
To melt away every crystal of my snowflakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
tea.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Alright, big boy?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.160
Let's have it.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.920
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.200
I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
Because you can't change her sex.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.200
You can change her name.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.200
Caitlyn Jenner is a man.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
A biological man.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.600
And if he were born with a high dosage of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
not be a woman.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Right.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
You are determined by your chromosomes.

04:55.600 --> 05:00.680
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,

05:00.680 --> 05:02.800
that is, XX sex chromosomes.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.640
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would

05:07.640 --> 05:09.400
be tantamount to a lie.

05:09.400 --> 05:14.960
I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't let a transgender

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
like woman be called she or something.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.400
Because it is a lie.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.720
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means

05:22.720 --> 05:28.600
to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans

05:28.600 --> 05:32.540
woman she, we are saying that she has a normal female karyotype.

05:32.540 --> 05:37.920
But hold on, I'm a transgender woman and I've never claimed to have a normal female karyotype,

05:37.920 --> 05:44.200
and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend,

05:44.200 --> 05:48.720
ladies, good girl, good girl, just like that, don't stop, don't stop.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.120
Are all of us deluded about my biology?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
No.

05:52.120 --> 05:57.680
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro, it is you who misunderstands language.

05:57.680 --> 06:02.240
You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.080
We all agree on the biology.

06:04.080 --> 06:10.360
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man, and woman.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.520
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?

06:13.520 --> 06:18.240
Well there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.840
If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists

06:22.840 --> 06:28.080
and study the way a word, for instance she, is used by a linguistic community, and whatever

06:28.080 --> 06:30.480
the social convention is is what's correct.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.280
But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way

06:34.280 --> 06:40.000
the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority such as the dictionary,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.760
or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy, or we must have some goal that we want to

06:43.760 --> 06:47.920
accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.920
Now if we take the descriptive approach, you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call

06:51.920 --> 06:53.920
me she, and that's all there is to it.

06:53.920 --> 06:59.640
What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical, you don't put an article

06:59.640 --> 07:00.640
before a pronoun.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.840
That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.760
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and

07:07.760 --> 07:12.320
she originate in the Proto-Germanic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern

07:12.320 --> 07:14.760
Europe beginning around 500 BCE.

07:14.760 --> 07:18.960
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language

07:18.960 --> 07:24.160
refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic

07:24.160 --> 07:25.800
tradition, Ben Shapiro.

07:25.800 --> 07:31.360
However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.160
So let's try out a prescriptive approach.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.880
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word

07:38.880 --> 07:41.000
should be used?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.960
Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated

07:45.960 --> 07:47.400
by political goals.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.840
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to

07:51.840 --> 07:57.160
reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women

07:57.160 --> 08:02.240
she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level

08:02.240 --> 08:04.600
of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.440
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.360
Opponents argued the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a

08:12.360 --> 08:19.080
man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed because… it's the definition.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.080
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

08:21.080 --> 08:25.400
And on the other hand, gay people argued that the definition should be changed, because

08:25.400 --> 08:29.400
they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.400
And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
words.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.240
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the bible, and for that matter you can

08:39.240 --> 08:40.240
change the bible.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.960
I mean have you read the contemporary English version?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.200
The prose is atrocious, appalling.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.440
I won't stand for this.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.280
But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more

08:50.280 --> 08:52.440
than just a political and legal dispute.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.880
It seems to me that whatever Church, State, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already

08:56.880 --> 08:58.840
are and will continue to be women.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.760
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime

09:03.760 --> 09:05.320
rival Blair White.

09:05.320 --> 09:09.720
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.

09:09.720 --> 09:14.080
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used

09:14.080 --> 09:17.520
to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.800
Blair responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
impractical.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.880
Well if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were

09:26.880 --> 09:31.200
meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt, and you

09:31.200 --> 09:35.440
had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair, and they said okay,

09:35.440 --> 09:39.720
and you had to describe me to take me to the table, um, you wouldn't say the man in the

09:39.720 --> 09:42.240
orange shirt, you would say Blair, you would say her over there.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.640
Ben then responds saying, I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that

09:45.640 --> 09:49.880
there is a utility to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same as suggesting

09:49.880 --> 09:53.360
that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.800
And Blair responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.

09:56.800 --> 10:01.440
For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them

10:01.440 --> 10:04.800
that kid's parents, because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link

10:04.800 --> 10:09.520
at all biologically, but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.160
Let's expand on that analogy.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.640
Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted

10:14.640 --> 10:18.360
child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.720
As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings

10:22.720 --> 10:24.120
forth offspring.

10:24.120 --> 10:29.080
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.960
Facts don't care about your feelings.

10:30.960 --> 10:35.760
No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.360
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being

10:40.360 --> 10:44.000
provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.040
But they're not just impolite.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.100
They're also wrong.

10:48.100 --> 10:53.400
Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological

10:53.400 --> 10:57.840
parent, and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.480
So what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

11:00.480 --> 11:03.840
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological

11:03.840 --> 11:04.840
parents, right?

11:04.840 --> 11:08.120
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents,

11:08.120 --> 11:09.880
but we do say adoptive parents.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.880
Right.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.880
Adoptive parents.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.920
An entirely valid type of parent.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.720
To call them parents is not a lie.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.940
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly as the context that you were suggesting matters,

11:21.940 --> 11:23.580
in what context are we talking about the parents?

11:23.580 --> 11:24.820
Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

11:24.820 --> 11:29.260
Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has

11:29.260 --> 11:30.260
two aspects, right?

11:30.260 --> 11:33.940
There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.

11:33.940 --> 11:38.140
So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and

11:38.140 --> 11:39.140
adoptive parents.

11:39.140 --> 11:43.380
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need

11:43.380 --> 11:45.740
to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

11:45.740 --> 11:50.660
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.

11:50.660 --> 11:54.380
In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological

11:54.380 --> 11:58.260
role of woman, which you are not, and then there is the, you look like a woman, which

11:58.260 --> 12:01.960
is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.

12:01.960 --> 12:06.300
Just when Ben seems on the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument

12:06.300 --> 12:09.860
to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

12:09.860 --> 12:14.620
From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind

12:14.620 --> 12:15.620
of ugly.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.620
You know what I mean?

12:16.620 --> 12:17.620
Yeah.

12:17.620 --> 12:18.620
There was the, I think the person's name was Zoe Tur.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.620
There was the threat of physical violence.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.420
What are your genetics, sir?

12:22.420 --> 12:25.020
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.860
Yeah, I mean what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that

12:28.860 --> 12:32.940
I'm saying to you right now is exactly what I said to Zoe Tur on the air.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.660
But that's not exactly true, is it Ben?

12:35.660 --> 12:37.820
Zoe threatened you after you called her sir.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.700
And you didn't call Blair sir, did you?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.460
Why did you call Zoe sir?

12:42.460 --> 12:47.620
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

12:47.620 --> 12:50.300
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.860
I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.

12:53.860 --> 12:59.420
Queen Guinevere said in days of old, I knight thee Lancelot, thou that art care-y-o-typically

12:59.420 --> 13:00.420
male.

13:00.420 --> 13:04.220
And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F-you,

13:04.220 --> 13:06.020
that's not a great way to change my mind.

13:06.020 --> 13:07.740
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

13:07.740 --> 13:11.140
So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?

13:11.140 --> 13:16.980
Did Blair budge you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

13:16.980 --> 13:18.900
It doesn't seem like she did.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.180
At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.300
You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site, and my basic rule is that when we're

13:26.300 --> 13:29.420
discussing people who are trans, we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman and

13:29.420 --> 13:34.260
then refer to them by their biological pronoun, because biology is the nature of the pronouns.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.460
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

13:36.460 --> 13:40.500
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?

13:40.500 --> 13:43.020
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

13:43.020 --> 13:47.140
There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and

13:47.140 --> 13:48.660
biological parents.

13:48.660 --> 13:53.140
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish

13:53.140 --> 13:58.060
between transgender and cisgender, or as you say, biological women.

13:58.060 --> 14:02.020
For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive healthcare you think

14:02.020 --> 14:03.180
should be illegal.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.220
But does this apply to pronouns?

14:05.220 --> 14:10.820
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes, or are they part

14:10.820 --> 14:13.900
of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?

14:13.900 --> 14:15.820
The answer is obvious.

14:15.820 --> 14:18.220
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

14:18.220 --> 14:22.700
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between a

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
he and a she.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.220
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

14:27.220 --> 14:32.420
This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.

14:32.420 --> 14:37.260
So as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

14:37.260 --> 14:41.980
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy, which is

14:41.980 --> 14:46.100
none of your business Ben Shapiro, fascinating though it is.

14:46.100 --> 14:50.580
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child, to call

14:50.580 --> 14:56.020
me he is not just rude or insensitive, it is, in effect, false.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.940
But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still

15:00.940 --> 15:01.940
not.

15:01.940 --> 15:02.940
What's the harm, right?

15:02.940 --> 15:07.060
If I teach my almost four year old girl that she can become a boy, then I think that is

15:07.060 --> 15:10.140
not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.260
Oh yes, the classic argument.

15:12.260 --> 15:14.500
How do I explain to my child?

15:14.500 --> 15:18.100
Kill your shitty child for all I care, that's simply not my problem.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.380
I regret every night I spent with you Ben Shapiro.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.140
I'm in a new relationship now, with a lesbian.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.620
You and I are through.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.020
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

15:33.340 --> 15:36.620
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

15:36.620 --> 15:41.420
I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.060
Or maybe an orgy.

15:43.060 --> 15:46.540
But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.

15:46.540 --> 15:51.580
The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell

15:51.580 --> 15:54.420
bent on destroying western civilization.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.340
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

15:58.340 --> 16:04.620
Hi boys, it's points again.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.620
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

16:06.620 --> 16:10.860
In my previous video, Nasty T-Babe Likes It Rough, I made an argument about why it's

16:10.860 --> 16:15.100
correct to call trans women she, but I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully

16:15.100 --> 16:17.300
integrated binary trans people.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.940
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

16:19.940 --> 16:24.540
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering

16:24.540 --> 16:25.540
them.

16:26.540 --> 16:31.460
I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:31.460 --> 16:32.460
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:32.460 --> 16:40.220
I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look, because

16:40.220 --> 16:44.420
cis people have an easier time making sense of that, but the reality is that in a lot

16:44.420 --> 16:46.780
of cases, it's a little more complicated.

16:46.780 --> 16:51.940
Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.

16:51.940 --> 16:54.100
Everybody basically gets that I'm a woman.

16:54.100 --> 16:59.220
Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

16:59.220 --> 17:02.100
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?

17:02.100 --> 17:04.540
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.780
I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

17:07.780 --> 17:13.340
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M, but needless to say it was a desperate emergency,

17:13.340 --> 17:17.420
and by emergency I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's, and what happened next

17:17.420 --> 17:22.140
stays between me and the Lord, but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched

17:22.140 --> 17:23.140
in-

17:23.140 --> 17:26.260
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.420
He wasn't cute.

17:27.420 --> 17:32.620
So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking I try to pass off as my voice, and

17:32.620 --> 17:36.900
my tragic inability to conduct myself in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,

17:36.900 --> 17:41.660
your girl remains, despite my desperate, painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.420
You look great, hun.

17:44.220 --> 17:48.180
In that debate between Ben and Blair, Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what

17:48.180 --> 17:49.180
you look like.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.980
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

17:51.980 --> 17:56.740
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.

17:56.740 --> 18:00.500
So appearance definitely matters, but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking

18:00.500 --> 18:03.740
like a cis woman, is really the most important thing.

18:03.740 --> 18:09.060
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off, the way you speak, the gestures,

18:09.060 --> 18:10.820
the conversational dynamic.

18:10.820 --> 18:15.140
That kind of stuff, to me, is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

18:15.140 --> 18:20.980
So my goal isn't necessarily to serve unclockable fish, so much as to embody a certain kind

18:20.980 --> 18:23.940
of diaphanous archetypal femininity.

18:23.940 --> 18:26.100
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.300
Also I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank god.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.300
Last month I released a video called Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe, and a lot

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying that performing your

18:37.300 --> 18:40.900
gender is the only thing that matters, and that how you identify counts for nothing.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.580
But that's not what I think.

18:42.580 --> 18:47.500
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,

18:47.500 --> 18:51.580
because I think that's a much more compelling argument than I'm a woman because I psychologically

18:51.580 --> 18:55.700
identify as a woman, which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.380
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

18:57.380 --> 19:01.620
But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns, and I'll explain why.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.260
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive about anyone

19:07.260 --> 19:11.940
telling them what pronouns to use, so I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings

19:11.940 --> 19:15.680
and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.980
After all, we live in a repressive political era, despite the best efforts of hero professor

19:19.980 --> 19:20.980
Jordan B. Peterson.

19:20.980 --> 19:26.660
But alas, he was too late, now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people

19:26.660 --> 19:30.620
to jail for- oh it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?

19:30.620 --> 19:34.540
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.

19:35.540 --> 19:46.540
🎵sad music🎵

19:46.540 --> 19:51.340
Oh, guess that, uh, guess that was a false alarm, huh?

19:51.340 --> 19:53.020
God, goddammit.

19:53.020 --> 19:57.060
Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use, I'm just gonna tell you how

19:57.060 --> 20:01.700
I use pronouns and my reasoning behind it, and you are welcome to use your free speech

20:01.700 --> 20:06.100
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be, okay?

20:06.100 --> 20:07.900
So, back to identity.

20:07.900 --> 20:13.980
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets, and a customer were to walk in looking

20:13.980 --> 20:20.020
like this, I might ordinarily default to female pronouns, but that would be wrong, since I

20:20.020 --> 20:26.260
happen to know this person is not only a man, he is THE man, YouTube's most regal makeup

20:26.260 --> 20:31.260
artist, his lordship John McClane, and he uses he-him pronouns.

20:31.260 --> 20:35.860
Likewise, if I were approached by this person, I'd fall in love and then default to female

20:35.860 --> 20:41.380
pronouns, and this time I'd be correct, but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

20:41.380 --> 20:45.700
but because she's gender-fluid drag queen Courtney Act, who has the fucking audacity

20:45.700 --> 20:50.020
to be a more beautiful woman than I am, and who so far as I know uses male pronouns in

20:50.020 --> 20:53.820
boy mode and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

20:53.820 --> 20:58.260
A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression get played out in

20:58.260 --> 20:59.540
the world of drag.

20:59.540 --> 21:04.780
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men, who live as men and perform as women.

21:04.780 --> 21:10.060
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon, Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke,

21:10.060 --> 21:11.540
identify as non-binary.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.100
Others still are bio-queens, cis women who perform as drag queens, like Lucy Garland

21:16.100 --> 21:17.100
or Creme Fatale.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.780
And then there are trans women who are also drag queens, like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or

21:21.780 --> 21:22.780
for that matter, me.

21:22.780 --> 21:27.740
I mean look at me, do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-Eleven at 2am?

21:27.740 --> 21:28.740
Because I do.

21:28.740 --> 21:29.740
Look what I've become.

21:29.740 --> 21:32.180
A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

21:32.180 --> 21:36.620
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake, I just through pure coincidence

21:36.620 --> 21:40.620
happened to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived, I'm so sorry, I can't

21:40.620 --> 21:41.620
help it.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.620
So let's recap.

21:42.620 --> 21:46.540
There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.

21:46.540 --> 21:50.180
There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.

21:50.180 --> 21:54.420
There are genderfluid people who use different pronouns depending on their current presentation.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.180
There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender other than the one they

21:58.180 --> 22:01.060
present and live as and prefer other pronouns.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.460
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks, because there's a lot of

22:04.460 --> 22:07.900
situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

22:07.900 --> 22:13.500
So as you can see, identity definitely is important, but it's also not the only thing

22:13.500 --> 22:14.500
that matters.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.500
If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered, then there would be no need

22:18.500 --> 22:23.180
for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition, including requesting different

22:23.180 --> 22:28.260
pronouns, because pronouns belong to the social world of language, not to individual

22:28.260 --> 22:29.260
psychology.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.860
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

22:32.860 --> 22:38.260
You can identify however you like, but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

22:38.260 --> 22:43.420
So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man, then you are fully

22:43.420 --> 22:48.300
trans, your identity is fully valid, but until you begin living as a woman, your womanhood

22:48.300 --> 22:50.300
remains kind of hypothetical.

22:50.420 --> 22:53.660
And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.

22:53.660 --> 22:58.740
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance, and not enough on social relationships.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.500
You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.340
You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

23:05.340 --> 23:06.340
and says,

23:06.340 --> 23:07.880
Maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.340
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

23:10.340 --> 23:14.180
As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet, they are fully

23:14.180 --> 23:15.180
trans.

23:15.180 --> 23:19.180
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience

23:19.500 --> 23:21.660
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

23:21.660 --> 23:26.060
Put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman, but my thought

23:26.060 --> 23:28.820
process behind it isn't always the same.

23:28.820 --> 23:33.780
Many trans women just seem like women to me, in literally the same way that cis women seem

23:33.780 --> 23:37.780
like women, and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to

23:37.780 --> 23:38.780
do from birth.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.980
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

23:41.980 --> 23:46.700
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly, but at least to seem like our genders to the

23:46.700 --> 23:47.980
people around us.

23:47.980 --> 23:52.180
As Laura Jane Grace put it, you want them to see you like they see every other girl.

23:52.180 --> 23:56.380
I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity

23:56.380 --> 23:57.780
AS A TRANS WOMAN

23:57.780 --> 24:00.420
but just because I seem like a woman to them.

24:00.420 --> 24:06.700
Because the reality is, not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,

24:06.700 --> 24:11.380
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

24:11.380 --> 24:15.580
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen, and I cope with that fear by looking

24:15.580 --> 24:17.460
like a second-rate drag queen.

24:17.460 --> 24:22.460
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a 0% woman, if she tells me she's

24:22.460 --> 24:26.660
a trans woman, I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

24:26.660 --> 24:31.700
Not just to be polite, but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological

24:31.700 --> 24:36.700
experience, and especially because I want to help her re-socialize and reintegrate into

24:36.700 --> 24:38.540
the world as her true gender.

24:38.540 --> 24:43.820
And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that, but if you

24:43.820 --> 24:46.740
refuse, you are being a shit gibbon.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.340
And I would prefer that you not be a shit gibbon.

24:49.340 --> 24:52.540
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

24:52.540 --> 24:57.380
An increasing number of people identify not as male or female, but as non-binary, an umbrella

24:57.380 --> 25:02.500
term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.220
greygender, and so on.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.580
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.420
In English, usually they.

25:08.420 --> 25:12.420
Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense, consider

25:12.420 --> 25:17.140
that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all is a particular feature of

25:17.140 --> 25:21.700
the English language that's by no means shared by all other languages, including Turkish,

25:21.700 --> 25:24.420
Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.

25:24.420 --> 25:27.220
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth that humans make

25:27.220 --> 25:28.740
up to suit our purposes.

25:28.740 --> 25:32.420
If you're new to using singular they, it is a little confusing at first, but with some

25:32.420 --> 25:34.260
practice it gets pretty easy.

25:34.260 --> 25:38.940
They poured milk on me, I poured milk on them, they did anoint themselves in their milk and

25:38.940 --> 25:40.900
it was good, thus saith the Lord.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.820
So the polite thing to do here is easy.

25:42.820 --> 25:46.260
If someone asks you to call them they, you call them they.

25:46.260 --> 25:50.500
But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing because you dogmatically believe

25:50.500 --> 25:52.020
it's the woke thing to do.

25:52.020 --> 25:54.340
You want to understand why you're doing it.

25:54.340 --> 25:58.660
I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people, I want to be a convert.

25:58.660 --> 26:02.780
I want to believe about them what they believe about themselves, so long as those beliefs

26:02.780 --> 26:03.780
are reasonable.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.620
So what do all these words mean?

26:05.620 --> 26:07.380
What are these people talking about?

26:07.380 --> 26:10.700
Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.

26:10.700 --> 26:15.700
John McClane is feminine in expression but a man in identity, whereas I am a woman in

26:15.700 --> 26:18.740
identity and in expression I am a mess.

26:18.740 --> 26:24.060
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity, art, science,

26:24.060 --> 26:27.580
spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.

26:27.580 --> 26:32.220
The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10, or high

26:32.220 --> 26:37.140
femme to stone butch, the gender expression of a given domain, such as Mulan looks or

26:37.140 --> 26:38.460
Steven Universe characters.

26:38.860 --> 26:44.140
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.

26:44.140 --> 26:48.580
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender, greygender,

26:48.580 --> 26:53.780
and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity the Futch scale gives

26:53.780 --> 26:54.780
to expression.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.460
But my input on this isn't really worth that much, because I'm not non-binary.

26:58.460 --> 27:02.900
And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here because all this talk

27:02.900 --> 27:07.460
about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.

27:07.460 --> 27:11.460
I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

27:11.460 --> 27:15.820
And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.

27:15.820 --> 27:17.620
And that's how I experience gender.

27:17.620 --> 27:22.540
I live, I exist, as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve the same level of sadness

27:22.540 --> 27:24.580
and dysfunction as everyone else.

27:24.580 --> 27:26.780
And I identify as trash.

27:26.780 --> 27:31.100
I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman, oh, listening

27:31.100 --> 27:36.260
to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration, waiting in a long-ass line for

27:36.260 --> 27:41.140
the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist, being asked if I have any tampons,

27:41.140 --> 27:46.460
having tampons in case someone asks, a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me, and me going

27:46.460 --> 27:49.100
oh really, wow.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.920
But you know these experiences mean different things to different people, so all I can really

27:52.920 --> 27:58.700
tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures, that taking

27:58.700 --> 28:02.740
female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures makes me feel more at home in my

28:02.740 --> 28:07.700
body, and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman, socially, spiritually,

28:07.700 --> 28:08.700
sexually.

28:08.700 --> 28:11.500
So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender as I see it.

28:11.500 --> 28:16.420
Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?

28:16.420 --> 28:19.420
Well honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.

28:19.420 --> 28:25.220
But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have, and that, I think,

28:25.220 --> 28:26.580
is legitimate enough.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.940
So I know what living as a woman means to me, but what does it mean to live a non-binary

28:30.940 --> 28:31.940
life?

28:32.140 --> 28:35.140
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman, that's something that's going

28:35.140 --> 28:37.780
to vary between individuals and cultures.

28:37.780 --> 28:42.300
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions, such as the Hidra of South Asia, a legally

28:42.300 --> 28:47.380
recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, or the various two-spirit

28:47.380 --> 28:50.620
traditions of indigenous North American tribes.

28:50.620 --> 28:54.740
Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition, but we do have individual

28:54.740 --> 28:59.340
non-binary people, some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary

28:59.340 --> 29:02.780
experience, non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

29:02.780 --> 29:06.260
We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.

29:06.260 --> 29:11.260
Even as a binary trans person, I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.

29:11.260 --> 29:15.460
That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.

29:15.460 --> 29:19.180
But many of the people who call themselves non-binary seem to be fighting for something

29:19.180 --> 29:22.780
more radical than what I'm fighting for, at least in my personal life.

29:22.780 --> 29:28.060
I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.420
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.740
The traditional female carp of my culture.

29:32.740 --> 29:35.420
Nier nier nier nier nier nier nier.

29:35.420 --> 29:36.780
No!

29:36.780 --> 29:41.260
Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely, they're effectively

29:41.260 --> 29:44.480
trying to create the society that includes them.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.140
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people who, for example,

29:49.140 --> 29:52.220
promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

29:52.220 --> 29:57.060
Whereas I love it when people assume my gender, provided they assume it correctly.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.700
Otherwise I will throw you in imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

30:00.700 --> 30:05.620
But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people

30:05.620 --> 30:10.140
find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro

30:10.140 --> 30:11.260
wants you to use.

30:11.260 --> 30:14.140
So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.

30:14.140 --> 30:20.020
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer, to do or say anything, I do hope you

30:20.020 --> 30:25.380
use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.380
Freely.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.060
Freely.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.060
Freely.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.060
Freely.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.060
Freely.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.060
Freely.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.060
Freely.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.060
Freely.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.580
Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

30:36.580 --> 30:40.540
I'm talking about the female lead.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.280
Now the fun really begins.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
The show's over.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.300
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.860
So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

30:48.860 --> 30:54.200
Until next week, go to hell!

30:54.400 --> 31:05.400
You can't make me you.

31:05.400 --> 31:13.400
You can't make that true.

31:13.400 --> 31:22.400
This is who I am.

31:22.400 --> 31:33.600
We'll go hand in hand in hand in hand.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.600
We'll go hand in hand in hand.
