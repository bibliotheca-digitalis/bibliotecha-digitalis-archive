1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Death, death, death, death, death, is the only thing everyone fears.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,120
And the only thing that gets me off.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello, my devilish darlings.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,240
I am Lenora LeVay, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,560
Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,920
The story is rather simple, really.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,280
The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
them.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,920
And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,480
health care, and video games for lesbians.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,160
But there's one man who stands in the way, the villain of tonight's thriller, a meddling

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:18,200
little cipher of a man, a man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
to chaos.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,600
Can you imagine?

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,360
His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,600
Can our heroine put a stop to this?

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Well, I'm just the executioner.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,160
You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:09,040
Hi girls, it's me, Ms. Points, Mademoiselle Poin.

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,200
Words, words, words, what do they even fucking mean?

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,760
Well, I don't know, and I don't care, but we have to talk about it anyway, because of

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,480
a boy named Ben Shapiro.

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,280
So who is Ben Shapiro?

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,840
Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of the Daily Wire, and the auteur

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,480
behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben

26
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,200
Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,720
Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,600
Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,240
refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
a she.

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,120
It's surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
And let's be civil, right?

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
That's the tone of the day.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm a fan.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,880
But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on

37
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
his edgier mantra,

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
Facts don't care about your feelings.

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,120
And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,000
It's true, facts don't care about my feelings.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,440
I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition,

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,600
This makes me feel invalidated.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,120
Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad, are true.

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,200
It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling abs, but too fucking

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,160
bad for me, because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
at forever.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,400
Mm, I was a yum-yum though.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,780
Build me a time machine, doc.

49
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,280
We call this auto-androphilia, nurse.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
What can I say?

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I like younger men.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm a cougar.

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
In tiger's clothing.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,960
So look, I want to be treated like an adult.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
I don't want to be indulged.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,480
If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,360
I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
tell myself to make it through the night.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,200
It's probably just dry down there, they're just ingrown hairs.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,520
I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,920
of course false and heathen religions.

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,320
I am an evangelical transsexual.

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want toleration, dammit.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want converts.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Excuse me, sir.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Do you have a moment to talk about my woman head?

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Sure.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Go ahead.

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Touch it.

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
So look, Shapiro.

72
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Benny.

73
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Baby.

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,360
I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales.

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,800
To melt away every crystal of my snowflakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
tea.

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Alright, big boy?

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
Let's have it.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner.

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she.

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Because you can't change her sex.

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
You can change her name.

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Caitlyn Jenner is a man.

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
A biological man.

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,600
And if he were born with a high dosage of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
not be a woman.

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Right.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You are determined by your chromosomes.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,680
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
that is, XX sex chromosomes.

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,640
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,400
be tantamount to a lie.

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,960
I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't let a transgender

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
like woman be called she or something.

95
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
Because it is a lie.

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,720
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means

97
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,600
to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,540
woman she, we are saying that she has a normal female karyotype.

99
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,920
But hold on, I'm a transgender woman and I've never claimed to have a normal female karyotype,

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,200
and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend,

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,720
ladies, good girl, good girl, just like that, don't stop, don't stop.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Are all of us deluded about my biology?

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
No.

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,680
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro, it is you who misunderstands language.

105
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,240
You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
We all agree on the biology.

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,360
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man, and woman.

108
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,520
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,240
Well there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,840
If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,080
and study the way a word, for instance she, is used by a linguistic community, and whatever

112
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,480
the social convention is is what's correct.

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,280
But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way

114
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,000
the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority such as the dictionary,

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,760
or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy, or we must have some goal that we want to

116
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,920
accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Now if we take the descriptive approach, you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
me she, and that's all there is to it.

119
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,640
What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical, you don't put an article

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
before a pronoun.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,840
That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.

122
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,760
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,320
she originate in the Proto-Germanic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,760
Europe beginning around 500 BCE.

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,960
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,160
refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,800
tradition, Ben Shapiro.

128
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,360
However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,160
So let's try out a prescriptive approach.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,880
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,000
should be used?

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,960
Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated

133
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,400
by political goals.

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,160
reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women

136
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,240
she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,600
of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,440
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.

139
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Opponents argued the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,080
man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed because… it's the definition.

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,400
And on the other hand, gay people argued that the definition should be changed, because

143
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,400
they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

144
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,400
And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of

145
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
words.

146
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,240
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the bible, and for that matter you can

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
change the bible.

148
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,960
I mean have you read the contemporary English version?

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,200
The prose is atrocious, appalling.

150
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,440
I won't stand for this.

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,280
But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more

152
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,440
than just a political and legal dispute.

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,880
It seems to me that whatever Church, State, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already

154
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,840
are and will continue to be women.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,760
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime

156
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,320
rival Blair White.

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,080
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,520
to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,800
Blair responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
impractical.

162
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
Well if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,200
meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt, and you

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair, and they said okay,

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,720
and you had to describe me to take me to the table, um, you wouldn't say the man in the

166
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,240
orange shirt, you would say Blair, you would say her over there.

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,640
Ben then responds saying, I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,880
there is a utility to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same as suggesting

169
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,360
that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.

170
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
And Blair responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.

171
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,440
For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
that kid's parents, because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link

173
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,520
at all biologically, but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.

174
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Let's expand on that analogy.

175
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted

176
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,360
child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,720
As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings

178
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
forth offspring.

179
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,080
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.

180
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
Facts don't care about your feelings.

181
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,760
No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

182
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,360
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,000
provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,040
But they're not just impolite.

185
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,100
They're also wrong.

186
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,400
Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological

187
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,840
parent, and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,480
So what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

189
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,840
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological

190
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
parents, right?

191
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,120
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents,

192
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,880
but we do say adoptive parents.

193
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Right.

194
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Adoptive parents.

195
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,920
An entirely valid type of parent.

196
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
To call them parents is not a lie.

197
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,940
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly as the context that you were suggesting matters,

198
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,580
in what context are we talking about the parents?

199
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,820
Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

200
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,260
Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has

201
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
two aspects, right?

202
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,940
There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.

203
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,140
So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and

204
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
adoptive parents.

205
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,380
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need

206
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,740
to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

207
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,660
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.

208
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,380
In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological

209
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,260
role of woman, which you are not, and then there is the, you look like a woman, which

210
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,960
is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.

211
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,300
Just when Ben seems on the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument

212
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,860
to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

213
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,620
From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind

214
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
of ugly.

215
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
You know what I mean?

216
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Yeah.

217
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,620
There was the, I think the person's name was Zoe Tur.

218
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
There was the threat of physical violence.

219
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,420
What are your genetics, sir?

220
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,020
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

221
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,860
Yeah, I mean what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that

222
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm saying to you right now is exactly what I said to Zoe Tur on the air.

223
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,660
But that's not exactly true, is it Ben?

224
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,820
Zoe threatened you after you called her sir.

225
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,700
And you didn't call Blair sir, did you?

226
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,460
Why did you call Zoe sir?

227
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,620
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

228
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,300
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

229
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,860
I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.

230
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,420
Queen Guinevere said in days of old, I knight thee Lancelot, thou that art care-y-o-typically

231
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
male.

232
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,220
And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F-you,

233
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,020
that's not a great way to change my mind.

234
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,740
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

235
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,140
So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?

236
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,980
Did Blair budge you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

237
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,900
It doesn't seem like she did.

238
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,180
At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.

239
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,300
You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site, and my basic rule is that when we're

240
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,420
discussing people who are trans, we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman and

241
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,260
then refer to them by their biological pronoun, because biology is the nature of the pronouns.

242
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,460
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

243
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,500
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?

244
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,020
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

245
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,140
There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and

246
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,660
biological parents.

247
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,140
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish

248
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,060
between transgender and cisgender, or as you say, biological women.

249
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,020
For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive healthcare you think

250
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,180
should be illegal.

251
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,220
But does this apply to pronouns?

252
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,820
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes, or are they part

253
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,900
of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?

254
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,820
The answer is obvious.

255
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,220
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

256
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,700
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between a

257
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
he and a she.

258
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,220
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

259
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,420
This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.

260
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,260
So as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

261
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,980
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy, which is

262
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,100
none of your business Ben Shapiro, fascinating though it is.

263
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,580
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child, to call

264
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,020
me he is not just rude or insensitive, it is, in effect, false.

265
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,940
But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still

266
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
not.

267
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
What's the harm, right?

268
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,060
If I teach my almost four year old girl that she can become a boy, then I think that is

269
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,140
not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

270
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,260
Oh yes, the classic argument.

271
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,500
How do I explain to my child?

272
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,100
Kill your shitty child for all I care, that's simply not my problem.

273
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,380
I regret every night I spent with you Ben Shapiro.

274
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,140
I'm in a new relationship now, with a lesbian.

275
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,620
You and I are through.

276
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,020
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

277
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,620
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

278
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,420
I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.

279
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,060
Or maybe an orgy.

280
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,540
But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.

281
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,580
The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell

282
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,420
bent on destroying western civilization.

283
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,340
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

284
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,620
Hi boys, it's points again.

285
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

286
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,860
In my previous video, Nasty T-Babe Likes It Rough, I made an argument about why it's

287
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,100
correct to call trans women she, but I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully

288
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,300
integrated binary trans people.

289
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,940
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

290
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,540
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering

291
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
them.

292
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,460
I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

293
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

294
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:40,220
I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look, because

295
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,420
cis people have an easier time making sense of that, but the reality is that in a lot

296
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,780
of cases, it's a little more complicated.

297
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,940
Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.

298
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,100
Everybody basically gets that I'm a woman.

299
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,220
Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

300
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,100
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?

301
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,540
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

302
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,780
I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

303
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,340
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M, but needless to say it was a desperate emergency,

304
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,420
and by emergency I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's, and what happened next

305
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,140
stays between me and the Lord, but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched

306
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
in-

307
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,260
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

308
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,420
He wasn't cute.

309
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,620
So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking I try to pass off as my voice, and

310
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,900
my tragic inability to conduct myself in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,

311
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,660
your girl remains, despite my desperate, painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.

312
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,420
You look great, hun.

313
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,180
In that debate between Ben and Blair, Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what

314
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,180
you look like.

315
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,980
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

316
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,740
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.

317
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,500
So appearance definitely matters, but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking

318
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,740
like a cis woman, is really the most important thing.

319
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,060
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off, the way you speak, the gestures,

320
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,820
the conversational dynamic.

321
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,140
That kind of stuff, to me, is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

322
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,980
So my goal isn't necessarily to serve unclockable fish, so much as to embody a certain kind

323
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,940
of diaphanous archetypal femininity.

324
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,100
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

325
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,300
Also I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank god.

326
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Last month I released a video called Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe, and a lot

327
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying that performing your

328
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,900
gender is the only thing that matters, and that how you identify counts for nothing.

329
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,580
But that's not what I think.

330
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,500
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,

331
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,580
because I think that's a much more compelling argument than I'm a woman because I psychologically

332
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,700
identify as a woman, which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.

333
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,380
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

334
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,620
But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns, and I'll explain why.

335
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,260
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive about anyone

336
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,940
telling them what pronouns to use, so I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings

337
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,680
and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.

338
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,980
After all, we live in a repressive political era, despite the best efforts of hero professor

339
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Jordan B. Peterson.

340
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,660
But alas, he was too late, now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people

341
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,620
to jail for- oh it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?

342
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,540
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.

343
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:46,540
🎵sad music🎵

344
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,340
Oh, guess that, uh, guess that was a false alarm, huh?

345
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,020
God, goddammit.

346
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,060
Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use, I'm just gonna tell you how

347
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,700
I use pronouns and my reasoning behind it, and you are welcome to use your free speech

348
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,100
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be, okay?

349
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,900
So, back to identity.

350
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,980
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets, and a customer were to walk in looking

351
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,020
like this, I might ordinarily default to female pronouns, but that would be wrong, since I

352
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:26,260
happen to know this person is not only a man, he is THE man, YouTube's most regal makeup

353
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,260
artist, his lordship John McClane, and he uses he-him pronouns.

354
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,860
Likewise, if I were approached by this person, I'd fall in love and then default to female

355
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,380
pronouns, and this time I'd be correct, but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

356
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,700
but because she's gender-fluid drag queen Courtney Act, who has the fucking audacity

357
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,020
to be a more beautiful woman than I am, and who so far as I know uses male pronouns in

358
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,820
boy mode and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

359
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,260
A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression get played out in

360
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,540
the world of drag.

361
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,780
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men, who live as men and perform as women.

362
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,060
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon, Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke,

363
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,540
identify as non-binary.

364
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,100
Others still are bio-queens, cis women who perform as drag queens, like Lucy Garland

365
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
or Creme Fatale.

366
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,780
And then there are trans women who are also drag queens, like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or

367
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
for that matter, me.

368
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,740
I mean look at me, do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-Eleven at 2am?

369
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Because I do.

370
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Look what I've become.

371
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,180
A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

372
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,620
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake, I just through pure coincidence

373
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,620
happened to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived, I'm so sorry, I can't

374
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
help it.

375
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
So let's recap.

376
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,540
There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.

377
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,180
There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.

378
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,420
There are genderfluid people who use different pronouns depending on their current presentation.

379
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,180
There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender other than the one they

380
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,060
present and live as and prefer other pronouns.

381
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,460
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks, because there's a lot of

382
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,900
situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

383
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,500
So as you can see, identity definitely is important, but it's also not the only thing

384
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
that matters.

385
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered, then there would be no need

386
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,180
for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition, including requesting different

387
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,260
pronouns, because pronouns belong to the social world of language, not to individual

388
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
psychology.

389
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,860
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

390
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,260
You can identify however you like, but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

391
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,420
So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man, then you are fully

392
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,300
trans, your identity is fully valid, but until you begin living as a woman, your womanhood

393
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
remains kind of hypothetical.

394
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,660
And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.

395
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,740
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance, and not enough on social relationships.

396
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,500
You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.

397
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,340
You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

398
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
and says,

399
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,880
Maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

400
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,340
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

401
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,180
As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet, they are fully

402
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
trans.

403
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,180
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience

404
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,660
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

405
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,060
Put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman, but my thought

406
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,820
process behind it isn't always the same.

407
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,780
Many trans women just seem like women to me, in literally the same way that cis women seem

408
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,780
like women, and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to

409
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,780
do from birth.

410
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,980
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

411
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,700
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly, but at least to seem like our genders to the

412
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,980
people around us.

413
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,180
As Laura Jane Grace put it, you want them to see you like they see every other girl.

414
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,380
I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity

415
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,780
AS A TRANS WOMAN

416
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,420
but just because I seem like a woman to them.

417
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,700
Because the reality is, not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,

418
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,380
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

419
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen, and I cope with that fear by looking

420
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,460
like a second-rate drag queen.

421
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,460
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a 0% woman, if she tells me she's

422
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,660
a trans woman, I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

423
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,700
Not just to be polite, but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological

424
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,700
experience, and especially because I want to help her re-socialize and reintegrate into

425
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,540
the world as her true gender.

426
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,820
And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that, but if you

427
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,740
refuse, you are being a shit gibbon.

428
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,340
And I would prefer that you not be a shit gibbon.

429
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,540
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

430
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,380
An increasing number of people identify not as male or female, but as non-binary, an umbrella

431
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,500
term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,

432
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,220
greygender, and so on.

433
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,580
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

434
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,420
In English, usually they.

435
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,420
Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense, consider

436
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,140
that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all is a particular feature of

437
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,700
the English language that's by no means shared by all other languages, including Turkish,

438
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,420
Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.

439
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,220
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth that humans make

440
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,740
up to suit our purposes.

441
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,420
If you're new to using singular they, it is a little confusing at first, but with some

442
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,260
practice it gets pretty easy.

443
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,940
They poured milk on me, I poured milk on them, they did anoint themselves in their milk and

444
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,900
it was good, thus saith the Lord.

445
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,820
So the polite thing to do here is easy.

446
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,260
If someone asks you to call them they, you call them they.

447
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,500
But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing because you dogmatically believe

448
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,020
it's the woke thing to do.

449
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,340
You want to understand why you're doing it.

450
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,660
I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people, I want to be a convert.

451
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,780
I want to believe about them what they believe about themselves, so long as those beliefs

452
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
are reasonable.

453
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,620
So what do all these words mean?

454
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,380
What are these people talking about?

455
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,700
Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.

456
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,700
John McClane is feminine in expression but a man in identity, whereas I am a woman in

457
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,740
identity and in expression I am a mess.

458
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,060
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity, art, science,

459
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,580
spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.

460
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,220
The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10, or high

461
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:37,140
femme to stone butch, the gender expression of a given domain, such as Mulan looks or

462
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,460
Steven Universe characters.

463
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,140
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.

464
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,580
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender, greygender,

465
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,780
and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity the Futch scale gives

466
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
to expression.

467
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,460
But my input on this isn't really worth that much, because I'm not non-binary.

468
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,900
And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here because all this talk

469
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,460
about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.

470
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,460
I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?

471
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,820
And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.

472
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,620
And that's how I experience gender.

473
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,540
I live, I exist, as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve the same level of sadness

474
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,580
and dysfunction as everyone else.

475
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,780
And I identify as trash.

476
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,100
I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman, oh, listening

477
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,260
to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration, waiting in a long-ass line for

478
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,140
the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist, being asked if I have any tampons,

479
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,460
having tampons in case someone asks, a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me, and me going

480
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,100
oh really, wow.

481
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,920
But you know these experiences mean different things to different people, so all I can really

482
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,700
tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures, that taking

483
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,740
female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures makes me feel more at home in my

484
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,700
body, and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman, socially, spiritually,

485
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
sexually.

486
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,500
So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender as I see it.

487
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,420
Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?

488
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Well honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.

489
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,220
But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have, and that, I think,

490
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,580
is legitimate enough.

491
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,940
So I know what living as a woman means to me, but what does it mean to live a non-binary

492
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
life?

493
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman, that's something that's going

494
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,780
to vary between individuals and cultures.

495
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,300
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions, such as the Hidra of South Asia, a legally

496
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,380
recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, or the various two-spirit

497
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,620
traditions of indigenous North American tribes.

498
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,740
Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition, but we do have individual

499
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,340
non-binary people, some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary

500
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,780
experience, non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

501
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,260
We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.

502
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,260
Even as a binary trans person, I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.

503
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,460
That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.

504
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,180
But many of the people who call themselves non-binary seem to be fighting for something

505
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,780
more radical than what I'm fighting for, at least in my personal life.

506
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:28,060
I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.

507
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,420
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.

508
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,740
The traditional female carp of my culture.

509
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,420
Nier nier nier nier nier nier nier.

510
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,780
No!

511
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,260
Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely, they're effectively

512
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,480
trying to create the society that includes them.

513
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,140
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people who, for example,

514
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,220
promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

515
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,060
Whereas I love it when people assume my gender, provided they assume it correctly.

516
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,700
Otherwise I will throw you in imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

517
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,620
But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people

518
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,140
find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro

519
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,260
wants you to use.

520
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,140
So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.

521
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:20,020
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer, to do or say anything, I do hope you

522
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:25,380
use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.

523
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Freely.

524
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Freely.

525
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Freely.

526
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Freely.

527
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,060
Freely.

528
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Freely.

529
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Freely.

530
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Freely.

531
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,580
Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

532
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,540
I'm talking about the female lead.

533
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,280
Now the fun really begins.

534
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
The show's over.

535
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,300
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.

536
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,860
So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

537
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,200
Until next week, go to hell!

538
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:05,400
You can't make me you.

539
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:13,400
You can't make that true.

540
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:22,400
This is who I am.

541
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:33,600
We'll go hand in hand in hand in hand.

542
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,600
We'll go hand in hand in hand.
