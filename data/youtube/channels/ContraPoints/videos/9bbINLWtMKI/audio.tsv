0	29960	Death, death, death, death, death, is the only thing everyone fears.
29960	33120	And the only thing that gets me off.
33120	35440	Hello, my devilish darlings.
35440	42240	I am Lenora LeVay, your hostess of horror, your rare and radiant maiden of mayhem.
42240	46560	Tonight's program is about the death of meaning itself.
46560	48920	The story is rather simple, really.
48920	53280	The he's become she's, and the she's become he's, and those in the middle are them and
53280	54280	them.
54280	59920	And then, my dreadful dears, the western world shall surely succumb to renewable energy, affordable
59920	63480	health care, and video games for lesbians.
63480	71160	But there's one man who stands in the way, the villain of tonight's thriller, a meddling
71160	78200	little cipher of a man, a man who prefers light to darkness, reason to madness, order
78200	79200	to chaos.
79200	81600	Can you imagine?
81600	88360	His name is Ben Shapiro, and his catchphrase, facts don't care about your feelings.
88360	90600	Can our heroine put a stop to this?
90600	93400	Well, I'm just the executioner.
93400	96160	You, my vile viewers, must be the judge.
118360	129040	Hi girls, it's me, Ms. Points, Mademoiselle Poin.
129040	132200	Words, words, words, what do they even fucking mean?
132200	136760	Well, I don't know, and I don't care, but we have to talk about it anyway, because of
136760	138480	a boy named Ben Shapiro.
138480	140280	So who is Ben Shapiro?
140280	145840	Well, he's a popular conservative pundit, the editor of the Daily Wire, and the auteur
145840	150480	behind such criterion-collection classics as Ben Shapiro Destroys Yale Snowflakes, Ben
150480	155200	Shapiro Destroys Every College Snowflake Part 7, Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College
155200	159720	Snowflake, and Ben Shapiro Destroy Caitlyn Jenner.
159720	165600	Ben's especially notorious for his provocative, controversial, politically incorrect, snowflake-smashing
165600	168240	refusal to call transgender people by their pronouns.
168240	171560	I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner
171560	172560	a she.
172560	177120	It's surprising, you might think, for a person so insistent on the value of civil discussion.
177120	179120	And let's be civil, right?
179120	180280	That's the tone of the day.
180280	181280	I'm a fan.
181280	185880	But Ben seems to abandon civility in his discussions of trans people, preferring to fall back on
185880	186880	his edgier mantra,
186880	188560	Facts don't care about your feelings.
188560	192120	And you know, on this one point, I actually agree with Ben.
192120	195000	It's true, facts don't care about my feelings.
195000	199440	I dislike this trend toward regarding as a conclusive argument the proposition,
199440	201600	This makes me feel invalidated.
201600	206120	Because sometimes, things that make you feel bad, are true.
206120	211200	It makes me feel bad that I used to be a sexy, sexy boy with rippling abs, but too fucking
211200	216160	bad for me, because there I am, indelibly exhibited on YouTube for everyone to gawk
216160	217160	at forever.
217160	219400	Mm, I was a yum-yum though.
219400	220780	Build me a time machine, doc.
220780	223280	We call this auto-androphilia, nurse.
223280	224280	What can I say?
224280	225280	I like younger men.
225280	226440	I'm a cougar.
226440	227440	In tiger's clothing.
228440	230960	So look, I want to be treated like an adult.
230960	232600	I don't want to be indulged.
232600	235480	If I'm delusional, I want to be disillusioned.
235480	239360	I don't want people lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories I need to
239360	241400	tell myself to make it through the night.
241400	245200	It's probably just dry down there, they're just ingrown hairs.
245200	248240	I'm sure plenty of healthy people have blood in their urine.
248240	252520	I don't want my gender to be tolerated in the way that liberal Christians tolerate other
252520	254920	of course false and heathen religions.
254920	257320	I am an evangelical transsexual.
257320	259000	I don't want toleration, dammit.
259000	260000	I want converts.
260000	261000	Excuse me, sir.
261000	263760	Do you have a moment to talk about my woman head?
263760	264760	Sure.
264760	265760	Go ahead.
265760	266760	Touch it.
266760	267760	So look, Shapiro.
267760	268760	Benny.
268760	269760	Baby.
269760	272360	I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales.
272360	277800	To melt away every crystal of my snowflakery and henceforth dispense only the most scalding
277800	278800	tea.
278800	279800	Alright, big boy?
279800	281160	Let's have it.
281160	282920	I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner.
282920	285200	I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner a she.
285200	286200	Because you can't change her sex.
286200	287200	You can change her name.
287200	288200	Caitlyn Jenner is a man.
288200	289200	A biological man.
289200	292600	And if he were born with a high dosage of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also
292600	293600	not be a woman.
293600	294600	Right.
294600	295600	You are determined by your chromosomes.
295600	300680	So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,
300680	302800	that is, XX sex chromosomes.
302800	307640	And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would
307640	309400	be tantamount to a lie.
309400	314960	I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't let a transgender
315040	317040	like woman be called she or something.
317040	318400	Because it is a lie.
318400	322720	So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means
322720	328600	to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you must think that when we call a trans
328600	332540	woman she, we are saying that she has a normal female karyotype.
332540	337920	But hold on, I'm a transgender woman and I've never claimed to have a normal female karyotype,
337920	344200	and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am, girlfriend,
344200	348720	ladies, good girl, good girl, just like that, don't stop, don't stop.
348720	351120	Are all of us deluded about my biology?
351120	352120	No.
352120	357680	It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro, it is you who misunderstands language.
357680	362240	You have deceptively framed the debate as a debate about biology, which it is not.
362240	364080	We all agree on the biology.
364080	370360	The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words, such as he, she, man, and woman.
370360	373520	But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?
373520	378240	Well there are two kinds of arguments we could make, descriptive or prescriptive.
378240	382840	If we take the descriptive approach, then what we must do is act like anthropologists
382840	388080	and study the way a word, for instance she, is used by a linguistic community, and whatever
388080	390480	the social convention is is what's correct.
390480	394280	But if we take the prescriptive approach, then we must make an argument about the way
394280	400000	the word she should be used, meaning we either defer to an authority such as the dictionary,
400000	403760	or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy, or we must have some goal that we want to
403760	407920	accomplish by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.
407920	411920	Now if we take the descriptive approach, you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call
411920	413920	me she, and that's all there is to it.
413920	419640	What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical, you don't put an article
419640	420640	before a pronoun.
420640	422840	That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.
422840	427760	Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905, while the English pronouns he and
427760	432320	she originate in the Proto-Germanic language spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern
432320	434760	Europe beginning around 500 BCE.
434760	438960	Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person pronouns of the English language
438960	444160	refer specifically to karyotype, it is you, and not I, who is breaking from linguistic
444160	445800	tradition, Ben Shapiro.
445800	451360	However, as a trans woman, it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.
451360	454160	So let's try out a prescriptive approach.
454160	458880	Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used, how do we decide how a word
458880	461000	should be used?
461000	465960	Language is by nature ambiguous, and the way we attempt to disambiguate it is often motivated
465960	467400	by political goals.
467400	471840	Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she because his political goal is to
471840	477160	reinforce rigid conservative gender roles, whereas I think we should call trans women
477160	482240	she because my political goal is to live in a society where I can achieve the same level
482240	484600	of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
484600	488440	It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage from a decade ago.
488440	492360	Opponents argued the dictionary and legal definition of marriage was union between a
492360	499080	man and a woman, and the definition shouldn't be changed becauseâ€¦ it's the definition.
499080	501080	And how am I supposed to explain to my child?
501080	505400	And on the other hand, gay people argued that the definition should be changed, because
505400	509400	they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
509400	514400	And they succeeded, because as it turns out, you can in fact change the definitions of
514400	515400	words.
515400	519240	The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the bible, and for that matter you can
519240	520240	change the bible.
520240	522960	I mean have you read the contemporary English version?
522960	525200	The prose is atrocious, appalling.
525200	526440	I won't stand for this.
526440	530280	But unlike the debate about gay marriage, the question about trans womanhood is more
530280	532440	than just a political and legal dispute.
532440	536880	It seems to me that whatever Church, State, and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already
536880	538840	are and will continue to be women.
539000	543760	And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime
543760	545320	rival Blair White.
545320	549720	Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.
549720	554080	The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting his usual position that pronouns are used
554080	557520	to designate so-called biological men and biological women.
557520	561800	Blair responds by observing that Ben's way of using pronouns is in her case completely
561800	562800	impractical.
562800	566880	Well if you and I were to go to a business dinner, or any kind of dinner, and you were
566880	571200	meeting me at a restaurant, and I was there first, and I was in an orange shirt, and you
571200	575440	had to tell, you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair, and they said okay,
575440	579720	and you had to describe me to take me to the table, um, you wouldn't say the man in the
579720	582240	orange shirt, you would say Blair, you would say her over there.
582240	585640	Ben then responds saying, I think there's some truth to that, meaning that I think that
585640	589880	there is a utility to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same as suggesting
589880	593360	that a transgender woman is a she in the objective sense.
593360	596800	And Blair responds to that with what I think is a very good analogy.
596800	601440	For instance, if someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them
601440	604800	that kid's parents, because they're not, like they're just literally not, there's no link
604800	609520	at all biologically, but there is a social reason to do it, and there's a legal reason to do it.
609520	611160	Let's expand on that analogy.
611160	614640	Suppose you're an adoptive parent, and you're arguing with someone who says your adopted
614640	618360	child isn't really your child, and you aren't really a parent.
618360	622720	As evidence, they point to the dictionary definition of parent, one that begets or brings
622720	624120	forth offspring.
624120	629080	You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue, therefore you are not a parent.
629080	630960	Facts don't care about your feelings.
630960	635760	No matter how much you love and care for this child, you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.
635760	640360	I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument is being uncivil, yes, being
640360	644000	provocative, controversial, politically incorrect.
644000	646040	But they're not just impolite.
646040	648100	They're also wrong.
648100	653400	Because an adoptive parent is, socially and functionally, just as real a parent as a biological
653400	657840	parent, and to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.
657840	660480	So what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?
660480	663840	I would say that we actually do have different descriptions for adoptive parents than biological
663840	664840	parents, right?
664840	668120	You'll say in shorthand that they're parents, because they're all different types of parents,
668120	669880	but we do say adoptive parents.
669880	670880	Right.
670880	671880	Adoptive parents.
671880	673920	An entirely valid type of parent.
673920	676720	To call them parents is not a lie.
676720	681940	And then the question becomes, okay, exactly as the context that you were suggesting matters,
681940	683580	in what context are we talking about the parents?
683580	684820	Are we talking about a PTA meeting?
684820	689260	Okay, this person is the legal guardian, and therefore the parent, because parenting has
689260	690260	two aspects, right?
690260	693940	There's the biological parentage, and then there is the actual role of parenting.
693940	698140	So yes, there are some contexts where we do need to distinguish between biological and
698140	699140	adoptive parents.
699140	703380	For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk of some hereditary disease, they need
703380	705740	to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.
705740	710660	But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts, it doesn't matter in the slightest.
710660	714380	In the dinner conversation, the same thing sort of holds true, meaning there is the biological
714380	718260	role of woman, which you are not, and then there is the, you look like a woman, which
718260	721960	is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter when he comes to direct me to the table.
721960	726300	Just when Ben seems on the cusp of having a breakthrough, he and Blair pause their argument
726300	729860	to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.
729860	734620	From what I've seen, a lot of your interactions with trans people, they always end up kind
734620	735620	of ugly.
735620	736620	You know what I mean?
736620	737620	Yeah.
737620	738620	There was the, I think the person's name was Zoe Tur.
738620	740620	There was the threat of physical violence.
740620	742420	What are your genetics, sir?
742420	745020	You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.
745020	748860	Yeah, I mean what's hilarious about this, Blair, is literally the exact same thing that
748860	752940	I'm saying to you right now is exactly what I said to Zoe Tur on the air.
752940	755660	But that's not exactly true, is it Ben?
755660	757820	Zoe threatened you after you called her sir.
757820	760700	And you didn't call Blair sir, did you?
760700	762460	Why did you call Zoe sir?
762460	767620	What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit, oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?
767620	770300	I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.
770300	773860	I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.
773860	779420	Queen Guinevere said in days of old, I knight thee Lancelot, thou that art care-y-o-typically
779420	780420	male.
780420	784220	And you're exactly right, when people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F-you,
784220	786020	that's not a great way to change my mind.
786020	787740	It turns out that's not particularly convincing.
787740	791140	So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?
791140	796980	Did Blair budge you an inch with her rationality, her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?
796980	798900	It doesn't seem like she did.
798900	802180	At the end of this debate, you regurgitate your original position undigested.
802180	806300	You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site, and my basic rule is that when we're
806300	809420	discussing people who are trans, we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman and
809420	814260	then refer to them by their biological pronoun, because biology is the nature of the pronouns.
814260	816460	Biology is the nature of the pronouns?
816460	820500	Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you that in most contexts that's not true for her?
820500	823020	Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.
823020	827140	There are some contexts where it makes sense to distinguish between adoptive parents and
827140	828660	biological parents.
828660	833140	Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts where it makes sense to distinguish
833140	838060	between transgender and cisgender, or as you say, biological women.
838060	842020	For instance, when discussing who needs access to certain reproductive healthcare you think
842020	843180	should be illegal.
843180	845220	But does this apply to pronouns?
845220	850820	That is, are pronouns technical biological terms denoting karyotypes, or are they part
850820	853900	of the everyday language we use to describe each other socially?
853900	855820	The answer is obvious.
855820	858220	There are no geneticists studying pronouns.
858220	862700	In fact, there is not a single biology textbook with a chapter on the difference between a
862700	864700	he and a she.
864700	867220	There is no such thing as biological pronouns.
867220	872420	This is a phrase invented in the last decade to describe the misgendering of trans people.
872420	877260	So as a trans woman, I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.
877260	881980	She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me, regardless of my anatomy, which is
881980	886100	none of your business Ben Shapiro, fascinating though it is.
886100	890580	And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother that her son is not her child, to call
890580	896020	me he is not just rude or insensitive, it is, in effect, false.
896020	900940	But it is also rude and insensitive, so even if you don't agree with me, you could still
900940	901940	not.
901940	902940	What's the harm, right?
902940	907060	If I teach my almost four year old girl that she can become a boy, then I think that is
907060	910140	not only lying to her, I think it's confusing her and I think it's damaging to her psyche.
910140	912260	Oh yes, the classic argument.
912260	914500	How do I explain to my child?
914500	918100	Kill your shitty child for all I care, that's simply not my problem.
918100	920380	I regret every night I spent with you Ben Shapiro.
920380	923140	I'm in a new relationship now, with a lesbian.
923140	924620	You and I are through.
924620	927020	I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.
933340	936620	It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.
936620	941420	I won't allow my children to watch movies unless there's at least a bloodbath.
941420	943060	Or maybe an orgy.
943060	946540	But hey, I don't choose this schlock, I just present it.
946540	951580	The second program of tonight's science fiction double feature is about a cult of chaos hell
951580	954420	bent on destroying western civilization.
954420	957340	I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.
958340	964620	Hi boys, it's points again.
964620	966620	Same queen, new look, try to keep up.
966620	970860	In my previous video, Nasty T-Babe Likes It Rough, I made an argument about why it's
970860	975100	correct to call trans women she, but I'd be bullshitting you if I only discussed fully
975100	977300	integrated binary trans people.
977300	979940	Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.
979940	984540	Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort to continue the charade of misgendering
984540	985540	them.
986540	991460	I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.
991460	992460	Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.
992460	1000220	I limited my argument to trans women who look the way society expects a woman to look, because
1000220	1004420	cis people have an easier time making sense of that, but the reality is that in a lot
1004420	1006780	of cases, it's a little more complicated.
1006780	1011940	Now, as far as early transition trans people go, I am fairly integrated.
1011940	1014100	Everybody basically gets that I'm a woman.
1014100	1019220	Without me having to explain my gender, strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.
1019220	1022100	Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?
1022100	1024540	But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.
1024540	1027780	I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.
1027780	1033340	Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M, but needless to say it was a desperate emergency,
1033340	1037420	and by emergency I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's, and what happened next
1037420	1042140	stays between me and the Lord, but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched
1042140	1043140	in-
1043140	1046260	Okay, I embellished the story a little.
1046260	1047420	He wasn't cute.
1047420	1052620	So between being 6'1", the horrific transsexual squawking I try to pass off as my voice, and
1052620	1056900	my tragic inability to conduct myself in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,
1056900	1061660	your girl remains, despite my desperate, painstaking efforts, somewhat clockable.
1061660	1063420	You look great, hun.
1064220	1068180	In that debate between Ben and Blair, Blair says that pronoun usage boils down to what
1068180	1069180	you look like.
1069180	1071980	But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.
1071980	1076740	And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you largely based on your appearance.
1076740	1080500	So appearance definitely matters, but in my opinion, passing, in the sense of looking
1080500	1083740	like a cis woman, is really the most important thing.
1083740	1089060	What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off, the way you speak, the gestures,
1089060	1090820	the conversational dynamic.
1090820	1095140	That kind of stuff, to me, is what makes a person viscerally seem like a man or a woman.
1095140	1100980	So my goal isn't necessarily to serve unclockable fish, so much as to embody a certain kind
1100980	1103940	of diaphanous archetypal femininity.
1103940	1106100	In layman's terms, girl dick energy.
1106100	1109300	Also I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank god.
1109300	1113300	Last month I released a video called Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe, and a lot
1113300	1117300	of trans people got mad at me because they thought I was saying that performing your
1117300	1120900	gender is the only thing that matters, and that how you identify counts for nothing.
1120900	1122580	But that's not what I think.
1122580	1127500	I do prefer to argue that trans women are women because we live the lives of women,
1127500	1131580	because I think that's a much more compelling argument than I'm a woman because I psychologically
1131580	1135700	identify as a woman, which in my experience doesn't really persuade anyone.
1135700	1137380	It's just too easy to poke holes in it.
1137380	1141620	But identity definitely does matter, especially when it comes to pronouns, and I'll explain why.
1141620	1147260	Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people are very sensitive about anyone
1147260	1151940	telling them what pronouns to use, so I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings
1151940	1155680	and what a difficult and personal issue this must be for you.
1155680	1159980	After all, we live in a repressive political era, despite the best efforts of hero professor
1159980	1160980	Jordan B. Peterson.
1160980	1166660	But alas, he was too late, now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech and sends people
1166660	1170620	to jail for- oh it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?
1170620	1174540	Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail for pronoun misuse.
1175540	1186540	ðŸŽµsad musicðŸŽµ
1186540	1191340	Oh, guess that, uh, guess that was a false alarm, huh?
1191340	1193020	God, goddammit.
1193020	1197060	Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use, I'm just gonna tell you how
1197060	1201700	I use pronouns and my reasoning behind it, and you are welcome to use your free speech
1201700	1206100	to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be, okay?
1206100	1207900	So, back to identity.
1207900	1213980	If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets, and a customer were to walk in looking
1213980	1220020	like this, I might ordinarily default to female pronouns, but that would be wrong, since I
1220020	1226260	happen to know this person is not only a man, he is THE man, YouTube's most regal makeup
1226260	1231260	artist, his lordship John McClane, and he uses he-him pronouns.
1231260	1235860	Likewise, if I were approached by this person, I'd fall in love and then default to female
1235860	1241380	pronouns, and this time I'd be correct, but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,
1241380	1245700	but because she's gender-fluid drag queen Courtney Act, who has the fucking audacity
1245700	1250020	to be a more beautiful woman than I am, and who so far as I know uses male pronouns in
1250020	1253820	boy mode and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.
1253820	1258260	A lot of the complexities of gender, language, identity, and expression get played out in
1258260	1259540	the world of drag.
1259540	1264780	Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men, who live as men and perform as women.
1264780	1270060	Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon, Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke,
1270060	1271540	identify as non-binary.
1271540	1276100	Others still are bio-queens, cis women who perform as drag queens, like Lucy Garland
1276100	1277100	or Creme Fatale.
1277100	1281780	And then there are trans women who are also drag queens, like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or
1281780	1282780	for that matter, me.
1282780	1287740	I mean look at me, do you think I dress like this when I go to 7-Eleven at 2am?
1287740	1288740	Because I do.
1288740	1289740	Look what I've become.
1289740	1292180	A bisexual, transsexual drag queen.
1292180	1296620	Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake, I just through pure coincidence
1296620	1300620	happened to be the most interesting and unique person who ever lived, I'm so sorry, I can't
1300620	1301620	help it.
1301620	1302620	So let's recap.
1302620	1306540	There are gender non-conforming men who present very femme but use male pronouns.
1306540	1310180	There are cis men who use female pronouns whenever they present female.
1310180	1314420	There are genderfluid people who use different pronouns depending on their current presentation.
1314420	1318180	There are pre-transition trans people who identify as a gender other than the one they
1318180	1321060	present and live as and prefer other pronouns.
1321060	1324460	So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks, because there's a lot of
1324460	1327900	situations where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.
1327900	1333500	So as you can see, identity definitely is important, but it's also not the only thing
1333500	1334500	that matters.
1334500	1338500	If psychological identity were the only thing that mattered, then there would be no need
1338500	1343180	for a trans person to come out or do anything to transition, including requesting different
1343180	1348260	pronouns, because pronouns belong to the social world of language, not to individual
1348260	1349260	psychology.
1349260	1352860	This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.
1352860	1358260	You can identify however you like, but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.
1358260	1363420	So if, for example, you're a trans woman still living as a man, then you are fully
1363420	1368300	trans, your identity is fully valid, but until you begin living as a woman, your womanhood
1368300	1370300	remains kind of hypothetical.
1370420	1373660	And when I say living as a woman, I don't mean passing.
1373660	1378740	There's too much emphasis on physical appearance, and not enough on social relationships.
1378740	1381500	You know, you don't become a woman the first time you put on a dress.
1381500	1385340	You become a woman the first time an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant
1385340	1386340	and says,
1386340	1387880	Maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.
1387880	1390340	My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.
1390340	1394180	As far as I'm concerned, if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet, they are fully
1394180	1395180	trans.
1395180	1399180	I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact that a lot of people's gendered experience
1399500	1401660	isn't entirely a product of how they identify.
1401660	1406060	Put it this way, I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman, but my thought
1406060	1408820	process behind it isn't always the same.
1408820	1413780	Many trans women just seem like women to me, in literally the same way that cis women seem
1413780	1417780	like women, and I use female pronouns for them effortlessly just as I was trained to
1417780	1418780	do from birth.
1418780	1421980	This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.
1421980	1426700	We want not necessarily to pass perfectly, but at least to seem like our genders to the
1426700	1427980	people around us.
1427980	1432180	As Laura Jane Grace put it, you want them to see you like they see every other girl.
1432180	1436380	I want people calling me she not out of politeness or respect for my identity
1436380	1437780	AS A TRANS WOMAN
1437780	1440420	but just because I seem like a woman to them.
1440420	1446700	Because the reality is, not all trans women seem like a woman to me in that visceral way,
1446700	1451380	and I live with this constant crushing anxiety that I don't seem like a woman to other people.
1451380	1455580	I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen, and I cope with that fear by looking
1455580	1457460	like a second-rate drag queen.
1457460	1462460	But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears a 0% woman, if she tells me she's
1462460	1466660	a trans woman, I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.
1466660	1471700	Not just to be polite, but also because I want to recognize the reality of her psychological
1471700	1476700	experience, and especially because I want to help her re-socialize and reintegrate into
1476700	1478540	the world as her true gender.
1478540	1483820	And of course, cis people, you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that, but if you
1483820	1486740	refuse, you are being a shit gibbon.
1486740	1489340	And I would prefer that you not be a shit gibbon.
1489340	1492540	Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.
1492540	1497380	An increasing number of people identify not as male or female, but as non-binary, an umbrella
1497380	1502500	term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,
1502500	1504220	greygender, and so on.
1504220	1506580	Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.
1506580	1508420	In English, usually they.
1508420	1512420	Now if your first impulse is to argue that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense, consider
1512420	1517140	that having gendered singular third-person pronouns at all is a particular feature of
1517140	1521700	the English language that's by no means shared by all other languages, including Turkish,
1521700	1524420	Korean, and Finnish, which don't have them at all.
1524420	1527220	Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds coming out of your mouth that humans make
1527220	1528740	up to suit our purposes.
1528740	1532420	If you're new to using singular they, it is a little confusing at first, but with some
1532420	1534260	practice it gets pretty easy.
1534260	1538940	They poured milk on me, I poured milk on them, they did anoint themselves in their milk and
1538940	1540900	it was good, thus saith the Lord.
1540900	1542820	So the polite thing to do here is easy.
1542820	1546260	If someone asks you to call them they, you call them they.
1546260	1550500	But if you're like me, you don't want to just do a thing because you dogmatically believe
1550500	1552020	it's the woke thing to do.
1552020	1554340	You want to understand why you're doing it.
1554340	1558660	I don't just want to tolerate non-binary people, I want to be a convert.
1558660	1562780	I want to believe about them what they believe about themselves, so long as those beliefs
1562780	1563780	are reasonable.
1563780	1565620	So what do all these words mean?
1565620	1567380	What are these people talking about?
1567380	1570700	Remember earlier we distinguished gender expression from gender identity.
1570700	1575700	John McClane is feminine in expression but a man in identity, whereas I am a woman in
1575700	1578740	identity and in expression I am a mess.
1578740	1584060	Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's great contributions to humanity, art, science,
1584060	1587580	spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futch scale.
1587580	1592220	The Futch scale is a diagram that looks like this and quantifies from 1 to 10, or high
1592220	1597140	femme to stone butch, the gender expression of a given domain, such as Mulan looks or
1597140	1598460	Steven Universe characters.
1598860	1604140	It can also be used more abstractly for weapons, fish Pokemon, or wind instruments.
1604140	1608580	Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do with words like genderqueer, agender, greygender,
1608580	1613780	and so on is to give to identity the same kind of specificity the Futch scale gives
1613780	1614780	to expression.
1614780	1618460	But my input on this isn't really worth that much, because I'm not non-binary.
1618460	1622900	And to tell you the truth, I kind of feel for cis people here because all this talk
1622900	1627460	about gender identity, a lot of the time I don't really get it either.
1627460	1631460	I look inside myself and ask, do I feel like a man or a woman?
1631460	1635820	And after all these years, the answer is still that I feel like shit.
1635820	1637620	And that's how I experience gender.
1637620	1642540	I live, I exist, as a woman, which is the only way I can achieve the same level of sadness
1642540	1644580	and dysfunction as everyone else.
1644580	1646780	And I identify as trash.
1646780	1651100	I guess there are certain moments that make me feel like a natural woman, oh, listening
1651100	1656260	to Aretha Franklin, the pain and ecstasy of penetration, waiting in a long-ass line for
1656260	1661140	the restroom, a big strong arm around my waist, being asked if I have any tampons,
1661140	1666460	having tampons in case someone asks, a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me, and me going
1666460	1669100	oh really, wow.
1669100	1672920	But you know these experiences mean different things to different people, so all I can really
1672920	1678700	tell you is that I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures, that taking
1678700	1682740	female hormones and having feminizing medical procedures makes me feel more at home in my
1682740	1687700	body, and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman, socially, spiritually,
1687700	1688700	sexually.
1688700	1691500	So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender as I see it.
1691500	1696420	Am I really truly a woman ontologically, neurologically, metaphysically?
1696420	1699420	Well honestly, I don't even know what that would mean.
1699420	1705220	But I do know that the life I live as a woman is the only life I have, and that, I think,
1705220	1706580	is legitimate enough.
1706580	1710940	So I know what living as a woman means to me, but what does it mean to live a non-binary
1710940	1711940	life?
1712140	1715140	Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman, that's something that's going
1715140	1717780	to vary between individuals and cultures.
1717780	1722300	Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions, such as the Hidra of South Asia, a legally
1722300	1727380	recognized gender in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, or the various two-spirit
1727380	1730620	traditions of indigenous North American tribes.
1730620	1734740	Non-indigenous American culture doesn't have a third gender tradition, but we do have individual
1734740	1739340	non-binary people, some of whom are making content that has taught me a lot about non-binary
1739340	1742780	experience, non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.
1742780	1746260	We have a lot in common, binary and non-binary trans people.
1746260	1751260	Even as a binary trans person, I used to live as one gender and now I live as another gender.
1751260	1755460	That in itself is a pretty serious challenge to the stability of the binary.
1755460	1759180	But many of the people who call themselves non-binary seem to be fighting for something
1759180	1762780	more radical than what I'm fighting for, at least in my personal life.
1762780	1768060	I'm just trying to assimilate into a pre-existing female gender role.
1768100	1770420	As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed.
1770420	1772740	The traditional female carp of my culture.
1772740	1775420	Nier nier nier nier nier nier nier.
1775420	1776780	No!
1776780	1781260	Whereas non-binary people are trying to cast off these roles entirely, they're effectively
1781260	1784480	trying to create the society that includes them.
1784480	1789140	And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes with some non-binary people who, for example,
1789140	1792220	promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.
1792220	1797060	Whereas I love it when people assume my gender, provided they assume it correctly.
1797140	1800700	Otherwise I will throw you in imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.
1800700	1805620	But what we all agree on is that many trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people
1805620	1810140	find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns other than the ones that Ben Shapiro
1810140	1811260	wants you to use.
1811260	1814140	So if you want me to call you they, I'm gonna call you they.
1814140	1820020	And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer, to do or say anything, I do hope you
1820020	1825380	use your free will to freely choose to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.
1825380	1826380	Freely.
1827060	1828060	Freely.
1828060	1829060	Freely.
1829060	1830060	Freely.
1830060	1831060	Freely.
1831060	1832060	Freely.
1832060	1833060	Freely.
1833060	1834060	Freely.
1834060	1836580	Well, at least there was a hideous monster this time.
1836580	1840540	I'm talking about the female lead.
1840540	1842280	Now the fun really begins.
1842280	1843280	The show's over.
1843280	1846300	I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.
1846300	1848860	So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.
1848860	1854200	Until next week, go to hell!
1854400	1865400	You can't make me you.
1865400	1873400	You can't make that true.
1873400	1882400	This is who I am.
1882400	1893600	We'll go hand in hand in hand in hand.
1912400	1915600	We'll go hand in hand in hand.
