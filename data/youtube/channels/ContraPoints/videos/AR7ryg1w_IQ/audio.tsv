0	27520	I like stuff. I like this, and I like this, and I like this.
27520	29760	I like stuff, and I want more stuff.
31200	36160	My child, hearken to my voice. It is I, Socrates.
36160	38080	Oh no. What do you want?
38080	40480	I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.
41040	44880	Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.
44880	49280	My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.
49280	52960	Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness,
52960	55840	the rational contemplation of truth and justice?
56560	60560	Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.
60560	63280	I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.
63280	66880	Ach, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.
66880	71200	Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself,
71200	75440	perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.
76000	79600	Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that into consideration.
80400	81920	Ugh, Greeks.
81920	87680	Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.
87680	91280	But happiness, what does that word even mean?
91280	93680	I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things,
93680	96640	and these are questions really better left to the philosophers,
96640	99920	which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video.
99920	103120	Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works
103120	105840	of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced,
105840	108960	a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply
108960	111280	the concept of the fetishism of the commodity.
111280	115360	I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed Video
115360	118480	about three men who are younger than me who travel the world
118480	121520	and try different foods that cost different amounts of money,
121520	124640	and then say whether it was worth it.
124640	128080	In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants
128080	130160	at three drastically different price points
130160	132960	to find out which one is the most worth it.
132960	138720	For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold,
138720	143600	and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,
143600	147840	and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.
147840	148960	It is a lot of gold.
148960	150640	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
150640	151760	A gonjapreneur!
151760	156480	Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder,
156480	158720	but we intellectuals, well,
158720	161520	we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.
161520	163760	We like to take it all in.
163760	164480	Ah!
164480	167440	The Worth It Boys, Andrew, Adam, Stephen,
168240	170400	these are not mere content creators,
170400	174320	mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.
174320	177600	They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even,
177600	180720	and what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly,
180720	184800	far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin,
184800	188480	Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Luk√°cs,
188480	192080	Zarathustra, and even our dear bread mom Kropotkin.
192080	195600	I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many,
195600	198400	many times, but I always come away dissatisfied,
198400	200720	and I find myself returning, yet again,
200720	204320	to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.
204320	208960	See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.
208960	210640	Is it worth it?
210640	211760	We may never know.
211760	216880	Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.
216880	218720	Which is the better deal?
218720	222400	I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?
222400	224000	Well, according to Karl Marx,
224000	227360	the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.
227360	229680	On the one hand, there's the use value,
229680	233040	the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.
233040	236000	And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,
236000	239920	the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable
239920	241680	with every other commodity,
241680	246400	deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.
246400	248320	But let's not oversimplify things.
248320	251520	Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us,
251520	253360	the viewers of Worth It,
253360	257200	to understand the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy
257200	259840	not as a mere hierarchical binary,
259840	262720	but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome,
262720	267040	a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections
267040	269280	as the truffles on the pizza itself.
269280	270880	Am I making myself clear?
270880	271440	I'm not.
271440	275120	It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon
275120	277520	and not actually helping me think through this any better.
277520	282640	So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.
282640	283280	Fuck this!
292080	295200	I like stuff, and I like shiny things.
295200	297200	Now that's something everyone can understand,
297200	300640	so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory
300640	302320	I'll be developing in this video.
302320	306000	So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,
306000	307440	let's return to the question.
307440	310080	Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?
310080	315040	Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that.
315040	318400	But the pizza itself seems kind of gross.
318400	321280	It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,
321280	325360	stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.
325360	328880	These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.
328880	332240	The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.
332240	335520	It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.
335520	340080	But Andrew and Steven sit there, with New York's financial district for a backdrop,
340080	343600	and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.
347200	348800	I'm honestly speechless.
348800	349680	I feel weird.
349680	350480	Is it the gold?
350480	352800	I just ate $250.
352800	354960	I feel kind of like I'm committing a crime.
354960	358640	And that's what $1,250 looks like.
359280	364560	There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza
364560	369280	isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.
369280	373120	It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money
373120	377680	on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.
377680	379520	Is there a name for that feeling?
379520	383040	Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.
383040	386320	In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,
386320	390560	a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.
390560	393920	You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,
393920	398000	but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.
398000	401840	To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,
401840	404880	you have to understand it in the context of capitalism.
404880	409360	The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,
409360	413280	and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,
413280	416720	because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.
416720	422400	For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.
422400	425680	And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening
425680	428480	worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.
428480	432400	And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza
432400	437440	seem not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene or even immoral.
437440	441680	But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.
441680	444320	So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go
444320	448080	PIZZAS IN AFRICA COULD HAVE EATEN THOSE CHILDREN HOW DARE YOU
448080	451520	Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Stephen are bad people
451520	454960	for buying inexpensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.
454960	459120	The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable
459120	462640	these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.
462640	465760	That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher Peter Singer,
465760	469200	who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved
469200	473200	if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers
473200	476640	and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.
476640	479600	I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,
479600	482480	but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy
482480	487920	is structured around cheap exploited labor at the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.
487920	490560	Another way to approach this issue might be to ask,
490560	492880	who are the goddamn reptiles?
492880	494880	Well they're certainly not the Jews.
494880	497440	I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page,
497440	499920	that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.
500800	503440	Except, you know, cucking the white race.
503440	505760	But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.
505760	507920	The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.
507920	509680	So the lizards are not the Jews.
509680	512000	They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.
512000	515120	They're not Freemasons or globalists or the Gay Agenda.
515120	519040	But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.
519040	522160	The lizards are capital itself.
522160	523520	And what does that mean?
523520	527360	Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?
527360	529760	What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy
529760	534080	are not just the product of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.
534080	538640	Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.
538640	542880	And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.
542880	546480	So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact
546480	551600	that the extreme economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.
551600	554880	If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument,
554880	556560	it would go something like this.
556560	560400	Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because,
560400	562720	although it's good at creating large amounts of wealth,
562720	565840	it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way,
565840	570160	where efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth,
570160	572960	but as the capacity to maximize human happiness.
572960	575120	Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.
575120	576000	Here's a question.
576000	579760	Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?
579760	583280	It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity,
583280	585680	so what I look for in a good economic system
585680	589040	is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of it.
589040	590720	So if you're willing to go along with this,
590720	592560	the first question we should ask is,
592560	595040	does having more wealth make people happier?
595040	596960	And we actually have data about that,
596960	599520	at least within the context of our own economic system,
599520	604240	and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point.
604240	607200	But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus
607200	610720	somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000 a year.
610720	614800	One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold
614800	616560	is that at lower income levels,
616560	622480	more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical bills or college tuition.
622480	624240	But once you pass the threshold,
624240	628480	more income basically just translates into more disappointing golden pizzas.
628480	630400	If that interpretation is correct,
630400	633920	then the current income distribution seems really irrational,
633920	636320	at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.
636320	640560	The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme,
640560	645920	so that the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone,
645920	651040	but the national median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.
651040	657120	Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year,
657120	659760	several times the peak happiness threshold.
659760	661600	So at least to my naive eyes,
661600	664960	what it looks like is that millions of people in this country
664960	670240	don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,
670240	672320	while a few million others are like,
672320	675440	constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.
675440	677760	But I'm guessing it's even worse than that,
677760	681760	because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,
681760	685680	it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.
685680	688080	And since people compare themselves to others,
688080	692720	that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties and resentments and social tensions.
692720	696480	There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey
696480	698400	for a task with a delicious grape,
698400	701440	and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,
701440	704080	the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.
704080	708240	And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.
708240	710000	But that's just how it looks to me.
710000	710880	I could be wrong.
710880	713040	I mean, I'm not an economic theorist,
713040	717040	and honestly, I don't really understand how the economy works.
717040	719920	I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.
719920	722640	I make the videos, I swipe the card.
722640	726080	So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually,
726080	729120	just leave a comment and I'll be happy to be proven wrong.
729120	733200	But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.
733280	737280	Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.
737280	741280	Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.
741280	746000	Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.
746000	749200	And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs
749200	751360	just to sustain themselves and their families.
751360	754960	It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.
754960	757600	But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.
757600	760640	Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher
760640	762720	if they could make a good living as a janitor?
762720	766400	Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.
766400	768000	Someone has to cook and clean,
768000	771600	and I think people who do such necessary work deserve a decent living.
771600	774960	But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring,
774960	778560	and I think that the kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent
778560	781360	often isn't driven mainly by profit anyway.
781360	784160	Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine,
784160	786400	even though he could have made millions of dollars from it,
786400	788560	because he just cared about humanity,
788560	791520	and he was driven by a purpose beyond personal profit.
791520	795200	In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people
795200	797600	who didn't need to work for a living at all,
797600	800720	and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.
800720	802240	So let me get this straight.
802240	807040	You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.
807040	808160	Hypocrite much?
808160	811440	A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student,
811440	814800	and when I criticized capitalism then, people used to say,
814800	818000	Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?
818000	822560	You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.
822560	827280	So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,
827280	831680	and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,
831680	836400	then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?
836400	840800	Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.
840800	844240	You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?
844240	845520	Well, no, I wouldn't.
846480	851280	Hello, I'm Tatyana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.
851280	851920	Fuck off!
852720	854320	Do svidaniya, fascist.
856000	859520	So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty,
859520	863360	but that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.
863360	868160	My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,
868160	873600	but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.
873600	876640	Okay, but I like stuff.
876640	878160	I like stuff too.
878160	882160	I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes,
882160	883600	so does everything we love.
883600	889280	I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,
889280	894400	undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,
894400	897840	just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.
897840	900960	And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,
900960	904480	since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.
904480	908640	But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,
908640	912560	these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.
912560	915840	And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,
915840	916880	straight guys will be like,
916880	920000	WILL THERE BE VIDEO GAMES AFTER CAPITALISM OH GOD
920000	921360	And yeah, there will be.
921360	924640	Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

929120	931760	Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved
931760	934080	if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.
934080	937920	I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.
937920	940640	The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read,
940640	942720	Ways of Seeing by John Berger,
942720	946480	I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.
946480	949680	Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.
949680	952800	Happiness as judged from the outside by others.
952800	956160	The happiness of being envied is glamour.
956160	960160	And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.
960160	961920	And by us, I mean the gays.
961920	967440	The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.
967440	970400	But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,
970400	974320	the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy
974320	976800	in the beholder in the service of selling you shit?
976800	980480	But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,
980480	981920	not something essential to it.
981920	984240	And maybe glamour would actually be liberated
984240	986640	if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.
986640	989840	So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,
989840	991520	actually, stuff is good.
991520	992560	Glamour is good.
992560	993760	Video games are good.
993760	994800	Luxury is good.
994800	995760	Baths are good.
995760	999520	I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.
999520	1002080	You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza
1002080	1005600	is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.
1005600	1010080	The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could've paid,
1010080	1012960	but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.
1012960	1017760	So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.
1017760	1020720	But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.
1020720	1023760	I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.
1023760	1026640	Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,
1026640	1028320	I'm finally ready to get started.
1028320	1030800	Part 1, which you've all been waiting for.
1030800	1033280	How to end capitalism once and for all.
1033280	1034880	Well, I don't know.
1034880	1036320	Who do you people think I am?
1036320	1040480	I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.
1040480	1044320	I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.
1044320	1048800	Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.
1048800	1052240	So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.
1054240	1056080	I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.
1062160	1064160	You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.
1064160	1071200	Uh, so, I don't know, I guess vote labor, tweet radically, try to eat more vegetables,
1072480	1077360	try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people,
1077360	1083120	and can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?
1084560	1086240	No. No voting.
1087040	1088080	Smashing.
1088080	1091600	Well, you know what, since she's the one with the plan apparently,
1091600	1093680	I guess just do whatever she says.
1094160	1098080	‚ô™ Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl ‚ô™
1098080	1100160	Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?
1101280	1101780	Meow!
1104080	1105120	Good kitty.
1105120	1106480	Don't close the door!
1106480	1107360	Dear Comrades,
1107360	1110800	The Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,
1110800	1114400	and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.
1114400	1117920	The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video
1117920	1120480	with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabbyism.
1120840	1122840	Meow-meow-meow.
1129640	1130140	Meow.
1150480	1151480	Meow-meow-meow.
1180480	1182040	Meow-meow-meow.
