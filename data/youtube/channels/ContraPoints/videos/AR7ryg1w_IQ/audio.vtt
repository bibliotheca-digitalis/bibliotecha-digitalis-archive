00:00.000 --> 00:27.520
I like stuff. I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.760
I like stuff, and I want more stuff.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.160
My child, hearken to my voice. It is I, Socrates.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.080
Oh no. What do you want?

00:38.080 --> 00:40.480
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.880
Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.280
My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.960
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness,

00:52.960 --> 00:55.840
the rational contemplation of truth and justice?

00:56.560 --> 01:00.560
Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.280
I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.880
Ach, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.200
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself,

01:11.200 --> 01:15.440
perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.600
Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that into consideration.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.920
Ugh, Greeks.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.680
Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.280
But happiness, what does that word even mean?

01:31.280 --> 01:33.680
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things,

01:33.680 --> 01:36.640
and these are questions really better left to the philosophers,

01:36.640 --> 01:39.920
which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.120
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works

01:43.120 --> 01:45.840
of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced,

01:45.840 --> 01:48.960
a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply

01:48.960 --> 01:51.280
the concept of the fetishism of the commodity.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.360
I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed Video

01:55.360 --> 01:58.480
about three men who are younger than me who travel the world

01:58.480 --> 02:01.520
and try different foods that cost different amounts of money,

02:01.520 --> 02:04.640
and then say whether it was worth it.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.080
In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants

02:08.080 --> 02:10.160
at three drastically different price points

02:10.160 --> 02:12.960
to find out which one is the most worth it.

02:12.960 --> 02:18.720
For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold,

02:18.720 --> 02:23.600
and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,

02:23.600 --> 02:27.840
and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.960
It is a lot of gold.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.640
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

02:30.640 --> 02:31.760
A gonjapreneur!

02:31.760 --> 02:36.480
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder,

02:36.480 --> 02:38.720
but we intellectuals, well,

02:38.720 --> 02:41.520
we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.760
We like to take it all in.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.480
Ah!

02:44.480 --> 02:47.440
The Worth It Boys, Andrew, Adam, Stephen,

02:48.240 --> 02:50.400
these are not mere content creators,

02:50.400 --> 02:54.320
mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.600
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even,

02:57.600 --> 03:00.720
and what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly,

03:00.720 --> 03:04.800
far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin,

03:04.800 --> 03:08.480
Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukács,

03:08.480 --> 03:12.080
Zarathustra, and even our dear bread mom Kropotkin.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.600
I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many,

03:15.600 --> 03:18.400
many times, but I always come away dissatisfied,

03:18.400 --> 03:20.720
and I find myself returning, yet again,

03:20.720 --> 03:24.320
to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.960
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.640
Is it worth it?

03:30.640 --> 03:31.760
We may never know.

03:31.760 --> 03:36.880
Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.720
Which is the better deal?

03:38.720 --> 03:42.400
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.000
Well, according to Karl Marx,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.360
the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.680
On the one hand, there's the use value,

03:49.680 --> 03:53.040
the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.000
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.920
the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable

03:59.920 --> 04:01.680
with every other commodity,

04:01.680 --> 04:06.400
deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.320
But let's not oversimplify things.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.520
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us,

04:11.520 --> 04:13.360
the viewers of Worth It,

04:13.360 --> 04:17.200
to understand the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy

04:17.200 --> 04:19.840
not as a mere hierarchical binary,

04:19.840 --> 04:22.720
but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome,

04:22.720 --> 04:27.040
a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections

04:27.040 --> 04:29.280
as the truffles on the pizza itself.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.880
Am I making myself clear?

04:30.880 --> 04:31.440
I'm not.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.120
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon

04:35.120 --> 04:37.520
and not actually helping me think through this any better.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.640
So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.280
Fuck this!

04:52.080 --> 04:55.200
I like stuff, and I like shiny things.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.200
Now that's something everyone can understand,

04:57.200 --> 05:00.640
so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory

05:00.640 --> 05:02.320
I'll be developing in this video.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.000
So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.440
let's return to the question.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.080
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

05:10.080 --> 05:15.040
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.400
But the pizza itself seems kind of gross.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.280
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,

05:21.280 --> 05:25.360
stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.880
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.240
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.520
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.080
But Andrew and Steven sit there, with New York's financial district for a backdrop,

05:40.080 --> 05:43.600
and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.800
I'm honestly speechless.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.680
I feel weird.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.480
Is it the gold?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.800
I just ate $250.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.960
I feel kind of like I'm committing a crime.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.640
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.560
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza

06:04.560 --> 06:09.280
isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.120
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money

06:13.120 --> 06:17.680
on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.520
Is there a name for that feeling?

06:19.520 --> 06:23.040
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.320
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,

06:26.320 --> 06:30.560
a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.920
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,

06:33.920 --> 06:38.000
but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.840
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,

06:41.840 --> 06:44.880
you have to understand it in the context of capitalism.

06:44.880 --> 06:49.360
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,

06:49.360 --> 06:53.280
and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,

06:53.280 --> 06:56.720
because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.400
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.680
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening

07:05.680 --> 07:08.480
worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.400
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza

07:12.400 --> 07:17.440
seem not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene or even immoral.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.680
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.320
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go

07:24.320 --> 07:28.080
PIZZAS IN AFRICA COULD HAVE EATEN THOSE CHILDREN HOW DARE YOU

07:28.080 --> 07:31.520
Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Stephen are bad people

07:31.520 --> 07:34.960
for buying inexpensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.120
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable

07:39.120 --> 07:42.640
these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.760
That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher Peter Singer,

07:45.760 --> 07:49.200
who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved

07:49.200 --> 07:53.200
if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers

07:53.200 --> 07:56.640
and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.600
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,

07:59.600 --> 08:02.480
but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy

08:02.480 --> 08:07.920
is structured around cheap exploited labor at the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.560
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask,

08:10.560 --> 08:12.880
who are the goddamn reptiles?

08:12.880 --> 08:14.880
Well they're certainly not the Jews.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.440
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page,

08:17.440 --> 08:19.920
that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.440
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.760
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.920
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.680
So the lizards are not the Jews.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.000
They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.120
They're not Freemasons or globalists or the Gay Agenda.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.040
But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.160
The lizards are capital itself.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.520
And what does that mean?

08:43.520 --> 08:47.360
Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.760
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy

08:49.760 --> 08:54.080
are not just the product of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.640
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.880
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.480
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact

09:06.480 --> 09:11.600
that the extreme economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.880
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument,

09:14.880 --> 09:16.560
it would go something like this.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.400
Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because,

09:20.400 --> 09:22.720
although it's good at creating large amounts of wealth,

09:22.720 --> 09:25.840
it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way,

09:25.840 --> 09:30.160
where efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth,

09:30.160 --> 09:32.960
but as the capacity to maximize human happiness.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.120
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.000
Here's a question.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.760
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

09:39.760 --> 09:43.280
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity,

09:43.280 --> 09:45.680
so what I look for in a good economic system

09:45.680 --> 09:49.040
is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of it.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.720
So if you're willing to go along with this,

09:50.720 --> 09:52.560
the first question we should ask is,

09:52.560 --> 09:55.040
does having more wealth make people happier?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.960
And we actually have data about that,

09:56.960 --> 09:59.520
at least within the context of our own economic system,

09:59.520 --> 10:04.240
and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.200
But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus

10:07.200 --> 10:10.720
somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000 a year.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.800
One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold

10:14.800 --> 10:16.560
is that at lower income levels,

10:16.560 --> 10:22.480
more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical bills or college tuition.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.240
But once you pass the threshold,

10:24.240 --> 10:28.480
more income basically just translates into more disappointing golden pizzas.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.400
If that interpretation is correct,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.920
then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.320
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.560
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme,

10:40.560 --> 10:45.920
so that the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone,

10:45.920 --> 10:51.040
but the national median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

10:51.040 --> 10:57.120
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.760
several times the peak happiness threshold.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.600
So at least to my naive eyes,

11:01.600 --> 11:04.960
what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

11:04.960 --> 11:10.240
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,

11:10.240 --> 11:12.320
while a few million others are like,

11:12.320 --> 11:15.440
constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.760
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that,

11:17.760 --> 11:21.760
because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,

11:21.760 --> 11:25.680
it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.080
And since people compare themselves to others,

11:28.080 --> 11:32.720
that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties and resentments and social tensions.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.480
There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey

11:36.480 --> 11:38.400
for a task with a delicious grape,

11:38.400 --> 11:41.440
and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,

11:41.440 --> 11:44.080
the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.240
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.000
But that's just how it looks to me.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.880
I could be wrong.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.040
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist,

11:53.040 --> 11:57.040
and honestly, I don't really understand how the economy works.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.920
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.640
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

12:02.640 --> 12:06.080
So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually,

12:06.080 --> 12:09.120
just leave a comment and I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

12:09.120 --> 12:13.200
But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

12:13.280 --> 12:17.280
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

12:17.280 --> 12:21.280
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

12:21.280 --> 12:26.000
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.200
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs

12:29.200 --> 12:31.360
just to sustain themselves and their families.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.960
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.600
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.640
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher

12:40.640 --> 12:42.720
if they could make a good living as a janitor?

12:42.720 --> 12:46.400
Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.000
Someone has to cook and clean,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.600
and I think people who do such necessary work deserve a decent living.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.960
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring,

12:54.960 --> 12:58.560
and I think that the kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent

12:58.560 --> 13:01.360
often isn't driven mainly by profit anyway.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.160
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine,

13:04.160 --> 13:06.400
even though he could have made millions of dollars from it,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.560
because he just cared about humanity,

13:08.560 --> 13:11.520
and he was driven by a purpose beyond personal profit.

13:11.520 --> 13:15.200
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people

13:15.200 --> 13:17.600
who didn't need to work for a living at all,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.720
and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.240
So let me get this straight.

13:22.240 --> 13:27.040
You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.160
Hypocrite much?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.440
A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student,

13:31.440 --> 13:34.800
and when I criticized capitalism then, people used to say,

13:34.800 --> 13:38.000
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.560
You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.280
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,

13:47.280 --> 13:51.680
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,

13:51.680 --> 13:56.400
then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?

13:56.400 --> 14:00.800
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.240
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.520
Well, no, I wouldn't.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.280
Hello, I'm Tatyana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.

14:11.280 --> 14:11.920
Fuck off!

14:12.720 --> 14:14.320
Do svidaniya, fascist.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.520
So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty,

14:19.520 --> 14:23.360
but that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.

14:23.360 --> 14:28.160
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

14:28.160 --> 14:33.600
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.640
Okay, but I like stuff.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.160
I like stuff too.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.160
I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes,

14:42.160 --> 14:43.600
so does everything we love.

14:43.600 --> 14:49.280
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,

14:49.280 --> 14:54.400
undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

14:54.400 --> 14:57.840
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.960
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

15:00.960 --> 15:04.480
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.640
But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,

15:08.640 --> 15:12.560
these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.840
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,

15:15.840 --> 15:16.880
straight guys will be like,

15:16.880 --> 15:20.000
WILL THERE BE VIDEO GAMES AFTER CAPITALISM OH GOD

15:20.000 --> 15:21.360
And yeah, there will be.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.640
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

15:24.800 --> 15:29.120
🎵Soviet anthem🎵

15:29.120 --> 15:31.760
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved

15:31.760 --> 15:34.080
if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.920
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.640
The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.720
Ways of Seeing by John Berger,

15:42.720 --> 15:46.480
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.680
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.800
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.160
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.160
And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.920
And by us, I mean the gays.

16:01.920 --> 16:07.440
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.400
But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,

16:10.400 --> 16:14.320
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy

16:14.320 --> 16:16.800
in the beholder in the service of selling you shit?

16:16.800 --> 16:20.480
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,

16:20.480 --> 16:21.920
not something essential to it.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.240
And maybe glamour would actually be liberated

16:24.240 --> 16:26.640
if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.840
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,

16:29.840 --> 16:31.520
actually, stuff is good.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.560
Glamour is good.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.760
Video games are good.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.800
Luxury is good.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.760
Baths are good.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.520
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.080
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza

16:42.080 --> 16:45.600
is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.080
The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could've paid,

16:50.080 --> 16:52.960
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.760
So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.720
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.760
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.640
Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,

17:06.640 --> 17:08.320
I'm finally ready to get started.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.800
Part 1, which you've all been waiting for.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.280
How to end capitalism once and for all.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.880
Well, I don't know.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.320
Who do you people think I am?

17:16.320 --> 17:20.480
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.

17:20.480 --> 17:24.320
I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.800
Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.240
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.080
I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

17:44.160 --> 17:51.200
Uh, so, I don't know, I guess vote labor, tweet radically, try to eat more vegetables,

17:52.480 --> 17:57.360
try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people,

17:57.360 --> 18:03.120
and can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.240
No. No voting.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.080
Smashing.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.600
Well, you know what, since she's the one with the plan apparently,

18:11.600 --> 18:13.680
I guess just do whatever she says.

18:14.160 --> 18:18.080
♪ Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl ♪

18:18.080 --> 18:20.160
Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?

18:21.280 --> 18:21.780
Meow!

18:24.080 --> 18:25.120
Good kitty.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.480
Don't close the door!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.360
Dear Comrades,

18:27.360 --> 18:30.800
The Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.400
and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.920
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

18:37.920 --> 18:40.480
with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabbyism.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.840
Meow-meow-meow.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.140
Meow.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.480
Meow-meow-meow.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.040
Meow-meow-meow.
