1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,520
I like stuff. I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

2
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,760
I like stuff, and I want more stuff.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,160
My child, hearken to my voice. It is I, Socrates.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
Oh no. What do you want?

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,480
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late.

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Well yeah, because you kind of hate women, and it was getting me down.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,280
My child, without my guidance you have become a slave to mere appetite.

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,960
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness,

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
the rational contemplation of truth and justice?

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Look, I tried that, and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm a dum-dum, and I like shiny things.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
Ach, but my child, these are pleasures for the pigs.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself,

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,440
perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that into consideration.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
Ugh, Greeks.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,680
Look, we all have wants, needs, desires, and we all want happiness.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
But happiness, what does that word even mean?

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things,

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
and these are questions really better left to the philosophers,

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,120
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,840
of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced,

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
a series in multiple volumes that examines deeply

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
the concept of the fetishism of the commodity.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
I am of course talking about Worth It, a series on BuzzFeed Video

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,480
about three men who are younger than me who travel the world

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,520
and try different foods that cost different amounts of money,

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
and then say whether it was worth it.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
In each episode, they taste a type of food at three different restaurants

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
at three drastically different price points

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,960
to find out which one is the most worth it.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,720
For example, they compare a $2 pizza to a $2,000 pizza that's made of gold,

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,600
and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,840
and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,960
It is a lot of gold.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,640
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,760
A gonjapreneur!

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,480
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder,

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
but we intellectuals, well,

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,520
we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,760
We like to take it all in.

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,480
Ah!

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
The Worth It Boys, Andrew, Adam, Stephen,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,400
these are not mere content creators,

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,320
mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,600
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even,

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,720
and what they've accomplished on YouTube, quite honestly,

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,800
far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels, Lenin,

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukács,

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
Zarathustra, and even our dear bread mom Kropotkin.

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,600
I've of course read each of these great thinkers' complete works many,

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,400
many times, but I always come away dissatisfied,

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
and I find myself returning, yet again,

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,320
to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,960
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,640
Is it worth it?

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
We may never know.

59
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,880
Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
Which is the better deal?

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, according to Karl Marx,

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
On the one hand, there's the use value,

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
with every other commodity,

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
But let's not oversimplify things.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,520
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us,

72
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
the viewers of Worth It,

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
to understand the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,840
not as a mere hierarchical binary,

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,720
but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome,

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
a non-arborescent multiplicity with as many sinuous interconnections

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
as the truffles on the pizza itself.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Am I making myself clear?

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm not.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
and not actually helping me think through this any better.

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,640
So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,280
Fuck this!

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,200
I like stuff, and I like shiny things.

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Now that's something everyone can understand,

86
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,640
so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
I'll be developing in this video.

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
let's return to the question.

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny, so I do like that.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,400
But the pizza itself seems kind of gross.

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,280
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.

95
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

96
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
But Andrew and Steven sit there, with New York's financial district for a backdrop,

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

100
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm honestly speechless.

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,680
I feel weird.

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Is it the gold?

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,800
I just ate $250.

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
I feel kind of like I'm committing a crime.

105
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,640
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,560
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,280
isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,120
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,680
on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,520
Is there a name for that feeling?

111
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,040
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,320
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,560
a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.

114
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,920
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,

115
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,000
but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,840
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,

117
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
you have to understand it in the context of capitalism.

118
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,360
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,

120
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,400
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or healthcare, or golden nails.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,480
worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,400
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
seem not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene or even immoral.

126
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,680
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,320
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go

128
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,080
PIZZAS IN AFRICA COULD HAVE EATEN THOSE CHILDREN HOW DARE YOU

129
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Stephen are bad people

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,960
for buying inexpensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,120
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,640
these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

133
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,760
That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher Peter Singer,

134
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,200
who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved

135
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,640
and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.

137
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,600
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,480
but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,920
is structured around cheap exploited labor at the bottom and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

140
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask,

141
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,880
who are the goddamn reptiles?

142
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Well they're certainly not the Jews.

143
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page,

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,920
that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

145
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,760
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

147
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,680
So the lizards are not the Jews.

149
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
They're not Freemasons or globalists or the Gay Agenda.

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,040
But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.

152
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,160
The lizards are capital itself.

153
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
And what does that mean?

154
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,360
Well I don't know, but it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
are not just the product of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people, but some probably aren't.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,880
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

159
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,600
that the extreme economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

161
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,880
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument,

162
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
it would go something like this.

163
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,400
Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because,

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,720
although it's good at creating large amounts of wealth,

165
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,840
it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way,

166
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,160
where efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth,

167
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,960
but as the capacity to maximize human happiness.

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

169
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
Here's a question.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

171
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,280
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve humanity,

172
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,680
so what I look for in a good economic system

173
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
is that it produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of it.

174
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
So if you're willing to go along with this,

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
the first question we should ask is,

176
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,040
does having more wealth make people happier?

177
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
And we actually have data about that,

178
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,520
at least within the context of our own economic system,

179
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,240
and the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness up to a certain point.

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000 a year.

182
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,800
One interpretation of the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold

183
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
is that at lower income levels,

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,480
more income means less stress about paying rent or mortgages or medical bills or college tuition.

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
But once you pass the threshold,

186
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
more income basically just translates into more disappointing golden pizzas.

187
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,400
If that interpretation is correct,

188
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,920
then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

189
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,320
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

190
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme,

191
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,920
so that the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone,

192
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
but the national median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

193
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,120
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year,

194
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,760
several times the peak happiness threshold.

195
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
So at least to my naive eyes,

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,960
what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

197
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,240
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,

198
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
while a few million others are like,

199
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

200
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that,

201
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,

202
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,680
it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.

203
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,080
And since people compare themselves to others,

204
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,720
that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties and resentments and social tensions.

205
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
There's a study of Capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey

206
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
for a task with a delicious grape,

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,440
and a monkey in the adjacent cage with a shitty cucumber,

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,080
the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

209
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,240
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

210
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,000
But that's just how it looks to me.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880
I could be wrong.

212
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,040
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist,

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
and honestly, I don't really understand how the economy works.

214
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,640
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

216
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,080
So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually,

217
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,120
just leave a comment and I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

218
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,200
But before you do that, let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

219
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

220
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

221
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs

223
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
just to sustain themselves and their families.

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,960
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

225
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,600
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,640
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical researcher

227
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,720
if they could make a good living as a janitor?

228
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,400
Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.

229
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
Someone has to cook and clean,

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
and I think people who do such necessary work deserve a decent living.

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,960
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring,

232
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,560
and I think that the kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent

233
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,360
often isn't driven mainly by profit anyway.

234
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,160
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine,

235
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,400
even though he could have made millions of dollars from it,

236
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,560
because he just cared about humanity,

237
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,520
and he was driven by a purpose beyond personal profit.

238
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,200
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people

239
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
who didn't need to work for a living at all,

240
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

241
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
So let me get this straight.

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,040
You criticize capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

243
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Hypocrite much?

244
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student,

245
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
and when I criticized capitalism then, people used to say,

246
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,560
You just resent capitalism because you're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

248
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,280
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticize it because they're just resentful,

249
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,680
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticize it because they're hypocrites,

250
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,400
then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticize capitalism?

251
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,800
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

252
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,240
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

253
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,520
Well, no, I wouldn't.

254
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,280
Hello, I'm Tatyana Tankikova, I'm here to defend Stalin.

255
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,920
Fuck off!

256
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
Do svidaniya, fascist.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,520
So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty,

258
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,360
but that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.

259
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,160
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

260
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,600
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,640
Okay, but I like stuff.

262
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,160
I like stuff too.

263
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I think a lot of people have this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes,

264
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
so does everything we love.

265
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,280
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity, scarcity, conformity,

266
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,400
undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

267
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,840
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

268
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,960
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

269
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,480
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

270
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,640
But the stuff I'm worried about, booze, makeup, art, baths,

271
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,560
these things existed long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

272
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,840
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about,

273
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,880
straight guys will be like,

274
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,000
WILL THERE BE VIDEO GAMES AFTER CAPITALISM OH GOD

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
And yeah, there will be.

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,640
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

277
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
🎵Soviet anthem🎵

278
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved

279
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,080
if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

280
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,920
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

281
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,640
The last time I was reading the only book I've ever read,

282
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,720
Ways of Seeing by John Berger,

283
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,480
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

284
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

285
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

286
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

287
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,160
And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.

288
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
And by us, I mean the gays.

289
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,440
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.

290
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,400
But isn't it kind of true that, at least in advertising,

291
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,320
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy

292
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,800
in the beholder in the service of selling you shit?

293
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,480
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,

294
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
not something essential to it.

295
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,240
And maybe glamour would actually be liberated

296
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,640
if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

297
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,840
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,

298
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,520
actually, stuff is good.

299
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
Glamour is good.

300
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
Video games are good.

301
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,800
Luxury is good.

302
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,760
Baths are good.

303
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,520
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it horribly.

304
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,080
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza

305
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,600
is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.

306
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,080
The golden pizza is an affront not just to the people whose medical bills it could've paid,

307
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,960
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

308
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,760
So I guess my final take here is, actually, champagne socialism is good.

309
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,720
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

310
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

311
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Alright, now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,

312
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,320
I'm finally ready to get started.

313
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,800
Part 1, which you've all been waiting for.

314
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,280
How to end capitalism once and for all.

315
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
Well, I don't know.

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,320
Who do you people think I am?

317
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer, not transsexual Gandhi.

318
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,320
I mean, according to Marxism, we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

319
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,800
Capitalism has to fail, and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

320
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,240
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

321
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.

322
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

323
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,200
Uh, so, I don't know, I guess vote labor, tweet radically, try to eat more vegetables,

324
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,360
try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people,

325
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,120
and can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

326
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,240
No. No voting.

327
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
Smashing.

328
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,600
Well, you know what, since she's the one with the plan apparently,

329
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,680
I guess just do whatever she says.

330
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,080
♪ Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl, Rebel Girl ♪

331
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,780
Meow!

333
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
Good kitty.

334
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't close the door!

335
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,360
Dear Comrades,

336
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,800
The Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

337
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
and always has been, counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

338
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,920
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

339
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,480
with a tribute to the immortal science of Tabbyism.

340
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Meow-meow-meow.

341
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,140
Meow.

342
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Meow-meow-meow.

343
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,040
Meow-meow-meow.
