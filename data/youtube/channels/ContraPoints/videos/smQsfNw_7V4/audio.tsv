0	11520	All right, so what are we looking at?
11520	15360	What new hell have we sunk to now, here in the United States of-
15360	18160	They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not
18160	21440	really fine, but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.
21440	27240	Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter, thin blue line,
27240	29400	Punisher's skull on the hood.
29400	35440	Um, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining
35440	36440	the skull.
36440	41040	The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.
41040	45200	The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess
45200	47640	because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.
47640	48640	Disappointing.
48640	52540	Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him
52540	56600	an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.
56960	60840	There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher, and as research for this
60840	66920	video I did watch all of them, and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where
66920	71480	Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty
71480	75680	in the sewers worshipping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.
75680	78760	You know, just like the police do.
78760	84720	Hi, I'm Nyadily, creator of Catra Points.
84720	86440	And no, I'm not a cat girl.
86440	87440	I'm a cat woman.
87440	89160	I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.
89160	93800	Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite, heterosexual body.
93800	105160	I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and as a woman with values.
105160	106440	Just kidding, I'm trash.
106440	109000	Let's talk about justice, Ulu.
109000	112640	Justice is when I get lots of head pats, nyah.
112640	116920	The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family, but
116920	121000	once he gets revenge, he can't stop killing, because it's the only thing that gives meaning
121000	125120	to his shitty life, so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.
125120	129720	But no matter how many bad guys he kills, it's never enough, because new criminals
129720	133160	just come along and take the place of the old ones.
133160	138640	It's like a cycle, where violence begets violence, and nothing ever really changes.
139000	143240	It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime
143240	144240	and punishment.
144240	146360	But you know what, let's not overthink this.
146360	149160	Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.
149160	150160	Great.
150160	151160	Perfect.
151160	152160	Are we the baddies?
152160	158600	Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, antifa-sympathizing, big government
158600	164600	anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte, criticizing the police even though
164600	167720	I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.
167800	172240	And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.
172240	175560	This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.
175560	179200	There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose
179200	180840	of the chemical you're addicted to.
180840	183280	They tried to make me go to rehab, I said,
183280	184280	Nya?
184280	185280	Nya?
185280	186280	Nya?
186280	191960	But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free
191960	193920	marketplace of ideas gorge.
193920	198160	And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because
198160	200160	I happen to enjoy head pats.
200160	205240	As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher
205240	207160	king or a peasant knave.
207160	208160	Or a nekomimi.
208160	209160	Ha!
209160	210160	Kawaii dates?
210160	213520	Is this problematic?
213520	215600	Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.
215600	217240	This is beyond cringe.
217240	219640	This is cursed children, cursed.
219640	223800	So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but uh, that just proves
223800	227080	a point I'm making, so maybe you should hear me out, Nya?
227080	231560	I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared
231560	235520	on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police in prisons.
235520	240480	And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice
240480	246320	is taken into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.
246320	248840	All of this raises a lot of questions.
248840	252080	Questions like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?
252400	254400	Who should impose these consequences?
254400	256080	And under what circumstances?
256080	257480	And for what purpose?
257480	260920	If we were to abolish police in prisons, what would take their place?
260920	261920	Oh my god, these contacts.
261920	265080	I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.
265080	266080	Ridiculous.
266080	270600	Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice Socrates?
270600	274760	It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years, with no conclusive
274760	275760	answers.
275760	281520	I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers
281520	282520	were dummies.
282520	284480	And I am very smart.
284480	285480	Nya?
285480	286480	Ra-ra-rasputin?
286480	287480	1.
287480	288480	Revenge.
288480	294680	The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull
294680	300240	he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.
300240	304920	The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people, an eye for
304920	305920	an eye.
305920	311360	This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment
311360	312800	in proportion to their crime.
312800	317800	It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in
317800	321440	our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.
321440	326200	Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it
326200	328160	serves an evolutionary function.
328160	332640	If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas, and you don't get revenge,
332640	335680	then other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.
335680	340360	But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend
340360	345320	pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that
345320	348240	it is not profitable to mess with you.
348240	351880	So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.
351880	356080	And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is
356080	362000	strong, and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when
362000	364600	justice of this kind is served.
364600	369640	So of course there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.
369640	374360	For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served, with one and a half
374360	375360	million subscribers.
375360	381320	I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves
381320	386960	stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment, and all this celebrated under
386960	389520	the heading, police justice.
389520	394040	In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community
394040	397400	was, now with 20% more police brutality.
397400	401280	Um, fun fact, this ain't it, chief.
401280	402280	Period.
402280	403280	Full stop.
403280	404280	That's the tweet.
404280	408480	Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping
408480	409920	an eye on these people.
409920	412440	Here's a typical justice served post.
412440	420440	Woman sets P-E-D-O, husband, on fire after catching him R-A-P-E, seven-year-old daughter,
420440	423960	titled, this man got what he deserved.
423960	425720	Instant regret.
425720	426720	Editor exposed.
426720	430560	To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat
430560	431560	ears.
431560	434960	I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed
434960	440480	like an aging, bargain bin, Belle Delphine impersonator.
440480	443200	Well, dress for the job you want.
443200	447360	I mean, whomsta amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,
447360	448360	right?
448360	451760	Let's look at the comments on that post though, let's read the room.
451760	454280	She's a hero, in my opinion.
454280	456400	Should've had it live on television.
456400	457640	Give her a medal.
457640	458640	Give her two medals.
458640	464160	So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but there's always a couple buzzkills
464160	469480	in there, whining as usual about, oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning people
469480	472320	alive with no due process and no evidence.
472320	476400	Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.
476400	478640	But those people get shouted down pretty fast.
478640	479640	They get called pedo-simps.
479640	480640	Pedo-simp!
481360	482360	Pedo-simp!
482360	487760	So justice served is a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared
487760	489960	love of extrajudicial violence.
489960	494080	But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.
494080	498520	On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one
498520	504360	commenter says, that's a justice boner for me, I dream of the day I catch the thieves
504360	509160	that stole from me, and kick the life out of them.
509160	510440	Criminal fail.
510440	511800	Like gone wrong.
511800	519200	So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off-putting
519200	520580	to some people.
520580	525600	As one disgruntled former Justice Served subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos
525600	527720	of assholes getting their comeuppance.
527720	533560	Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.
533560	535160	Everything is black and white with them.
535160	539440	If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving
539440	542840	them a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.
542840	543840	Unsubscribed!
543840	549240	But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their
549240	550240	comeuppance.
550240	555520	I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.
555520	560400	There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games win stupid
560400	568200	prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced
568200	575160	to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people
575160	580360	getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right-wing feel
580360	586600	to it, unmarked police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes
586600	594600	shotgun blast to the balls, Arizona, just Arizona, what more is there to say, Arizona,
594600	595600	justice served.
595600	596600	Punished!
596600	600960	It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're gonna
600960	604600	kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this
604600	608080	longing for retribution is distinctively right-wing.
608080	613560	Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.
613560	618320	Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.
618320	623480	Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?
623480	624480	Karma.
624480	626480	But she got her husband fired.
626480	629880	Dumb bitch really should've minded her business, love to see it.
629880	635440	She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in
635440	638360	jail for at least six months.
638360	640520	Firing them was not enough.
640520	643720	Life in prison.
643720	646600	Life in prison.
646600	651720	An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his
651720	656200	power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced
656200	661440	to serve 263 years in prison.
661440	664840	He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.
664840	671240	And of course there's the much-savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.
671240	673640	Let's watch it now!
673640	679240	Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.
680240	683240	It's uh, Pepe's become kind of a symbol.
683240	684240	No!
684240	685240	No!
685240	686240	That was informative.
686240	692840	But let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people just enjoyed watching
692840	697640	an NAZI get what he deserves.
697640	698640	Justice served.
698640	699640	Punished.
699640	700640	Smashing.
700640	703640	Very happy they found you, dude.
703640	706280	Remember to smash subscribe.
706320	712520	So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically
712520	717080	a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.
717080	723160	The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing
723160	726080	the suffering of someone who deserves it.
726080	730760	Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.
730760	735480	The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and
735480	737720	someone who's hiding bodies in the crawlspace.
737720	742040	It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah?
742040	747240	But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.
747240	750280	It's why we love stories about revenge.
750280	756240	Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.
756240	760640	Much too good for children.
760640	765080	Revenge is such a popular plot line because it's easy for people to identify with a
765080	770600	revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles
770600	771680	of violence.
771680	775960	This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey, by Homer.
775960	777960	I stole this copy from my high school.
777960	779960	And I stole this copy from my college.
779960	781640	I still just read the Spark Notes.
781640	782640	Well let's read it now.
782640	785520	See I knew this would be useful someday.
785520	788280	God he's such a fuckboy.
788280	789840	What does Athena see in this man?
790240	791240	He must be really hot.
791240	793440	Okay, I'm ready for my book report.
793440	798520	So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to
798520	805960	the island of Ithaca after um, okay so in the prequel, Odysseus's shitty friend Menelaus
805960	810840	throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually
810840	812480	attracted to, how dare she.
812480	818120	So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would
818120	821120	do and blowing off some steam at Femboy's Symposium.
821120	825520	Anyway when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of
825520	830920	men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.
830920	835960	So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors
835960	837280	as payback.
837280	843000	And then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and he has them
843000	844000	all hanged.
844120	849560	And this one suitor, Melantheus, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose
849560	854520	and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.
854520	859960	In reading this I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?
859960	864400	Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?
864400	868080	I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kinda kills it for me.
868080	872080	I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause
872320	873800	men love hearing about assholes.
873800	875440	That's why they watch my channel.
875440	879920	But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.
879920	886400	The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his uh, his slaves.
886400	887400	Yikes.
887400	888400	Disappointing.
888400	891400	Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.
891400	893120	It isn't a good look.
893120	896320	Wow this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.
896320	899600	Oh my god this contact is fully horizontal.
899600	901920	This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.
902360	906160	It just seems disproportionate you know, like it's not even eye for an eye, because the
906160	909920	suitors didn't kill anyone, they were basically just rude to Odysseus.
909920	913800	But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.
913800	918880	They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it but
918880	919880	whatever we'll play along.
919880	922640	So that was an affront to Odysseus's honor.
922640	928360	And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.
928360	930840	Because this was a pre-legal society.
930840	936200	No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck twelve.
936200	941140	So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people from
941140	945760	stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing causing
945760	949560	them to murder each other, because back then honor was the only thing protecting people
949560	951460	from being taken advantage of.
951460	955700	If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themselves into your house and drinks
955700	960340	your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, because
960340	962260	then people will walk all over you.
962260	966940	So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person
966940	968380	who is not to be messed with.
968380	972100	It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.
972100	976860	Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.
976860	980260	It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.
980260	985900	We call it toxic masculinity now because in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.
985900	989260	We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.
989260	993980	If society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.
993980	996820	I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.
996820	1001540	Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Femboy Symposium.
1001540	1004540	Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.
1004540	1008980	But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not
1008980	1014820	an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve
1014820	1021140	conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.
1021140	1026380	It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.
1026380	1030300	And the poison is vengeance, justice served.
1030300	1034740	So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.
1034740	1039940	The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first
1039940	1042820	paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.
1042820	1043820	Research!
1043820	1045460	I am very smart, meow.
1045460	1050780	But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.
1050780	1054580	An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?
1054580	1059420	If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try
1059420	1061060	to get revenge by killing you.
1061060	1064180	It's a cycle, a cycle of smashing.
1064180	1068460	At the end of the Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together
1068460	1071260	and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.
1071260	1075060	And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,
1075060	1081620	who has an inexplicable ladyboner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him, by just making the
1081620	1084700	families forget that Odysseus killed their children.
1084700	1090340	So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence, but in reality, that
1090340	1094980	doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.
1094980	1099540	In Albania, there's an ancient code called the Canon, which requires a family to commit
1099540	1103600	murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.
1103600	1105640	Life for life, blood for blood.
1105640	1110420	This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,
1110420	1113780	and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of northern Albania.
1113780	1118340	There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the
1118340	1122420	rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,
1122420	1123780	they'll be murdered.
1123780	1128660	Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed
1128660	1132500	to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.
1132500	1136380	These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange
1136380	1137820	for getting to live as men.
1137820	1141980	There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially
1141980	1146520	recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name, uwu, act as head
1146520	1150800	of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges
1150800	1151800	of a man.
1151800	1154000	Extremely happy trans sounds, uwu.
1154000	1157960	I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have
1157960	1162720	been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to
1162720	1164320	support trans rights.
1164320	1167080	No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.
1167080	1170680	Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to provide for their family
1170680	1171680	because they were just too much for their feelings and their people.
1171680	1173920	Yeah I know that, sweaty, it was just a joke, okay, calm down.
1173920	1179520	Such cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,
1179520	1180520	religions.
1180520	1184840	I'm worried if I give a real example I'll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict
1184840	1191160	where I'm supposed to take a side, so, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that
1191160	1197040	the cat girls bomb the dog girls, and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that
1197040	1201960	cycle repeats for a few decades, and by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter
1201960	1207320	list of grievances against each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.
1207320	1209960	Extremely angry gay sounds, nyah.
1209960	1213680	So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.
1213680	1218240	It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.
1218240	1222960	So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos
1222960	1227680	caused by vengeance, and the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal
1227680	1228680	system.
1228680	1229680	2.
1229720	1230720	Distribution.
1230720	1236360	The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined the state as
1236360	1240720	the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.
1240720	1245720	In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long as they
1245720	1248040	do so in accordance with the code of honor.
1248040	1252320	But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.
1252320	1256480	In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law
1256480	1263680	codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as History Times.
1263680	1265920	The code of Hammurabi looked like this.
1265920	1271440	The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.
1271440	1276160	I mean it was like a thousand years ago so I'm sure they were doing their best.
1276160	1280000	It's very good sweetie, I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.
1280000	1282560	Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?
1282560	1285560	Sort of a spinal tap stonehenge situation?
1286160	1291400	The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall and they were publicly placed in
1291400	1294160	the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.
1294160	1297880	Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried sort of.
1297880	1299480	Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.
1299480	1300480	That's content right?
1300480	1303480	Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.
1303480	1306880	Niasqueen.
1306880	1308560	We don't deserve rights.
1308560	1314040	So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment
1314040	1315040	is Y.
1315040	1319360	222, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.
1319360	1321000	That's extremely valid.
1321000	1325200	If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother,
1325200	1329000	you are not my father or my mother, his tongue shall be cut off.
1329000	1331400	At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.
1331400	1335640	If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.
1335640	1338120	Now we're getting into some of the classics.
1338120	1341640	If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.
1341640	1347240	If a freedman strike the body of another freedman, he shall pay ten shekels in money.
1347240	1352760	But if the slave of a freedman strike the body of a freedman, his ear shall be cut off.
1352760	1355880	Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.
1355880	1358280	So it's like our legal system except honest.
1358280	1362520	If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house
1362520	1367200	which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.
1367200	1371720	If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.
1371720	1372720	Love that.
1372720	1378600	Okay, so by modern standards, the Code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.
1378600	1379880	The vibrations are very negative.
1379880	1383840	It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe
1383840	1384840	killer all around.
1384840	1389120	But you have to credit Hammurabi's Code for resolving the problem of honor-driven
1389120	1390120	revenge cycles.
1390120	1394360	You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against
1394360	1399960	their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the
1399960	1404600	elders of the city, who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.
1404600	1408840	So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante
1408840	1412440	revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.
1412440	1414360	Let's list all the differences.
1414360	1417880	Revenge is personal, in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.
1417880	1420720	It's often emotional, an act of passion.
1420720	1425960	It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace,
1425960	1426960	and it's sadistic.
1426960	1429440	It's satisfying to the avenger.
1429440	1430440	Revenge is sweet.
1430440	1435120	On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal, in the sense that the
1435120	1439120	punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.
1439120	1444240	It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion, and also lacking the
1444240	1446320	sadism of sweet revenge.
1446320	1449360	It's also proportionate, again in theory.
1449360	1453840	You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than
1453840	1458840	an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's
1458840	1460160	family for an eye.
1460160	1464800	And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for
1464800	1465800	the same crime.
1465800	1469320	I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about
1469320	1470640	it, just pay some gold.
1470640	1471640	It's fine.
1471640	1475000	Girl, these contacts, like.
1475000	1479840	So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which
1479840	1485240	is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.
1485240	1491000	Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.
1491000	1498520	However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.
1498520	1503040	It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.
1503080	1508760	If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.
1508760	1513720	In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out
1513720	1520480	the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of way.
1520480	1525760	Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body
1525760	1530200	part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the
1530200	1534480	breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced
1534480	1535480	its parents.
1535480	1540440	There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of
1540440	1541920	punishment and crime.
1541920	1547000	For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.
1547000	1551720	Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online, and then demands payment to take them down.
1551720	1554680	The site's founders were just arrested for extortion.
1554680	1555680	Here are their mugshots.
1556000	1561200	There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful
1561200	1562200	cosmic harmony.
1562200	1567040	And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct
1567040	1569160	that's difficult to get rid of.
1569160	1571960	But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.
1571960	1578080	The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years, by philosophers, reformists,
1578080	1584000	messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.
1584000	1589320	One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.
1589320	1594280	And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called Jesus
1594280	1595640	of Nazareth.
1595640	1600120	Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to
1600120	1601120	the Code of Hammurabi.
1601120	1606400	Like in the Book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches
1606400	1608480	of Hammurabi classics.
1608480	1612780	Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.
1612780	1616820	If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely, but
1616820	1621540	there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands
1621540	1622540	and the court allows.
1622540	1627780	But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for
1627780	1634180	tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,
1634180	1635980	head pats for head pats.
1635980	1639580	Welcome to Catholic Bible study, Neal.
1639580	1641620	Extremely devotional gay sounds, you loo.
1641620	1643700	I feel very spiritually aroused right now.
1643700	1645180	My third eye chakra?
1645180	1646180	Dripping.
1646180	1649860	Macaroni in a pot.
1649860	1650860	I need Jesus.
1650860	1651860	I'm so sorry.
1651860	1654140	So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.
1654140	1660620	It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.
1660620	1665020	But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.
1665020	1671820	In Matthew 26, 52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays
1671820	1673340	him, but Jesus says,
1673340	1676100	Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus.
1676100	1678700	All who draw the sword will die by the sword.
1678700	1683100	Some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced, even
1683100	1687460	to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism.
1687460	1691300	Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves?
1691300	1692300	Rethink this.
1692300	1693300	It gets worse.
1693300	1695980	In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says,
1695980	1699500	Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
1699500	1702380	Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.
1702380	1703380	No loving.
1703380	1704380	Smashing.
1704380	1708180	But maybe Jesus wasn't as literal-minded as that.
1708180	1713460	You know, religion is a very subjective thing, and I have my own Bible interpretations,
1713460	1720780	and my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.
1720780	1723180	Like consider Matthew 5, 38.
1723180	1725300	Why is no one talking about Matthew 5, 38?
1725300	1726300	Jesus says,
1726300	1727780	You have heard that it was said,
1727780	1729940	An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
1729940	1732660	But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer.
1732660	1736740	But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.
1736740	1740220	Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.
1740220	1743740	Someone strikes you across the face, and you go,
1743740	1744740	Ugh.
1744740	1751280	This is not pacifism, this is passive aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.
1751280	1758280	This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus
1758280	1763440	at face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response
1763440	1769600	to wrongdoing is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.
1769600	1776040	In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment
1776040	1779800	and anger that victims of injustice experience.
1779800	1784680	And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about
1784680	1789760	serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take care
1789760	1792240	of that when the day of judgment comes.
1792240	1796640	It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the idea of karma, which is like a
1796640	1803800	cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.
1803800	1805760	You reap what you sow, basically.
1805760	1811160	So maybe don't worry about injustice too much, because karma will take care of it.
1811160	1815680	This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just-world fallacy, the cognitive bias
1815680	1819080	that sees the world as inherently fair and good.
1819080	1820720	Everything happens for a reason.
1820720	1825080	If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say,
1825080	1829600	There's a special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.
1829600	1833680	And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished
1833680	1835460	by fire demons or whatever.
1835460	1842100	People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice.
1842100	1846300	In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.
1846300	1848620	Why do bad things happen to good people?
1848620	1851180	And the answer is, just don't worry about it.
1851180	1854140	It's part of God's plan, it'll all work out in the end.
1854140	1855140	It's fine.
1855140	1856140	Everything's fine.
1856140	1862220	The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very
1862220	1863460	not good.
1863460	1869620	In which case, you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe changing some things.
1869620	1874500	I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not-all-religion, and obviously many political activists have
1874500	1878580	been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.
1878580	1880780	3. Utilitarianism
1880780	1887300	So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as
1887300	1889580	something other than retaliation.
1889620	1895060	Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve
1895060	1898620	society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.
1898620	1903500	Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes
1903500	1907100	the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.
1907100	1912140	So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,
1912140	1916820	where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.
1916820	1921620	Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive
1921620	1927420	for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation
1927420	1931660	of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society.
1931660	1936220	A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than
1936220	1939620	retribution, which is very based in emotions.
1939620	1945020	Also the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense, even if you don't believe in free will.
1945020	1949140	Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their
1949140	1955220	actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior, and can be deserving of punishment.
1955220	1959900	Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems, well.
1959900	1964740	The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the
1964740	1969860	sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.
1969860	1971620	Which seems irrational, right?
1971620	1973100	To punish a force of nature?
1973220	1975500	Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!
1975500	1981220	It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our genetics,
1981220	1986980	our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus in our natal
1986980	1992580	chart, dry-oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that
1992580	1993580	into consideration.
1993580	1997540	Like, you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never
1997540	2002220	took you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion, through no fault of my own I was
2002220	2005620	high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor.
2005620	2010340	A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian, like prisons
2010340	2015140	are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.
2015140	2020100	But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are
2020100	2021540	not doing very much correcting.
2021540	2022540	I'm sorry.
2022540	2027740	In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,
2027740	2031340	and 76% are re-arrested within five years.
2031460	2035540	And just think about the way we talk about incarceration, like if someone really evil
2035540	2039900	gets a long sentence, we say, good, I hope he rots in prison.
2039900	2044060	Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, good,
2044060	2048980	the proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him
2048980	2051260	a contributing member of his community.
2051260	2055740	So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative
2055740	2059900	function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.
2059900	2065700	I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often
2065700	2068100	offensive to human emotions.
2068100	2071500	And you can say facts don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our legal
2071500	2076260	system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with you.
2076260	2081300	But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,
2081300	2082820	you want to set him on fire.
2082820	2087900	And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too.
2087900	2090300	A YouTuber called Jose has a video called
2090300	2092660	Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,
2092660	2096140	which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher
2096140	2098460	because they relate to his military background
2098460	2101500	while fantasizing about the moral simplicity
2101500	2102940	of his vigilantism.
2102940	2105980	Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans
2105980	2108980	who say things like, Castle doesn't see shades of gray,
2108980	2112020	which, unfortunately, the American justice system
2112020	2114360	is littered with, and which tends to slow down
2114360	2116780	and sometimes even hinder victims of crime
2116820	2118820	from getting the justice they deserve.
2118820	2120860	Frank Castle is the ultimate definition
2120860	2122820	of Occam's razor for the military.
2122820	2125060	Don't worry about uniforms, inspections,
2125060	2126860	or restrictive rules of engagement.
2126860	2130700	Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.
2130700	2131980	Any true warrior?
2131980	2133140	That's the dream.
2133140	2135620	So these cops and soldiers feel cramped
2135620	2138820	by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions
2138820	2142200	that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.
2142200	2145420	You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier
2145420	2147780	if it weren't for all these pesky laws.
2147780	2150780	There's a childish simplicity and dualism
2150780	2152340	to this moral worldview.
2152340	2155140	Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.
2155140	2157500	Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric
2157500	2160000	about how you need a good guy with a gun
2160000	2162260	to stop a bad guy with a gun.
2162260	2163580	They sound like eight-year-old boys
2163580	2165340	playing cops and robbers.
2165340	2167700	Good guys and bad guys.
2167700	2170260	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
2170260	2171900	That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.
2171900	2174100	And to be fair, I totally understand
2174100	2175700	the appeal of moral simplicity.
2175700	2177220	People love justice-served
2177220	2179700	and instant-karma videos for a reason.
2179700	2182300	We take satisfaction in swift,
2182300	2184820	decisive, elegant retribution.
2184820	2186780	But the procedures of law enforcement
2186780	2189300	and criminal justice don't allow for that.
2189300	2191300	There's all these tedious roadblocks.
2191300	2193860	Right to an attorney, right to remain silent,
2193860	2196800	right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.
2196800	2199280	A lot of police wish they could simplify things
2199280	2201620	by being judge, jury, and executioner.
2201620	2204140	But the function of police is supposed to be limited
2204140	2207540	to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations.
2207540	2210540	They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma
2210540	2212500	dispensing free-form retribution
2212500	2214980	in the streets at will, justice-served,
2214980	2217380	now with 20% more police brutality.
2217380	2219220	But a lot of people defend the police
2219220	2220540	when they behave like this
2220540	2222780	because the thin-wristed civilians
2222780	2224940	are just as emotionally frustrated
2224940	2227140	by due process as the cops.
2227140	2229940	Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?
2229940	2231100	I'm double-canceled.
2231100	2232860	Well, look, all lives are bastards,
2232860	2235100	but only some bastards are armed by the state
2235100	2237580	and licensed to go bastarding around town.
2237580	2240820	The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.
2240820	2242500	I also think there's a secular version
2242500	2244820	of the just world fallacy going on here.
2244820	2247820	People like to think that if the police kill somebody,
2247820	2250700	it must be because that person did something wrong.
2250700	2252900	Karma at work, justice served.
2252900	2256800	Victim-blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.
2256800	2258180	You get what you deserve,
2258180	2260860	so if something bad happens to you,
2261500	2262460	you must've been asking for it.
2262460	2264660	And obviously, racism is a huge part of this.
2264660	2266820	You know, there's structural white supremacy
2266820	2269060	that occupies black neighborhoods with police
2269060	2270900	instead of investing in communities.
2270900	2272700	And people are prejudiced and more likely
2272700	2274780	to think of black people as criminal thugs
2274780	2276980	and therefore deserving of police violence.
2276980	2278980	So we get this no-angel discourse
2278980	2280860	that comes up every time a black person
2280860	2282160	is murdered by the police,
2282160	2284300	where they bring up the victim's criminal record
2284300	2286500	or a picture of them looking like a scary thug,
2286500	2288980	as if that proves they deserved to die.
2288980	2290620	The problem with this, of course,
2291380	2293020	is that no one is an angel.
2293020	2295460	There are no angels walking this earth.
2295460	2297960	We're all flawed, we've all made mistakes,
2297960	2299740	we've all done bad things that doesn't mean
2299740	2301820	we deserve to die a violent death.
2301820	2303660	And then there's people like Breonna Taylor
2303660	2305820	and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know
2305820	2308420	were about as close to angels as humans come,
2308420	2310220	but that didn't protect them.
2310220	2312400	So that is 100% beside the point,
2312400	2313980	because black people in America
2313980	2316460	should not literally have to have white feather wings
2316460	2318220	and glowing halos to deserve
2318220	2319900	not to be murdered by the police.
2319900	2322500	In fact, people of all races have the absolute right
2322500	2324860	to be low-life, drug-addicted, petty criminals
2324860	2327020	who contribute absolutely nothing to society,
2327020	2329740	and yet still not be executed by the cops,
2329740	2331260	because that's what it's supposed to mean
2331260	2332820	to live in a free country.
2332820	2334540	So, things need to change.
2334540	2336300	The Punisher police have got to go,
2336300	2338540	and a lot of the rest of our justice system with them.
2338540	2341180	We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice,
2341180	2342980	and to be honest,
2342980	2345060	that might take more than one YouTube video.
2345060	2346020	I know at the beginning I said
2346020	2347700	I was gonna explain what justice is,
2347700	2351540	but I lied.
2353580	2355260	I'm sorry that I can't fix America.
2355260	2356620	I'm just a lonely cat.
2356620	2359980	I guess the only solution is revolution,
2359980	2361940	and by revolution, I do mean vote Democrat
2361940	2364780	and then bully the Democrats into actually doing something,
2364780	2368860	and if they don't listen, well...
2368860	2372340	Hang on, let me get this.
