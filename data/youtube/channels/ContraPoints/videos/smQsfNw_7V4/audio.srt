1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
All right, so what are we looking at?

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,360
What new hell have we sunk to now, here in the United States of-

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,440
really fine, but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter, thin blue line,

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,400
Punisher's skull on the hood.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,440
Um, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
the skull.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,040
The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,640
because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Disappointing.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,540
Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,600
an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,840
There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher, and as research for this

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,920
video I did watch all of them, and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,680
in the sewers worshipping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,760
You know, just like the police do.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,720
Hi, I'm Nyadily, creator of Catra Points.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
And no, I'm not a cat girl.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm a cat woman.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,160
I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,800
Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite, heterosexual body.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:45,160
I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and as a woman with values.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,440
Just kidding, I'm trash.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's talk about justice, Ulu.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Justice is when I get lots of head pats, nyah.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,920
The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family, but

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,000
once he gets revenge, he can't stop killing, because it's the only thing that gives meaning

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,120
to his shitty life, so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,720
But no matter how many bad guys he kills, it's never enough, because new criminals

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,160
just come along and take the place of the old ones.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,640
It's like a cycle, where violence begets violence, and nothing ever really changes.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,240
It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
and punishment.

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,360
But you know what, let's not overthink this.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,160
Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Great.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Perfect.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Are we the baddies?

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,600
Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, antifa-sympathizing, big government

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,600
anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte, criticizing the police even though

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,720
I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,240
And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,560
This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,200
There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,840
of the chemical you're addicted to.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,280
They tried to make me go to rehab, I said,

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Nya?

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Nya?

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Nya?

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,960
But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,920
marketplace of ideas gorge.

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,160
And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
I happen to enjoy head pats.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,240
As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
king or a peasant knave.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Or a nekomimi.

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Ha!

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Kawaii dates?

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,520
Is this problematic?

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,240
This is beyond cringe.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,640
This is cursed children, cursed.

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,800
So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but uh, that just proves

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,080
a point I'm making, so maybe you should hear me out, Nya?

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,520
on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police in prisons.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,480
And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice

71
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,320
is taken into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.

72
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,840
All of this raises a lot of questions.

73
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,080
Questions like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Who should impose these consequences?

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,080
And under what circumstances?

76
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,480
And for what purpose?

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,920
If we were to abolish police in prisons, what would take their place?

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Oh my god, these contacts.

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,080
I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Ridiculous.

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,600
Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice Socrates?

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,760
It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years, with no conclusive

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
answers.

84
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,520
I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
were dummies.

86
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,480
And I am very smart.

87
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Nya?

88
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Ra-ra-rasputin?

89
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
1.

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Revenge.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,680
The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,240
he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,920
The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people, an eye for

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
an eye.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,360
This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
in proportion to their crime.

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,440
our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,200
Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it

100
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
serves an evolutionary function.

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,640
If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas, and you don't get revenge,

102
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,680
then other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,360
But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,320
pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,240
it is not profitable to mess with you.

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,880
So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.

107
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,080
And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,000
strong, and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
justice of this kind is served.

110
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,640
So of course there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.

111
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,360
For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served, with one and a half

112
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
million subscribers.

113
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,320
I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves

114
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,960
stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment, and all this celebrated under

115
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
the heading, police justice.

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,040
In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community

117
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,400
was, now with 20% more police brutality.

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Um, fun fact, this ain't it, chief.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Period.

120
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Full stop.

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
That's the tweet.

122
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,480
Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping

123
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
an eye on these people.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,440
Here's a typical justice served post.

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Woman sets P-E-D-O, husband, on fire after catching him R-A-P-E, seven-year-old daughter,

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,960
titled, this man got what he deserved.

127
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,720
Instant regret.

128
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Editor exposed.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
ears.

131
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed

132
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,480
like an aging, bargain bin, Belle Delphine impersonator.

133
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,200
Well, dress for the job you want.

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,360
I mean, whomsta amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
right?

136
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,760
Let's look at the comments on that post though, let's read the room.

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,280
She's a hero, in my opinion.

138
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,400
Should've had it live on television.

139
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,640
Give her a medal.

140
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Give her two medals.

141
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,160
So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but there's always a couple buzzkills

142
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,480
in there, whining as usual about, oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning people

143
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,320
alive with no due process and no evidence.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,400
Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,640
But those people get shouted down pretty fast.

146
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
They get called pedo-simps.

147
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Pedo-simp!

148
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Pedo-simp!

149
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,760
So justice served is a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared

150
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,960
love of extrajudicial violence.

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,080
But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.

152
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,520
On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,360
commenter says, that's a justice boner for me, I dream of the day I catch the thieves

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,160
that stole from me, and kick the life out of them.

155
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
Criminal fail.

156
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
Like gone wrong.

157
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,200
So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off-putting

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,580
to some people.

159
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,600
As one disgruntled former Justice Served subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,720
of assholes getting their comeuppance.

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.

162
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,160
Everything is black and white with them.

163
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,440
If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,840
them a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.

165
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Unsubscribed!

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,240
But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their

167
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
comeuppance.

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,520
I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.

169
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,400
There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games win stupid

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,200
prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced

171
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,160
to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people

172
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,360
getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right-wing feel

173
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,600
to it, unmarked police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,600
shotgun blast to the balls, Arizona, just Arizona, what more is there to say, Arizona,

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
justice served.

176
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Punished!

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,960
It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're gonna

178
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,600
kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this

179
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,080
longing for retribution is distinctively right-wing.

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,560
Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.

181
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,320
Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,480
Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Karma.

184
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
But she got her husband fired.

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,880
Dumb bitch really should've minded her business, love to see it.

186
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,440
She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in

187
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,360
jail for at least six months.

188
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,520
Firing them was not enough.

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,720
Life in prison.

190
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Life in prison.

191
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,720
An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,200
power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced

193
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,440
to serve 263 years in prison.

194
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,840
He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.

195
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,240
And of course there's the much-savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.

196
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's watch it now!

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,240
Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.

198
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,240
It's uh, Pepe's become kind of a symbol.

199
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
No!

200
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
No!

201
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
That was informative.

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,840
But let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people just enjoyed watching

203
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,640
an NAZI get what he deserves.

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Justice served.

205
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Punished.

206
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Smashing.

207
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Very happy they found you, dude.

208
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Remember to smash subscribe.

209
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,520
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,080
a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.

211
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,160
The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing

212
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,080
the suffering of someone who deserves it.

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.

214
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,480
The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and

215
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,720
someone who's hiding bodies in the crawlspace.

216
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,040
It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah?

217
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,240
But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.

218
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,280
It's why we love stories about revenge.

219
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.

220
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,640
Much too good for children.

221
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,080
Revenge is such a popular plot line because it's easy for people to identify with a

222
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,600
revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles

223
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,680
of violence.

224
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,960
This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey, by Homer.

225
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I stole this copy from my high school.

226
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
And I stole this copy from my college.

227
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,640
I still just read the Spark Notes.

228
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Well let's read it now.

229
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,520
See I knew this would be useful someday.

230
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,280
God he's such a fuckboy.

231
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,840
What does Athena see in this man?

232
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
He must be really hot.

233
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay, I'm ready for my book report.

234
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,520
So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to

235
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,960
the island of Ithaca after um, okay so in the prequel, Odysseus's shitty friend Menelaus

236
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,840
throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually

237
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,480
attracted to, how dare she.

238
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,120
So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would

239
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
do and blowing off some steam at Femboy's Symposium.

240
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,520
Anyway when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of

241
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,920
men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.

242
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,960
So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,280
as payback.

244
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,000
And then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and he has them

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
all hanged.

246
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,560
And this one suitor, Melantheus, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose

247
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,520
and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.

248
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,960
In reading this I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?

249
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?

250
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,080
I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kinda kills it for me.

251
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause

252
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,800
men love hearing about assholes.

253
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,440
That's why they watch my channel.

254
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.

255
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,400
The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his uh, his slaves.

256
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Yikes.

257
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Disappointing.

258
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.

259
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,120
It isn't a good look.

260
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
Wow this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.

261
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
Oh my god this contact is fully horizontal.

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.

263
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,160
It just seems disproportionate you know, like it's not even eye for an eye, because the

264
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,920
suitors didn't kill anyone, they were basically just rude to Odysseus.

265
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,800
But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.

266
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,880
They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it but

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
whatever we'll play along.

268
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,640
So that was an affront to Odysseus's honor.

269
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,360
And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,840
Because this was a pre-legal society.

271
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,200
No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck twelve.

272
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,140
So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people from

273
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,760
stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing causing

274
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,560
them to murder each other, because back then honor was the only thing protecting people

275
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,460
from being taken advantage of.

276
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,700
If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themselves into your house and drinks

277
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,340
your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, because

278
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,260
then people will walk all over you.

279
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,940
So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person

280
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,380
who is not to be messed with.

281
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,100
It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.

282
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,860
Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.

283
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,260
It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.

284
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,900
We call it toxic masculinity now because in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.

285
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,260
We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.

286
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,980
If society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.

287
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,820
I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.

288
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,540
Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Femboy Symposium.

289
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.

290
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,980
But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not

291
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,820
an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve

292
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:01,140
conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.

293
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,380
It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.

294
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,300
And the poison is vengeance, justice served.

295
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,740
So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.

296
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,940
The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first

297
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,820
paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.

298
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Research!

299
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,460
I am very smart, meow.

300
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,780
But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.

301
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,580
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?

302
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,420
If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try

303
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,060
to get revenge by killing you.

304
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,180
It's a cycle, a cycle of smashing.

305
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,460
At the end of the Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together

306
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,260
and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.

307
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,060
And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,

308
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,620
who has an inexplicable ladyboner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him, by just making the

309
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,700
families forget that Odysseus killed their children.

310
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,340
So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence, but in reality, that

311
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,980
doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.

312
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,540
In Albania, there's an ancient code called the Canon, which requires a family to commit

313
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,600
murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.

314
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Life for life, blood for blood.

315
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,420
This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,

316
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,780
and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of northern Albania.

317
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,340
There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the

318
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,420
rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,

319
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,780
they'll be murdered.

320
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,660
Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed

321
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,500
to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.

322
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,380
These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange

323
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,820
for getting to live as men.

324
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,980
There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially

325
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,520
recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name, uwu, act as head

326
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,800
of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges

327
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
of a man.

328
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Extremely happy trans sounds, uwu.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,960
I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have

330
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,720
been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to

331
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
support trans rights.

332
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,080
No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.

333
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,680
Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to provide for their family

334
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
because they were just too much for their feelings and their people.

335
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
Yeah I know that, sweaty, it was just a joke, okay, calm down.

336
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,520
Such cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,

337
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
religions.

338
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,840
I'm worried if I give a real example I'll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict

339
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,160
where I'm supposed to take a side, so, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that

340
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,040
the cat girls bomb the dog girls, and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that

341
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,960
cycle repeats for a few decades, and by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter

342
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,320
list of grievances against each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.

343
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Extremely angry gay sounds, nyah.

344
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,680
So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,240
It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.

346
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,960
So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos

347
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,680
caused by vengeance, and the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal

348
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
system.

349
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
2.

350
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Distribution.

351
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,360
The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined the state as

352
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,720
the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.

353
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,720
In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long as they

354
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,040
do so in accordance with the code of honor.

355
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,320
But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.

356
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,480
In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law

357
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,680
codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as History Times.

358
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,920
The code of Hammurabi looked like this.

359
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,440
The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.

360
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,160
I mean it was like a thousand years ago so I'm sure they were doing their best.

361
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,000
It's very good sweetie, I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.

362
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,560
Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?

363
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Sort of a spinal tap stonehenge situation?

364
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,400
The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall and they were publicly placed in

365
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,160
the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.

366
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,880
Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried sort of.

367
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.

368
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
That's content right?

369
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.

370
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,880
Niasqueen.

371
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,560
We don't deserve rights.

372
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,040
So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment

373
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
is Y.

374
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,360
222, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.

375
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,000
That's extremely valid.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,200
If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother,

377
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,000
you are not my father or my mother, his tongue shall be cut off.

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.

379
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,640
If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.

380
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,120
Now we're getting into some of the classics.

381
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,640
If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.

382
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,240
If a freedman strike the body of another freedman, he shall pay ten shekels in money.

383
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,760
But if the slave of a freedman strike the body of a freedman, his ear shall be cut off.

384
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,880
Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.

385
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,280
So it's like our legal system except honest.

386
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,520
If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house

387
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,200
which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.

388
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,720
If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.

389
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Love that.

390
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,600
Okay, so by modern standards, the Code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.

391
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,880
The vibrations are very negative.

392
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,840
It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe

393
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
killer all around.

394
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,120
But you have to credit Hammurabi's Code for resolving the problem of honor-driven

395
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
revenge cycles.

396
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,360
You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against

397
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,960
their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the

398
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,600
elders of the city, who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.

399
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,840
So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante

400
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,440
revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.

401
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,360
Let's list all the differences.

402
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,880
Revenge is personal, in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.

403
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,720
It's often emotional, an act of passion.

404
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,960
It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace,

405
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
and it's sadistic.

406
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
It's satisfying to the avenger.

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Revenge is sweet.

408
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,120
On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal, in the sense that the

409
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.

410
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,240
It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion, and also lacking the

411
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
sadism of sweet revenge.

412
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
It's also proportionate, again in theory.

413
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,840
You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than

414
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,840
an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's

415
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,160
family for an eye.

416
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,800
And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for

417
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
the same crime.

418
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,320
I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about

419
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,640
it, just pay some gold.

420
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
It's fine.

421
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,000
Girl, these contacts, like.

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,840
So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which

423
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,240
is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.

424
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,000
Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.

425
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,520
However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.

426
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,040
It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.

427
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,760
If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.

428
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,720
In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out

429
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,480
the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of way.

430
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body

431
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,200
part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the

432
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,480
breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced

433
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
its parents.

434
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,440
There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of

435
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,920
punishment and crime.

436
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,000
For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.

437
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,720
Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online, and then demands payment to take them down.

438
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,680
The site's founders were just arrested for extortion.

439
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Here are their mugshots.

440
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,200
There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful

441
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
cosmic harmony.

442
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,040
And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct

443
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,160
that's difficult to get rid of.

444
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,960
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.

445
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,080
The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years, by philosophers, reformists,

446
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,000
messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.

447
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,320
One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.

448
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,280
And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called Jesus

449
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,640
of Nazareth.

450
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,120
Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to

451
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
the Code of Hammurabi.

452
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Like in the Book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches

453
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,480
of Hammurabi classics.

454
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,780
Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.

455
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,820
If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely, but

456
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,540
there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands

457
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
and the court allows.

458
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,780
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for

459
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:14,180
tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,

460
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,980
head pats for head pats.

461
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,580
Welcome to Catholic Bible study, Neal.

462
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,620
Extremely devotional gay sounds, you loo.

463
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,700
I feel very spiritually aroused right now.

464
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,180
My third eye chakra?

465
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Dripping.

466
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,860
Macaroni in a pot.

467
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
I need Jesus.

468
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
I'm so sorry.

469
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,140
So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.

470
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,620
It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.

471
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,020
But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.

472
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,820
In Matthew 26, 52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays

473
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,340
him, but Jesus says,

474
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,100
Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus.

475
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,700
All who draw the sword will die by the sword.

476
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,100
Some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced, even

477
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,460
to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism.

478
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,300
Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves?

479
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Rethink this.

480
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
It gets worse.

481
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,980
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says,

482
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,500
Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.

483
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,380
Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.

484
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
No loving.

485
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,380
Smashing.

486
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,180
But maybe Jesus wasn't as literal-minded as that.

487
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,460
You know, religion is a very subjective thing, and I have my own Bible interpretations,

488
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,780
and my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.

489
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,180
Like consider Matthew 5, 38.

490
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,300
Why is no one talking about Matthew 5, 38?

491
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Jesus says,

492
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,780
You have heard that it was said,

493
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,940
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

494
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,660
But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer.

495
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,740
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.

496
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,220
Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.

497
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,740
Someone strikes you across the face, and you go,

498
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,740
Ugh.

499
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:11,280
This is not pacifism, this is passive aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.

500
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:18,280
This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus

501
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,440
at face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response

502
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,600
to wrongdoing is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.

503
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,040
In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment

504
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,800
and anger that victims of injustice experience.

505
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,680
And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about

506
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,760
serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take care

507
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
of that when the day of judgment comes.

508
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,640
It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the idea of karma, which is like a

509
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,800
cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.

510
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,760
You reap what you sow, basically.

511
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,160
So maybe don't worry about injustice too much, because karma will take care of it.

512
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,680
This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just-world fallacy, the cognitive bias

513
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,080
that sees the world as inherently fair and good.

514
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Everything happens for a reason.

515
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,080
If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say,

516
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,600
There's a special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.

517
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,680
And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished

518
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,460
by fire demons or whatever.

519
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:42,100
People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice.

520
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,300
In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.

521
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,620
Why do bad things happen to good people?

522
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,180
And the answer is, just don't worry about it.

523
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,140
It's part of God's plan, it'll all work out in the end.

524
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
It's fine.

525
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Everything's fine.

526
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:02,220
The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very

527
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,460
not good.

528
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:09,620
In which case, you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe changing some things.

529
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,500
I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not-all-religion, and obviously many political activists have

530
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,580
been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.

531
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,780
3. Utilitarianism

532
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:27,300
So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as

533
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,580
something other than retaliation.

534
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,060
Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve

535
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,620
society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.

536
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,500
Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes

537
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,100
the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.

538
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,140
So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,

539
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,820
where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.

540
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,620
Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive

541
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,420
for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation

542
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,660
of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society.

543
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,220
A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than

544
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,620
retribution, which is very based in emotions.

545
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,020
Also the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense, even if you don't believe in free will.

546
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,140
Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their

547
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,220
actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior, and can be deserving of punishment.

548
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,900
Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems, well.

549
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,740
The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the

550
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,860
sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.

551
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,620
Which seems irrational, right?

552
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,100
To punish a force of nature?

553
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,500
Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!

554
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,220
It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our genetics,

555
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,980
our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus in our natal

556
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,580
chart, dry-oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that

557
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,580
into consideration.

558
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,540
Like, you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never

559
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,220
took you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion, through no fault of my own I was

560
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,620
high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor.

561
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,340
A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian, like prisons

562
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:35,140
are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.

563
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:40,100
But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are

564
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,540
not doing very much correcting.

565
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm sorry.

566
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,740
In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,

567
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,340
and 76% are re-arrested within five years.

568
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,540
And just think about the way we talk about incarceration, like if someone really evil

569
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,900
gets a long sentence, we say, good, I hope he rots in prison.

570
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,060
Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, good,

571
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,980
the proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him

572
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,260
a contributing member of his community.

573
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,740
So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative

574
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,900
function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.

575
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,700
I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often

576
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,100
offensive to human emotions.

577
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,500
And you can say facts don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our legal

578
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,260
system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with you.

579
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,300
But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,

580
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,820
you want to set him on fire.

581
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,900
And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too.

582
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,300
A YouTuber called Jose has a video called

583
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,660
Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,

584
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,140
which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher

585
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,460
because they relate to his military background

586
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,500
while fantasizing about the moral simplicity

587
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,940
of his vigilantism.

588
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,980
Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans

589
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,980
who say things like, Castle doesn't see shades of gray,

590
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,020
which, unfortunately, the American justice system

591
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,360
is littered with, and which tends to slow down

592
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,780
and sometimes even hinder victims of crime

593
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,820
from getting the justice they deserve.

594
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,860
Frank Castle is the ultimate definition

595
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,820
of Occam's razor for the military.

596
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,060
Don't worry about uniforms, inspections,

597
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,860
or restrictive rules of engagement.

598
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,700
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.

599
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,980
Any true warrior?

600
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,140
That's the dream.

601
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,620
So these cops and soldiers feel cramped

602
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,820
by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions

603
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,200
that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.

604
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,420
You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier

605
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,780
if it weren't for all these pesky laws.

606
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,780
There's a childish simplicity and dualism

607
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,340
to this moral worldview.

608
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,140
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.

609
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,500
Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric

610
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,000
about how you need a good guy with a gun

611
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,260
to stop a bad guy with a gun.

612
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,580
They sound like eight-year-old boys

613
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,340
playing cops and robbers.

614
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,700
Good guys and bad guys.

615
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,260
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

616
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,900
That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.

617
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,100
And to be fair, I totally understand

618
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,700
the appeal of moral simplicity.

619
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,220
People love justice-served

620
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,700
and instant-karma videos for a reason.

621
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,300
We take satisfaction in swift,

622
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,820
decisive, elegant retribution.

623
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,780
But the procedures of law enforcement

624
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,300
and criminal justice don't allow for that.

625
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
There's all these tedious roadblocks.

626
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,860
Right to an attorney, right to remain silent,

627
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,800
right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.

628
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,280
A lot of police wish they could simplify things

629
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,620
by being judge, jury, and executioner.

630
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,140
But the function of police is supposed to be limited

631
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,540
to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations.

632
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,540
They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma

633
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,500
dispensing free-form retribution

634
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,980
in the streets at will, justice-served,

635
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,380
now with 20% more police brutality.

636
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,220
But a lot of people defend the police

637
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,540
when they behave like this

638
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,780
because the thin-wristed civilians

639
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,940
are just as emotionally frustrated

640
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,140
by due process as the cops.

641
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,940
Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?

642
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,100
I'm double-canceled.

643
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,860
Well, look, all lives are bastards,

644
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,100
but only some bastards are armed by the state

645
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,580
and licensed to go bastarding around town.

646
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,820
The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.

647
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,500
I also think there's a secular version

648
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,820
of the just world fallacy going on here.

649
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,820
People like to think that if the police kill somebody,

650
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,700
it must be because that person did something wrong.

651
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,900
Karma at work, justice served.

652
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,800
Victim-blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.

653
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,180
You get what you deserve,

654
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,860
so if something bad happens to you,

655
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,460
you must've been asking for it.

656
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,660
And obviously, racism is a huge part of this.

657
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,820
You know, there's structural white supremacy

658
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,060
that occupies black neighborhoods with police

659
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,900
instead of investing in communities.

660
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,700
And people are prejudiced and more likely

661
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,780
to think of black people as criminal thugs

662
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,980
and therefore deserving of police violence.

663
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
So we get this no-angel discourse

664
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,860
that comes up every time a black person

665
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,160
is murdered by the police,

666
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,300
where they bring up the victim's criminal record

667
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,500
or a picture of them looking like a scary thug,

668
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,980
as if that proves they deserved to die.

669
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,620
The problem with this, of course,

670
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,020
is that no one is an angel.

671
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,460
There are no angels walking this earth.

672
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,960
We're all flawed, we've all made mistakes,

673
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,740
we've all done bad things that doesn't mean

674
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,820
we deserve to die a violent death.

675
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,660
And then there's people like Breonna Taylor

676
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,820
and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know

677
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,420
were about as close to angels as humans come,

678
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,220
but that didn't protect them.

679
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,400
So that is 100% beside the point,

680
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,980
because black people in America

681
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,460
should not literally have to have white feather wings

682
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,220
and glowing halos to deserve

683
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,900
not to be murdered by the police.

684
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,500
In fact, people of all races have the absolute right

685
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,860
to be low-life, drug-addicted, petty criminals

686
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,020
who contribute absolutely nothing to society,

687
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,740
and yet still not be executed by the cops,

688
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,260
because that's what it's supposed to mean

689
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,820
to live in a free country.

690
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,540
So, things need to change.

691
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,300
The Punisher police have got to go,

692
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,540
and a lot of the rest of our justice system with them.

693
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,180
We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice,

694
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,980
and to be honest,

695
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,060
that might take more than one YouTube video.

696
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,020
I know at the beginning I said

697
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,700
I was gonna explain what justice is,

698
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,540
but I lied.

699
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,260
I'm sorry that I can't fix America.

700
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm just a lonely cat.

701
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,980
I guess the only solution is revolution,

702
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,940
and by revolution, I do mean vote Democrat

703
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,780
and then bully the Democrats into actually doing something,

704
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,860
and if they don't listen, well...

705
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,340
Hang on, let me get this.

706
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,940
Moshi moshi.

707
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,420
Hey, how are you days?

708
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,980
