WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
All right, so what are we looking at?

00:11.520 --> 00:15.360
What new hell have we sunk to now, here in the United States of-

00:15.360 --> 00:18.160
They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not

00:18.160 --> 00:21.440
really fine, but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.240
Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter, thin blue line,

00:27.240 --> 00:29.400
Punisher's skull on the hood.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.440
Um, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's stick to tradition and begin by examining

00:35.440 --> 00:36.440
the skull.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.040
The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics vigilante anti-hero.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.200
The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to Frank Castle, I guess

00:45.200 --> 00:47.640
because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Disappointing.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.540
Frank Castle is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him

00:52.540 --> 00:56.600
an empty husk of a man whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.840
There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher, and as research for this

01:00.840 --> 01:06.920
video I did watch all of them, and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where

01:06.920 --> 01:11.480
Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty

01:11.480 --> 01:15.680
in the sewers worshipping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.760
You know, just like the police do.

01:18.760 --> 01:24.720
Hi, I'm Nyadily, creator of Catra Points.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.440
And no, I'm not a cat girl.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.440
I'm a cat woman.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.160
I'm sorry you're intimidated by that.

01:29.160 --> 01:33.800
Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite, heterosexual body.

01:33.800 --> 01:45.160
I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and as a woman with values.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.440
Just kidding, I'm trash.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.000
Let's talk about justice, Ulu.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.640
Justice is when I get lots of head pats, nyah.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.920
The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family, but

01:56.920 --> 02:01.000
once he gets revenge, he can't stop killing, because it's the only thing that gives meaning

02:01.000 --> 02:05.120
to his shitty life, so he wages a one-man war on organized crime.

02:05.120 --> 02:09.720
But no matter how many bad guys he kills, it's never enough, because new criminals

02:09.720 --> 02:13.160
just come along and take the place of the old ones.

02:13.160 --> 02:18.640
It's like a cycle, where violence begets violence, and nothing ever really changes.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.240
It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
and punishment.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.360
But you know what, let's not overthink this.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.160
Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.160
Great.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.160
Perfect.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
Are we the baddies?

02:32.160 --> 02:38.600
Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarted, antifa-sympathizing, big government

02:38.600 --> 02:44.600
anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte, criticizing the police even though

02:44.600 --> 02:47.720
I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.240
And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.560
This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.200
There's just nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose

02:59.200 --> 03:00.840
of the chemical you're addicted to.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.280
They tried to make me go to rehab, I said,

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
Nya?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
Nya?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.280
Nya?

03:06.280 --> 03:11.960
But you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the free

03:11.960 --> 03:13.920
marketplace of ideas gorge.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.160
And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't dismiss my argument just because

03:18.160 --> 03:20.160
I happen to enjoy head pats.

03:20.160 --> 03:25.240
As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true whether uttered by a philosopher

03:25.240 --> 03:27.160
king or a peasant knave.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
Or a nekomimi.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
Ha!

03:29.160 --> 03:30.160
Kawaii dates?

03:30.160 --> 03:33.520
Is this problematic?

03:33.520 --> 03:35.600
Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.240
This is beyond cringe.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.640
This is cursed children, cursed.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.800
So actually Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but uh, that just proves

03:43.800 --> 03:47.080
a point I'm making, so maybe you should hear me out, Nya?

03:47.080 --> 03:51.560
I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared

03:51.560 --> 03:55.520
on social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police in prisons.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.480
And at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice

04:00.480 --> 04:06.320
is taken into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.840
All of this raises a lot of questions.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.080
Questions like, what should the consequences be for bad behavior?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
Who should impose these consequences?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.080
And under what circumstances?

04:16.080 --> 04:17.480
And for what purpose?

04:17.480 --> 04:20.920
If we were to abolish police in prisons, what would take their place?

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
Oh my god, these contacts.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.080
I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
Ridiculous.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.600
Why don't we start with the basics and ask ourselves, what is justice Socrates?

04:30.600 --> 04:34.760
It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years, with no conclusive

04:34.760 --> 04:35.760
answers.

04:35.760 --> 04:41.520
I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video, because the philosophers

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
were dummies.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.480
And I am very smart.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
Nya?

04:45.480 --> 04:46.480
Ra-ra-rasputin?

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
1.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
Revenge.

04:48.480 --> 04:54.680
The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull

04:54.680 --> 05:00.240
he wears on his t-shirt so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.920
The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people, an eye for

05:04.920 --> 05:05.920
an eye.

05:05.920 --> 05:11.360
This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment

05:11.360 --> 05:12.800
in proportion to their crime.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.800
It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in

05:17.800 --> 05:21.440
our instinct to strike back at someone who's harmed us.

05:21.440 --> 05:26.200
Social animals like humans and chimpanzees often practice revenge, probably because it

05:26.200 --> 05:28.160
serves an evolutionary function.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.640
If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas, and you don't get revenge,

05:32.640 --> 05:35.680
then other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.360
But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by, I don't know, letting her boyfriend

05:40.360 --> 05:45.320
pick parasites out of your fur, then that sends a message to the other monkeys that

05:45.320 --> 05:48.240
it is not profitable to mess with you.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.880
So our little monkey brains have evolved a taste for vengeance.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.080
And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us, our desire for retribution is

05:56.080 --> 06:02.000
strong, and our little monkey brains reward us with a pleasant feeling of catharsis when

06:02.000 --> 06:04.600
justice of this kind is served.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.640
So of course there's a lot of content out there devoted to scratching this itch.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.360
For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served, with one and a half

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
million subscribers.

06:15.360 --> 06:21.320
I first found justice served when the popular feed showed me this post of two teenage thieves

06:21.320 --> 06:26.960
stripped naked, humiliated, and photographed as punishment, and all this celebrated under

06:26.960 --> 06:29.520
the heading, police justice.

06:29.520 --> 06:34.040
In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police, the description of the community

06:34.040 --> 06:37.400
was, now with 20% more police brutality.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.280
Um, fun fact, this ain't it, chief.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.280
Period.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.280
Full stop.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.280
That's the tweet.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.480
Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away, thinking someone should be keeping

06:48.480 --> 06:49.920
an eye on these people.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.440
Here's a typical justice served post.

06:52.440 --> 07:00.440
Woman sets P-E-D-O, husband, on fire after catching him R-A-P-E, seven-year-old daughter,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.960
titled, this man got what he deserved.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.720
Instant regret.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
Editor exposed.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.560
To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script, I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
ears.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.960
I'm really out here trying to have a conversation about immolating sex offenders while dressed

07:14.960 --> 07:20.480
like an aging, bargain bin, Belle Delphine impersonator.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.200
Well, dress for the job you want.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.360
I mean, whomsta amongst us wouldn't set their husband on fire under those circumstances,

07:27.360 --> 07:28.360
right?

07:28.360 --> 07:31.760
Let's look at the comments on that post though, let's read the room.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.280
She's a hero, in my opinion.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.400
Should've had it live on television.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.640
Give her a medal.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
Give her two medals.

07:38.640 --> 07:44.160
So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze, but there's always a couple buzzkills

07:44.160 --> 07:49.480
in there, whining as usual about, oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning people

07:49.480 --> 07:52.320
alive with no due process and no evidence.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.400
Lots of men like to fuck my wife because I'm too busy crying about due process.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.640
But those people get shouted down pretty fast.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.640
They get called pedo-simps.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.640
Pedo-simp!

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
Pedo-simp!

08:02.360 --> 08:07.760
So justice served is a community for people to gather together and bond over our shared

08:07.760 --> 08:09.960
love of extrajudicial violence.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.080
But of course there's always someone who takes it a little too far.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.520
On this video of a thief being kicked in the head until his face is a bloody pulp, one

08:18.520 --> 08:24.360
commenter says, that's a justice boner for me, I dream of the day I catch the thieves

08:24.360 --> 08:29.160
that stole from me, and kick the life out of them.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.440
Criminal fail.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.800
Like gone wrong.

08:31.800 --> 08:39.200
So when the righteous zeal for justice becomes the cloak of bloodlust, that is off-putting

08:39.200 --> 08:40.580
to some people.

08:40.580 --> 08:45.600
As one disgruntled former Justice Served subscriber put it, I wanted to see stories and videos

08:45.600 --> 08:47.720
of assholes getting their comeuppance.

08:47.720 --> 08:53.560
Instead, I got bombarded with an angry, toxic moral absolutism.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.160
Everything is black and white with them.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.440
If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair, then you must support giving

08:59.440 --> 09:02.840
them a slap on the wrist and letting them fuck your wife.

09:02.840 --> 09:03.840
Unsubscribed!

09:03.840 --> 09:09.240
But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch videos of assholes getting their

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
comeuppance.

09:10.240 --> 09:15.520
I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying some version of this type of content.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.400
There's a lot of subgenres, you've got justice porn, play stupid games win stupid

09:20.400 --> 09:28.200
prizes, instant karma, bad parking revenge, predator poaching, serial killer sentenced

09:28.200 --> 09:35.160
to death and the whole train clapped, instant justice was served, karma fails, stupid people

09:35.160 --> 09:40.360
getting what they deserved, karma, a lot of this content has kind of a right-wing feel

09:40.360 --> 09:46.600
to it, unmarked police justice, criminal gets shot after fighting cop, home invader takes

09:46.600 --> 09:54.600
shotgun blast to the balls, Arizona, just Arizona, what more is there to say, Arizona,

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
justice served.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
Punished!

09:56.600 --> 10:00.960
It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day fantasizing about how they're gonna

10:00.960 --> 10:04.600
kill home intruders with the gun they keep in the bathroom, but I don't think this

10:04.600 --> 10:08.080
longing for retribution is distinctively right-wing.

10:08.080 --> 10:13.560
Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response, they just have it in different situations.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.320
Think about the jubilation on Twitter when they get a racist Karen fired.

10:18.320 --> 10:23.480
Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man in front of an apartment building?

10:23.480 --> 10:24.480
Karma.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.480
But she got her husband fired.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.880
Dumb bitch really should've minded her business, love to see it.

10:29.880 --> 10:35.440
She will probably end up with community service and a fine, but I would love to see her in

10:35.440 --> 10:38.360
jail for at least six months.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.520
Firing them was not enough.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.720
Life in prison.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.600
Life in prison.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.720
An example I personally enjoy is that video of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his

10:51.720 --> 10:56.200
power to sexually assault a series of black women, crying in court as he's sentenced

10:56.200 --> 11:01.440
to serve 263 years in prison.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.840
He just cannot believe that he's actually facing consequences for this.

11:04.840 --> 11:11.240
And of course there's the much-savored vigilante punching of NAZI Richard Spencer.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.640
Let's watch it now!

11:13.640 --> 11:19.240
Please try not to enjoy this, remember this is purely for educational, monetizable purposes.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.240
It's uh, Pepe's become kind of a symbol.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.240
No!

11:24.240 --> 11:25.240
No!

11:25.240 --> 11:26.240
That was informative.

11:26.240 --> 11:32.840
But let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular is people just enjoyed watching

11:32.840 --> 11:37.640
an NAZI get what he deserves.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.640
Justice served.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.640
Punished.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.640
Smashing.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.640
Very happy they found you, dude.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.280
Remember to smash subscribe.

11:46.320 --> 11:52.520
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still basically

11:52.520 --> 11:57.080
a situational form of sadism, of schadenfreude.

11:57.080 --> 12:03.160
The satisfaction of justice served is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing

12:03.160 --> 12:06.080
the suffering of someone who deserves it.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.760
Now the phrase deserves it is doing a lot of work here.

12:10.760 --> 12:15.480
The correct use of that phrase is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person and

12:15.480 --> 12:17.720
someone who's hiding bodies in the crawlspace.

12:17.720 --> 12:22.040
It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah?

12:22.040 --> 12:27.240
But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.280
It's why we love stories about revenge.

12:30.280 --> 12:36.240
Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Old Boy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.640
Much too good for children.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.080
Revenge is such a popular plot line because it's easy for people to identify with a

12:45.080 --> 12:50.600
revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles

12:50.600 --> 12:51.680
of violence.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.960
This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey, by Homer.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
I stole this copy from my high school.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.960
And I stole this copy from my college.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.640
I still just read the Spark Notes.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
Well let's read it now.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.520
See I knew this would be useful someday.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.280
God he's such a fuckboy.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.840
What does Athena see in this man?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.240
He must be really hot.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.440
Okay, I'm ready for my book report.

13:13.440 --> 13:18.520
So the hero of the story is Odysseus, and the whole book is him trying to get home to

13:18.520 --> 13:25.960
the island of Ithaca after um, okay so in the prequel, Odysseus's shitty friend Menelaus

13:25.960 --> 13:30.840
throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually

13:30.840 --> 13:32.480
attracted to, how dare she.

13:32.480 --> 13:38.120
So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would

13:38.120 --> 13:41.120
do and blowing off some steam at Femboy's Symposium.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.520
Anyway when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is full of

13:45.520 --> 13:50.920
men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry his wife.

13:50.920 --> 13:55.960
So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors

13:55.960 --> 13:57.280
as payback.

13:57.280 --> 14:03.000
And then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors, and he has them

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
all hanged.

14:04.120 --> 14:09.560
And this one suitor, Melantheus, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose

14:09.560 --> 14:14.520
and feet, and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.960
In reading this I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?

14:19.960 --> 14:24.400
Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?

14:24.400 --> 14:28.080
I mean, super unlikable protagonist, really kinda kills it for me.

14:28.080 --> 14:32.080
I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable cause

14:32.320 --> 14:33.800
men love hearing about assholes.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.440
That's why they watch my channel.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.920
But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.

14:39.920 --> 14:46.400
The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his uh, his slaves.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.400
Yikes.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
Disappointing.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.400
Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.120
It isn't a good look.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.320
Wow this blew up, I don't have a soundcloud, give me money.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.600
Oh my god this contact is fully horizontal.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.920
This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.160
It just seems disproportionate you know, like it's not even eye for an eye, because the

15:06.160 --> 15:09.920
suitors didn't kill anyone, they were basically just rude to Odysseus.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.800
But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.880
They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it but

15:18.880 --> 15:19.880
whatever we'll play along.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.640
So that was an affront to Odysseus's honor.

15:22.640 --> 15:28.360
And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.840
Because this was a pre-legal society.

15:30.840 --> 15:36.200
No laws, no courts, no cops, school's out, fuck twelve.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.140
So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation, and that's what kept people from

15:41.140 --> 15:45.760
stealing and lying and murdering each other, though it was also often the thing causing

15:45.760 --> 15:49.560
them to murder each other, because back then honor was the only thing protecting people

15:49.560 --> 15:51.460
from being taken advantage of.

15:51.460 --> 15:55.700
If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themselves into your house and drinks

15:55.700 --> 16:00.340
your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that, because

16:00.340 --> 16:02.260
then people will walk all over you.

16:02.260 --> 16:06.940
So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person

16:06.940 --> 16:08.380
who is not to be messed with.

16:08.380 --> 16:12.100
It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.

16:12.100 --> 16:16.860
Hard masculinity is a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.

16:16.860 --> 16:20.260
It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.

16:20.260 --> 16:25.900
We call it toxic masculinity now because in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.260
We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.

16:29.260 --> 16:33.980
If society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.820
I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.

16:36.820 --> 16:41.540
Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Femboy Symposium.

16:41.540 --> 16:44.540
Extremely sad gay sounds, meow.

16:44.540 --> 16:48.980
But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not

16:48.980 --> 16:54.820
an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve

16:54.820 --> 17:01.140
conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.

17:01.140 --> 17:06.380
It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.

17:06.380 --> 17:10.300
And the poison is vengeance, justice served.

17:10.300 --> 17:14.740
So revenge is arguably the most basic form of retributive justice.

17:14.740 --> 17:19.940
The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first

17:19.940 --> 17:22.820
paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.

17:22.820 --> 17:23.820
Research!

17:23.820 --> 17:25.460
I am very smart, meow.

17:25.460 --> 17:30.780
But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.

17:30.780 --> 17:34.580
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?

17:34.580 --> 17:39.420
If someone harms you and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is going to try

17:39.420 --> 17:41.060
to get revenge by killing you.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.180
It's a cycle, a cycle of smashing.

17:44.180 --> 17:48.460
At the end of the Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together

17:48.460 --> 17:51.260
and plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.

17:51.260 --> 17:55.060
And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,

17:55.060 --> 18:01.620
who has an inexplicable ladyboner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him, by just making the

18:01.620 --> 18:04.700
families forget that Odysseus killed their children.

18:04.700 --> 18:10.340
So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence, but in reality, that

18:10.340 --> 18:14.980
doesn't happen very much, so these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.

18:14.980 --> 18:19.540
In Albania, there's an ancient code called the Canon, which requires a family to commit

18:19.540 --> 18:23.600
murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.640
Life for life, blood for blood.

18:25.640 --> 18:30.420
This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,

18:30.420 --> 18:33.780
and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of northern Albania.

18:33.780 --> 18:38.340
There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the

18:38.340 --> 18:42.420
rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them, and if they leave the house,

18:42.420 --> 18:43.780
they'll be murdered.

18:43.780 --> 18:48.660
Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed

18:48.660 --> 18:52.500
to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.380
These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange

18:56.380 --> 18:57.820
for getting to live as men.

18:57.820 --> 19:01.980
There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society, they're socially

19:01.980 --> 19:06.520
recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name, uwu, act as head

19:06.520 --> 19:10.800
of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges

19:10.800 --> 19:11.800
of a man.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.000
Extremely happy trans sounds, uwu.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.960
I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have

19:17.960 --> 19:22.720
been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to

19:22.720 --> 19:24.320
support trans rights.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.080
No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.680
Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to provide for their family

19:30.680 --> 19:31.680
because they were just too much for their feelings and their people.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.920
Yeah I know that, sweaty, it was just a joke, okay, calm down.

19:33.920 --> 19:39.520
Such cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
religions.

19:40.520 --> 19:44.840
I'm worried if I give a real example I'll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict

19:44.840 --> 19:51.160
where I'm supposed to take a side, so, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that

19:51.160 --> 19:57.040
the cat girls bomb the dog girls, and then the dog girls bomb the cat girls, and that

19:57.040 --> 20:01.960
cycle repeats for a few decades, and by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter

20:01.960 --> 20:07.320
list of grievances against each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.960
Extremely angry gay sounds, nyah.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.680
So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.240
It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.960
So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos

20:22.960 --> 20:27.680
caused by vengeance, and the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
system.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
2.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
Distribution.

20:30.720 --> 20:36.360
The extremely heckin' cute and valid German sociologist Max Weber defined the state as

20:36.360 --> 20:40.720
the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.

20:40.720 --> 20:45.720
In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long as they

20:45.720 --> 20:48.040
do so in accordance with the code of honor.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.320
But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.480
In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law

20:56.480 --> 21:03.680
codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as History Times.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.920
The code of Hammurabi looked like this.

21:05.920 --> 21:11.440
The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some primitive attempt at writing.

21:11.440 --> 21:16.160
I mean it was like a thousand years ago so I'm sure they were doing their best.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.000
It's very good sweetie, I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.560
Are they expecting this replica to be bigger?

21:22.560 --> 21:25.560
Sort of a spinal tap stonehenge situation?

21:26.160 --> 21:31.400
The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall and they were publicly placed in

21:31.400 --> 21:34.160
the city so that everyone knew what the laws were.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.880
Even though most people were illiterate, but hey, they tried sort of.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.480
Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.480
That's content right?

21:40.480 --> 21:43.480
Catgirl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.880
Niasqueen.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.560
We don't deserve rights.

21:48.560 --> 21:54.040
So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
is Y.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.360
222, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.000
That's extremely valid.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.200
If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother,

22:05.200 --> 22:09.000
you are not my father or my mother, his tongue shall be cut off.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.400
At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.640
If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.120
Now we're getting into some of the classics.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.640
If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.

22:21.640 --> 22:27.240
If a freedman strike the body of another freedman, he shall pay ten shekels in money.

22:27.240 --> 22:32.760
But if the slave of a freedman strike the body of a freedman, his ear shall be cut off.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.880
Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.280
So it's like our legal system except honest.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.520
If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house

22:42.520 --> 22:47.200
which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.720
If it killed the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
Love that.

22:52.720 --> 22:58.600
Okay, so by modern standards, the Code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.880
The vibrations are very negative.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.840
It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive, just a major vibe

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
killer all around.

23:04.840 --> 23:09.120
But you have to credit Hammurabi's Code for resolving the problem of honor-driven

23:09.120 --> 23:10.120
revenge cycles.

23:10.120 --> 23:14.360
You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against

23:14.360 --> 23:19.960
their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the

23:19.960 --> 23:24.600
elders of the city, who reach a verdict and impose a sentence just as served.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.840
So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante

23:28.840 --> 23:32.440
revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.360
Let's list all the differences.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.880
Revenge is personal, in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.720
It's often emotional, an act of passion.

23:40.720 --> 23:45.960
It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace,

23:45.960 --> 23:46.960
and it's sadistic.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.440
It's satisfying to the avenger.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.440
Revenge is sweet.

23:50.440 --> 23:55.120
On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal, in the sense that the

23:55.120 --> 23:59.120
punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.

23:59.120 --> 24:04.240
It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion, and also lacking the

24:04.240 --> 24:06.320
sadism of sweet revenge.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.360
It's also proportionate, again in theory.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.840
You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than

24:13.840 --> 24:18.840
an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's

24:18.840 --> 24:20.160
family for an eye.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.800
And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
the same crime.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.320
I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about

24:29.320 --> 24:30.640
it, just pay some gold.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.640
It's fine.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.000
Girl, these contacts, like.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.840
So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which

24:39.840 --> 24:45.240
is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.

24:45.240 --> 24:51.000
Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal while rejecting revenge as lawless.

24:51.000 --> 24:58.520
However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.

24:58.520 --> 25:03.040
It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.

25:03.080 --> 25:08.760
If revenge is wild justice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.720
In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out

25:13.720 --> 25:20.480
the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of way.

25:20.480 --> 25:25.760
Like in the Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the body

25:25.760 --> 25:30.200
part that you offended with, cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the

25:30.200 --> 25:34.480
breasts of the wet nurse who switched the babies, cutting out the tongue that renounced

25:34.480 --> 25:35.480
its parents.

25:35.480 --> 25:40.440
There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for this symmetry of

25:40.440 --> 25:41.920
punishment and crime.

25:41.920 --> 25:47.000
For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant karma.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.720
Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online, and then demands payment to take them down.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.680
The site's founders were just arrested for extortion.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
Here are their mugshots.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.200
There's something metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful

26:01.200 --> 26:02.200
cosmic harmony.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.040
And my guess is that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct

26:07.040 --> 26:09.160
that's difficult to get rid of.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.960
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it.

26:11.960 --> 26:18.080
The logic of retribution has been questioned for thousands of years, by philosophers, reformists,

26:18.080 --> 26:24.000
messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're too good to enjoy violence.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.320
One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the Love and Forgiveness School.

26:29.320 --> 26:34.280
And the main Love and Forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have heard of called Jesus

26:34.280 --> 26:35.640
of Nazareth.

26:35.640 --> 26:40.120
Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were similar to

26:40.120 --> 26:41.120
the Code of Hammurabi.

26:41.120 --> 26:46.400
Like in the Book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses, including some relaunches

26:46.400 --> 26:48.480
of Hammurabi classics.

26:48.480 --> 26:52.780
Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to Exodus 21-22.

26:52.780 --> 26:56.820
If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely, but

26:56.820 --> 27:01.540
there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands

27:01.540 --> 27:02.540
and the court allows.

27:02.540 --> 27:07.780
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for

27:07.780 --> 27:14.180
tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise,

27:14.180 --> 27:15.980
head pats for head pats.

27:15.980 --> 27:19.580
Welcome to Catholic Bible study, Neal.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.620
Extremely devotional gay sounds, you loo.

27:21.620 --> 27:23.700
I feel very spiritually aroused right now.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.180
My third eye chakra?

27:25.180 --> 27:26.180
Dripping.

27:26.180 --> 27:29.860
Macaroni in a pot.

27:29.860 --> 27:30.860
I need Jesus.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.860
I'm so sorry.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.140
So the law of Moses is pretty based and uncucked.

27:34.140 --> 27:40.620
It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.

27:40.620 --> 27:45.020
But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness.

27:45.020 --> 27:51.820
In Matthew 26, 52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays

27:51.820 --> 27:53.340
him, but Jesus says,

27:53.340 --> 27:56.100
Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.700
All who draw the sword will die by the sword.

27:58.700 --> 28:03.100
Some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced, even

28:03.100 --> 28:07.460
to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism.

28:07.460 --> 28:11.300
Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves?

28:11.300 --> 28:12.300
Rethink this.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.300
It gets worse.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.980
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says,

28:15.980 --> 28:19.500
Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.380
Love your enemies, but I don't want to love my enemies.

28:22.380 --> 28:23.380
No loving.

28:23.380 --> 28:24.380
Smashing.

28:24.380 --> 28:28.180
But maybe Jesus wasn't as literal-minded as that.

28:28.180 --> 28:33.460
You know, religion is a very subjective thing, and I have my own Bible interpretations,

28:33.460 --> 28:40.780
and my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.

28:40.780 --> 28:43.180
Like consider Matthew 5, 38.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.300
Why is no one talking about Matthew 5, 38?

28:45.300 --> 28:46.300
Jesus says,

28:46.300 --> 28:47.780
You have heard that it was said,

28:47.780 --> 28:49.940
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.660
But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer.

28:52.660 --> 28:56.740
But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.

28:56.740 --> 29:00.220
Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here.

29:00.220 --> 29:03.740
Someone strikes you across the face, and you go,

29:03.740 --> 29:04.740
Ugh.

29:04.740 --> 29:11.280
This is not pacifism, this is passive aggression, some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.

29:11.280 --> 29:18.280
This is the Christianity of, okay, well, I'll pray for you, but if you do take Jesus

29:18.280 --> 29:23.440
at face value, then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response

29:23.440 --> 29:29.600
to wrongdoing is not justice at all, it's an alternative to justice.

29:29.600 --> 29:36.040
In the absence of justice, forgiveness is an emotional unburdening of the resentment

29:36.040 --> 29:39.800
and anger that victims of injustice experience.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.680
And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about

29:44.680 --> 29:49.760
serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take care

29:49.760 --> 29:52.240
of that when the day of judgment comes.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.640
It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the idea of karma, which is like a

29:56.640 --> 30:03.800
cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human institution.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.760
You reap what you sow, basically.

30:05.760 --> 30:11.160
So maybe don't worry about injustice too much, because karma will take care of it.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.680
This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just-world fallacy, the cognitive bias

30:15.680 --> 30:19.080
that sees the world as inherently fair and good.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.720
Everything happens for a reason.

30:20.720 --> 30:25.080
If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say,

30:25.080 --> 30:29.600
There's a special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.680
And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being anally demolished

30:33.680 --> 30:35.460
by fire demons or whatever.

30:35.460 --> 30:42.100
People reassure themselves like this because it relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.300
In the Bible, the book of Job deals with the problem of injustice.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.620
Why do bad things happen to good people?

30:48.620 --> 30:51.180
And the answer is, just don't worry about it.

30:51.180 --> 30:54.140
It's part of God's plan, it'll all work out in the end.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.140
It's fine.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.140
Everything's fine.

30:56.140 --> 31:02.220
The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of very

31:02.220 --> 31:03.460
not good.

31:03.460 --> 31:09.620
In which case, you might start getting ideas in your head about, I don't know, maybe changing some things.

31:09.620 --> 31:14.500
I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not-all-religion, and obviously many political activists have

31:14.500 --> 31:18.580
been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.780
3. Utilitarianism

31:20.780 --> 31:27.300
So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking which tries to define justice as

31:27.300 --> 31:29.580
something other than retaliation.

31:29.620 --> 31:35.060
Utilitarian reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve

31:35.060 --> 31:38.620
society rather than punishment for punishment's sake.

31:38.620 --> 31:43.500
Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says that the right thing to do is whatever causes

31:43.500 --> 31:47.100
the highest ratio of human happiness to human suffering.

31:47.100 --> 31:52.140
So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future crimes,

31:52.140 --> 31:56.820
where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.

31:56.820 --> 32:01.620
Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence, punishing criminals as an incentive

32:01.620 --> 32:07.420
for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons, or rehabilitation

32:07.420 --> 32:11.660
of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society.

32:11.660 --> 32:16.220
A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than

32:16.220 --> 32:19.620
retribution, which is very based in emotions.

32:19.620 --> 32:25.020
Also the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense, even if you don't believe in free will.

32:25.020 --> 32:29.140
Because retribution really only makes sense if you believe that people freely choose their

32:29.140 --> 32:35.220
actions and are therefore culpable for their behavior, and can be deserving of punishment.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.900
Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems, well.

32:39.900 --> 32:44.740
The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the

32:44.740 --> 32:49.860
sea to be whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.620
Which seems irrational, right?

32:51.620 --> 32:53.100
To punish a force of nature?

32:53.220 --> 32:55.500
Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!

32:55.500 --> 33:01.220
It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially products of our genetics,

33:01.220 --> 33:06.980
our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house, the placement of Venus in our natal

33:06.980 --> 33:12.580
chart, dry-oilier combination, and modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that

33:12.580 --> 33:13.580
into consideration.

33:13.580 --> 33:17.540
Like, you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never

33:17.540 --> 33:22.220
took you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion, through no fault of my own I was

33:22.220 --> 33:25.620
high on bath salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor.

33:25.620 --> 33:30.340
A lot of the language around punishment in our legal system is utilitarian, like prisons

33:30.340 --> 33:35.140
are called correctional facilities, and not retribution cages.

33:35.140 --> 33:40.100
But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is, these facilities are

33:40.100 --> 33:41.540
not doing very much correcting.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.540
I'm sorry.

33:42.540 --> 33:47.740
In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,

33:47.740 --> 33:51.340
and 76% are re-arrested within five years.

33:51.460 --> 33:55.540
And just think about the way we talk about incarceration, like if someone really evil

33:55.540 --> 33:59.900
gets a long sentence, we say, good, I hope he rots in prison.

33:59.900 --> 34:04.060
Like when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said, good,

34:04.060 --> 34:08.980
the proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and release him

34:08.980 --> 34:11.260
a contributing member of his community.

34:11.260 --> 34:15.740
So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative

34:15.740 --> 34:19.900
function are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.

34:19.900 --> 34:25.700
I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational, it's often

34:25.700 --> 34:28.100
offensive to human emotions.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.500
And you can say facts don't care about your feelings, we shouldn't be basing our legal

34:31.500 --> 34:36.260
system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind, and I agree with you.

34:36.260 --> 34:41.300
But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him,

34:41.300 --> 34:42.820
you want to set him on fire.

34:42.820 --> 34:47.900
And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.300
A YouTuber called Jose has a video called

34:50.300 --> 34:52.660
Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,

34:52.660 --> 34:56.140
which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher

34:56.140 --> 34:58.460
because they relate to his military background

34:58.460 --> 35:01.500
while fantasizing about the moral simplicity

35:01.500 --> 35:02.940
of his vigilantism.

35:02.940 --> 35:05.980
Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans

35:05.980 --> 35:08.980
who say things like, Castle doesn't see shades of gray,

35:08.980 --> 35:12.020
which, unfortunately, the American justice system

35:12.020 --> 35:14.360
is littered with, and which tends to slow down

35:14.360 --> 35:16.780
and sometimes even hinder victims of crime

35:16.820 --> 35:18.820
from getting the justice they deserve.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.860
Frank Castle is the ultimate definition

35:20.860 --> 35:22.820
of Occam's razor for the military.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.060
Don't worry about uniforms, inspections,

35:25.060 --> 35:26.860
or restrictive rules of engagement.

35:26.860 --> 35:30.700
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys, protect the innocent.

35:30.700 --> 35:31.980
Any true warrior?

35:31.980 --> 35:33.140
That's the dream.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.620
So these cops and soldiers feel cramped

35:35.620 --> 35:38.820
by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions

35:38.820 --> 35:42.200
that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.420
You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier

35:45.420 --> 35:47.780
if it weren't for all these pesky laws.

35:47.780 --> 35:50.780
There's a childish simplicity and dualism

35:50.780 --> 35:52.340
to this moral worldview.

35:52.340 --> 35:55.140
Find the bad guys, kill the bad guys.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.500
Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric

35:57.500 --> 36:00.000
about how you need a good guy with a gun

36:00.000 --> 36:02.260
to stop a bad guy with a gun.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.580
They sound like eight-year-old boys

36:03.580 --> 36:05.340
playing cops and robbers.

36:05.340 --> 36:07.700
Good guys and bad guys.

36:07.700 --> 36:10.260
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.900
That's my impression of an eight-year-old boy.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.100
And to be fair, I totally understand

36:14.100 --> 36:15.700
the appeal of moral simplicity.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.220
People love justice-served

36:17.220 --> 36:19.700
and instant-karma videos for a reason.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.300
We take satisfaction in swift,

36:22.300 --> 36:24.820
decisive, elegant retribution.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.780
But the procedures of law enforcement

36:26.780 --> 36:29.300
and criminal justice don't allow for that.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.300
There's all these tedious roadblocks.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.860
Right to an attorney, right to remain silent,

36:33.860 --> 36:36.800
right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.280
A lot of police wish they could simplify things

36:39.280 --> 36:41.620
by being judge, jury, and executioner.

36:41.620 --> 36:44.140
But the function of police is supposed to be limited

36:44.140 --> 36:47.540
to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.540
They're not supposed to be walking avatars of karma

36:50.540 --> 36:52.500
dispensing free-form retribution

36:52.500 --> 36:54.980
in the streets at will, justice-served,

36:54.980 --> 36:57.380
now with 20% more police brutality.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.220
But a lot of people defend the police

36:59.220 --> 37:00.540
when they behave like this

37:00.540 --> 37:02.780
because the thin-wristed civilians

37:02.780 --> 37:04.940
are just as emotionally frustrated

37:04.940 --> 37:07.140
by due process as the cops.

37:07.140 --> 37:09.940
Well, did I just say all lives are bastards?

37:09.940 --> 37:11.100
I'm double-canceled.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.860
Well, look, all lives are bastards,

37:12.860 --> 37:15.100
but only some bastards are armed by the state

37:15.100 --> 37:17.580
and licensed to go bastarding around town.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.820
The rest of us have to be bastards on our off time.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.500
I also think there's a secular version

37:22.500 --> 37:24.820
of the just world fallacy going on here.

37:24.820 --> 37:27.820
People like to think that if the police kill somebody,

37:27.820 --> 37:30.700
it must be because that person did something wrong.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.900
Karma at work, justice served.

37:32.900 --> 37:36.800
Victim-blaming is an expression of the just world fallacy.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.180
You get what you deserve,

37:38.180 --> 37:40.860
so if something bad happens to you,

37:41.500 --> 37:42.460
you must've been asking for it.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.660
And obviously, racism is a huge part of this.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.820
You know, there's structural white supremacy

37:46.820 --> 37:49.060
that occupies black neighborhoods with police

37:49.060 --> 37:50.900
instead of investing in communities.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.700
And people are prejudiced and more likely

37:52.700 --> 37:54.780
to think of black people as criminal thugs

37:54.780 --> 37:56.980
and therefore deserving of police violence.

37:56.980 --> 37:58.980
So we get this no-angel discourse

37:58.980 --> 38:00.860
that comes up every time a black person

38:00.860 --> 38:02.160
is murdered by the police,

38:02.160 --> 38:04.300
where they bring up the victim's criminal record

38:04.300 --> 38:06.500
or a picture of them looking like a scary thug,

38:06.500 --> 38:08.980
as if that proves they deserved to die.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.620
The problem with this, of course,

38:11.380 --> 38:13.020
is that no one is an angel.

38:13.020 --> 38:15.460
There are no angels walking this earth.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.960
We're all flawed, we've all made mistakes,

38:17.960 --> 38:19.740
we've all done bad things that doesn't mean

38:19.740 --> 38:21.820
we deserve to die a violent death.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.660
And then there's people like Breonna Taylor

38:23.660 --> 38:25.820
and Elijah McClain, who as far as we know

38:25.820 --> 38:28.420
were about as close to angels as humans come,

38:28.420 --> 38:30.220
but that didn't protect them.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.400
So that is 100% beside the point,

38:32.400 --> 38:33.980
because black people in America

38:33.980 --> 38:36.460
should not literally have to have white feather wings

38:36.460 --> 38:38.220
and glowing halos to deserve

38:38.220 --> 38:39.900
not to be murdered by the police.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.500
In fact, people of all races have the absolute right

38:42.500 --> 38:44.860
to be low-life, drug-addicted, petty criminals

38:44.860 --> 38:47.020
who contribute absolutely nothing to society,

38:47.020 --> 38:49.740
and yet still not be executed by the cops,

38:49.740 --> 38:51.260
because that's what it's supposed to mean

38:51.260 --> 38:52.820
to live in a free country.

38:52.820 --> 38:54.540
So, things need to change.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.300
The Punisher police have got to go,

38:56.300 --> 38:58.540
and a lot of the rest of our justice system with them.

38:58.540 --> 39:01.180
We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice,

39:01.180 --> 39:02.980
and to be honest,

39:02.980 --> 39:05.060
that might take more than one YouTube video.

39:05.060 --> 39:06.020
I know at the beginning I said

39:06.020 --> 39:07.700
I was gonna explain what justice is,

39:07.700 --> 39:11.540
but I lied.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.260
I'm sorry that I can't fix America.

39:15.260 --> 39:16.620
I'm just a lonely cat.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.980
I guess the only solution is revolution,

39:19.980 --> 39:21.940
and by revolution, I do mean vote Democrat

39:21.940 --> 39:24.780
and then bully the Democrats into actually doing something,

39:24.780 --> 39:28.860
and if they don't listen, well...

39:28.860 --> 39:32.340
Hang on, let me get this.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.940
Moshi moshi.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.420
Hey, how are you days?

40:32.380 --> 40:34.980
I'm still here.

40:34.980 --> 40:37.420

40:37.420 --> 40:39.260

40:39.260 --> 40:41.380

Hang on, let me get this.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.100

41:27.180 --> 41:29.420

41:29.420 --> 41:31.740
