1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:20,000
messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,800
were influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and lo,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
a vision.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Freedom, freedom, fuckin' freedom.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Which matters more?

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,800
The freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
of a jackboot?

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
As a centrist, I am undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,800
important issues, like Mexicans, how dangerous are they?

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Muslims, can we stop them?

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,800
into all manner of half-and-halves and in-betweens.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,800
I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
It makes me want to throw up.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Cut the music!

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
opinion haver.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
And my second guest...

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, what the hell are you?

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
your deal?

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal is I don't like society forcing me into tiny

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
little boxes.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay, but are you a man or a woman?

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Just tell me.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, why does it matter?

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Why do you have to know?

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
little categories, Jackie Jackson.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
My name is Baltimore.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Baltimore what?

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Baltimore, Maryland.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
It is among my names.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Tiffany, what do you make of this?

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I am a transsexual.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
It is not a fashion statement.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
It is not a trend.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
It is not an easy way to feel special and depressed.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
It is a very difficult condition to live with.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm dying inside.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
No, I am a transsexual.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
That is not a transsexual.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
That is a trans-trender.

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Trans-trender?

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
What is that?

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Is that a gender?

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
No, it's not a gender.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,800
A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here who puts on a dress and puts glitter in his beard

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,800
and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Actually, it's they.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
What?

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I use they, them pronouns.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Have I complained about oppression so far?

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,800
It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
It's in my brain.

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I was diagnosed.

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
It's a fact.

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
It's real.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
My pain is real.

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
And my pain isn't real?

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It's interesting that you think that.

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Well, what pain are you talking about?

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Interesting that you mention the circus, Tiffany Tumbles.

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
You're not confined anywhere.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
You choose to dress like that.

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Hello.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Well, it's a free country.

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,800
If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?

95
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?

96
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,800
That is simply adding another cell to the prison.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's not about conforming.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
It's about me having an actual medical condition.

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You do not have a female brain.

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You have a fashion disaster.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Oh, do they?

103
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
when the doctor prescribed your hormones,

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
did he take a look at your brain then?

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
What? Of course not.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, no. Where are you going with this?

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I mean, if you've never seen your brain

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,800
how do you know that you have a female brain?

113
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Bullshit.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
That's a good point.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
No, it isn't.

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Look, there's scientific studies that...

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Are they different colors?

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm not an expert,

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

121
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I see.

122
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
But your doctor never looked at your brain.

123
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.

125
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
And you told him what, exactly?

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
That I experience gender dysphoria.

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

128
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and therefore your identity,

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,800
is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain,

130
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
but because of your...

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
...feelings?

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You backed me into a corner.

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Sure, it's because of my feelings.

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
My feelings of gender dysphoria.

136
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,800
So, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,800
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,

138
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
but mine, according to you, are not?

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
This burgeoning brick.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
You guys, let's think about this.

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
If I've never seen my brain,

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
how do I know I even have a brain?

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Well, you probably don't, girl.

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
And if you feel cloud gender or deminebula or astroglide

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,800
or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
then you do you, girl.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
But I want to make one thing very clear.

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I am nothing like you, okay?

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
My gender is not unicorns and glitter.

152
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis

153
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

154
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
No, not even you.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?

156
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
No, well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.

157
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
when, in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Your pain?

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

163
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I pity you because you don't think you're real

165
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
And I can't imagine what it must be like

167
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
to have so little confidence in your own reality.

168
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Okay, well, don't patronize me.

169
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,800
why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating your body.

171
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,

173
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
but you do have to have dysphoria.

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.

175
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.

176
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Would you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness?

177
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Actually, I would strongly prefer if you would stay away from any of my rifts.

178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect Tiffany

179
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
against the ravages of inner strife.

180
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Enclose her in your loving arms

181
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
and cleanse her of all condemnation and internalized transphobia.

182
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I entreat you, oh great mother,

183
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care

184
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
and rid her of her toxic, cis-normative, true-scum ways.

185
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Amen.

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Are we done here?

187
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver unto you?

189
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Because I'm grossed out by you. That's why.

190
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Okay, then.

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Well, namaste, bitch.

192
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Look, why don't we all take a step back

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
and let them know how much we appreciate their service.

195
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
God, I love the troops.

196
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Thinking about the troops makes me wet.

197
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It makes me cum.

198
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Semper fi, boys.

199
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
What?

200
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

201
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Tiffany, your transsexualism,

202
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I have to say I don't love it,

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
but you do seem to at least be aware that you have some kind of mental disorder,

204
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
so I'll give you that.

205
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Making some kind of statement?

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
If my existence is a statement,

208
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I think that says more about society than it says about me.

209
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Jackie, what you have to understand

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I've talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,

212
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
and they agree with me that all this genderqueer bullshit,

213
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
it's just a trend.

214
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
It's a fad.

215
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
But is it?

216
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
For thousands of years,

217
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
there have been third gender groups across human cultures.

218
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
There's the Hidra of India,

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
the two-spirit people among Native Americans.

220
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Whereas, binary transsexualism is a medical construct of the 20th century.

221
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until 2013,

222
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,800
meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.

223
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,

224
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
and not I who is following a trend.

225
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Wow, that just blew my mind.

226
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
The tables are turned, bitch.

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a trans-trender?

228
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
He's not Native American, though.

229
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
They.

230
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
They.

231
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he when you have a fucking beard.

232
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,

233
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.

234
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Your Honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.

235
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Okay.

236
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they.

237
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
But what it isn't is two-spirit.

238
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.

239
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
They think it's racist.

240
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
White people have two genders.

241
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Pick one and sit down, dude.

242
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Yeah, that's a good point.

243
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Two genders.

244
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Two genders.

245
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Attack helicopter.

246
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Attack helicopter.

247
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Two genders, only two genders.

248
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
How many genders?

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Two.

250
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Attack helicopter.

251
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Attack helicopter.

252
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Two genders.

253
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Two genders.

254
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,800
You're just saying that you're me and talking in a whiny voice.

255
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
That is not an argument.

256
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,800
You know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal with in life is assholes.

257
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it.

258
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Let's be ourselves.

259
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Let's totally be ourselves.

260
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
All right, that's enough of this.

261
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,800
You know, as a biological female, I honestly don't understand any of this tranny shit.

262
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay, that was a hard T.

263
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house and ask me to call him Mommy's Little Slut?

264
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Well, sure, but that is a matter between her and the Lord.

265
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Let's best not think about it too much.

266
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Anyway, Tiffany, my brain has an easier time processing you than whatever is going on over here.

267
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
So, congratulations, you're the winner.

268
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
That was some excellent free speech.

269
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Okay.

270
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Great.

271
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
So, in conclusion, trans-trenders are real and probably dangerous.

272
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Make sure to protect your children.

273
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,800
As for how many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.

274
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
All right, that's our show.

275
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
This has been the Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.

276
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Except when the show is over.

277
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Get out!

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
The girl can't help it.

279
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
She's a Libra.

280
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Behold, the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected.

281
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,800
They gave their cheek to them that mocked their beard and hid not their face from shame.

282
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,800
But lo, Tiffany, the persecutrix, trendier than thou, a shady queen,

283
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,800
came next upon her friend Justine and sought her counsel thus.

284
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Goddammit, Justine.

285
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I just can't with these trenders anymore.

286
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I simply cannot.

287
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door.

288
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Okay.

289
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Seems a little formal.

290
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Ugh.

291
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
You look great, hon.

292
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Cute.

293
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Justine, you look like absolute shit.

294
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
What happened?

295
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Did the cat girl finally beat you up?

296
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
No, I just—look, I slept in my makeup, okay?

297
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Leave me alone.

298
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I've been having a difficult time.

299
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Are we serving a little depression moment?

300
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Jesus.

301
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, don't leave me out.

302
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
I saw you on the Freedom Report today.

303
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Okay, girl, can we talk about ladybeard Baltimore, Maryland?

304
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Ugh, add that one to the crazy tranny hall of fame.

305
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Really?

306
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
You're happy with the way that went?

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
You feel good about that?

308
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
You feel good about yourself right now?

309
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Well, why wouldn't I?

310
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world

311
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
than a tran who thinks she's better than other trans.

312
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.

313
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
You seem to think that you're queen of the world

314
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,800
because you're hanging on to societal acceptance by two fingers instead of one.

315
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Well, you're not, bitch.

316
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
You're just an insecure, frightened little queer

317
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,800
who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread other people down.

318
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.

319
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Your eyelash is coming unglued.

320
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
My life is coming unglued.

321
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Ugh.

322
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Look, it's not like I'm coming after trannies who just can't afford to transition

323
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
or don't have the social support.

324
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he can to pass

325
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,800
and people just treat him like a freak for no reason.

326
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
They. It's they.

327
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Are we really saying they now?

328
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
In private?

329
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Yes, we are. So get used to it.

330
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
My name is Justine.

331
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I think misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings.

332
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Ugh.

333
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I always forget that you're, like, actually an SJW.

334
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I always forget that you're actually an asshole.

335
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Why do I even hang out with you?

336
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Oh, because you hate yourself?

337
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
And you have to believe there's hope for me?

338
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Because if there's hope for me, there might be hope for you?

339
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Wow, you're developing self-consciousness.

340
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Where'd you learn that trick?

341
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Gigi?

342
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Tiffany.

343
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Have you ever been bullied?

344
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, let's see. Let me think.

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day.

346
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the victim.

347
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully.

348
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I think you grew up getting bullied for being a sissy

349
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
till you started passing as a woman.

350
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
And then you got a little taste of normal,

351
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
and now you want to be the one who bashes the queers.

352
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Bash them?

353
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
If anything, I'm the one defending trans people

354
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders.

355
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
You said on air that Baltimore grosses you out.

356
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here

357
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
have nothing to do with your own self-loathing?

358
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is nothing like me?

359
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse.

360
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Oh, it's not bigotry.

361
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Look, I shouldn't have said grossed out, I'll give you that,

362
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,800
but he does, they do make me uncomfortable.

363
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
And why do you think that is?

364
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Ugh, I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.

365
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Ugh, it makes me want to down a bottle of hormones.

366
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Make sure I never look like that.

367
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Bitch, secondhand dysphoria, what is that?

368
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
You know when you look at a tranny and you just clock everything

369
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,800
and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria?

370
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah, I do know what you're talking about,

371
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
and I'll tell you why it happens.

372
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
When you're early in your transition and you're doing everything you can to pass,

373
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,800
you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little thing that makes you clockable.

374
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people

375
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
and you project your dysphoria onto them.

376
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I buy that.

377
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Yeah, well that is absolutely not a valid reason

378
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
to police other trans people's presentation.

379
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Secondhand dysphoria is not valid.

380
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
The fact that you project your dysphoria onto other people

381
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
is your problem and your problem alone.

382
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
And you need to deal with that issue in private, girl,

383
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
not on a fucking talk show.

384
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

385
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,800
But it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid.

386
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Tiffany, let's be pragmatic about this.

387
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Suppose everything you're saying is true.

388
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Suppose the only real trans people are dysphoric, binary transgender people.

389
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Transsexuals.

390
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Every time you say the word transsexual, I feel like it's 1978.

391
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Are you 80 years old?

392
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I guess you could say I'm not the trendiest person.

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Haha.

394
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Look, suppose you're right,

395
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
and everyone who doesn't meet your definition of a transsexual

396
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
is some kind of confused trend follower.

397
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Even if that were true, and to be clear, it isn't,

398
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid,

399
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
because virtually every trans person

400
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
goes through a period of being confused about their gender

401
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
and of having nonconforming expression,

402
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
and you're going around enforcing a stigma against that.

403
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Didn't you ever have doubts about your gender?

404
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Weren't you ever androgynous?

405
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Oh, yeah, I mean, I was never that burgeoning,

406
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
but I had my little cringe year being a nonbinary SJW.

407
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Uh-huh.

408
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
And one of the great things about nonbinary identities

409
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist

410
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
even when neither gender really fits them,

411
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple months.

412
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated

413
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
for being a trender during your exploration year

414
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
might not have been the most helpful thing?

415
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Not really.

416
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
I have dysphoria, so if anyone called me a trender,

417
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'd eventually prove them wrong.

418
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
That's all I'm saying.

419
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
If you're not a trender, then transition.

420
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Prove me wrong.

421
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
But the stigma you perpetuate

422
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
against gender confusion and experimentation

423
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition.

424
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
It alienates baby trans from the community

425
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
that should be welcoming them

426
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
instead of publicly humiliating them.

427
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
And when you appoint yourself the public decider

428
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
of whomst is really trans,

429
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
the Torquemada of the trender inquisition,

430
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
you're terrorizing a lot of people

431
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.

432
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Okay.

433
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
But then how do we decide which tr**neys are valid?

434
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
We don't.

435
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
This is where I'm losing you,

436
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
because trans trenders are absolutely a thing.

437
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Like, undeniably.

438
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I've talked to people who've literally told me

439
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
they used to be trans trenders.

440
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
So some people question their gender

441
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
but end up deciding they're not really trans.

442
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
There is nothing wrong with that,

443
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
and those people still aren't being helped

444
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
by public shaming.

445
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place

446
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
if SJWs weren't going around telling people

447
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
they don't need dysphoria to be trans.

448
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
You know, it's one thing if teenage girls

449
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
want to dye their hair pink and call themselves

450
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
demi-boys for most of sophomore year,

451
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
but some of these kids are actually

452
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
going to medically transition.

453
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
And soon, we're going to have an epidemic

454
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
of detransitioners on our hands.

455
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
And there's going to be TERFs publishing

456
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I-Told-You-So op-eds in every major newspaper.

457
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Now, maybe you think that's worth it,

458
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
just to make sure no one ever feels

459
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
invalidated for any reason.

460
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
But I think that's highly irresponsible.

461
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Look, if you're so worried about people

462
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
feeling pressured to medically transition,

463
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
then what you should be doing is

464
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
working to make the trans community

465
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
as inclusive and welcoming as possible

466
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
to gender non-conforming people

467
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
and non-binary people, and people who are

468
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
questioning, and trans people who don't

469
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
medically transition. But instead,

470
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
you're doing the exact opposite.

471
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
You're telling everyone that medical transition

472
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
is the only way to be valid,

473
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
and if anything is pressuring people to medically transition,

474
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
it's that.

475
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Justine, I think you're a good person.

476
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Maybe too good.

477
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
And that's why you're trying to have compassion

478
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
for everyone, but at some point,

479
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
you have to protect yourself.

480
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
We live in a world of Jackie Jacksons

481
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
who don't understand trans people

482
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
and don't think we're real. So we need

483
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
to have an explanation of what it is to be trans

484
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
that's based on facts and not

485
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
feelings. And the most factual

486
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
explanation is transmedicalism,

487
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
which is the idea that transsexualism

488
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
is a diagnosable mental disorder

489
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
called gender dysphoria.

490
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
There's science to back this up, it's accepted

491
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
by medical professionals, and it clearly

492
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
explains why we are valid,

493
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
unlike Rachel Dolezal,

494
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
and snowflake gender teenagers,

495
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
and people who identify as cats.

496
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Okay, I see the appeal,

497
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
but I don't think transmedicalism

498
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
is as validating as you think it is.

499
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Why not? I'll put it bluntly.

500
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Why does having gender dysphoria

501
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
make you a woman? Because gender dysphoria

502
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
means I have a female brain.

503
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
No it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you,

504
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
but the science does not say what you think

505
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
it says. There may be neurological

506
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
causes of gender dysphoria,

507
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
but at the end of the day, all dysphoria

508
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
is is discomfort in a male body,

509
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
or a male social role, or however you want

510
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
to put it. And wanting to

511
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
be a woman is not the same

512
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
thing as being a

513
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
woman. Not by any means.

514
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Girl, where are you going with this?

515
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
What is this? Are you becoming a TERF?

516
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
No, I just don't think your theory actually validates

517
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
our womanhood. Well, if you're right,

518
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
that's a real problem. Because

519
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
we need to have reason, and science,

520
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
and logic, and facts on our side

521
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
so that we can explain to society

522
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
that we are valid, and that we are real,

523
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
otherwise,

524
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
bad things. Well, maybe

525
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
there's a better theory. Well, okay,

526
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Socrates, let's hear it then.

527
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
The way I see it, gender is either

528
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
psychological, or biological,

529
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
or social. Now my friend

530
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Tabby, the cat girl, she

531
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
thinks it's all psychological, that it's

532
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
just identity, that whatever you

533
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
think about your own gender is true.

534
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
And that makes me really uncomfortable.

535
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Because then, what's the

536
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
difference between identifying as a woman,

537
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
and identifying as a Norwegian forest

538
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself

539
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
seems not to have much of a

540
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to

541
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
tell you about transtrenders this entire time.

542
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Just let me finish. If gender is strictly

543
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
biological, then that's game over

544
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
for trans people, unless you make some kind

545
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
of wrong brain and the wrong body argument,

546
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
but I told you I'm not buying that.

547
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
So that leaves gender as a social

548
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
construct. Are you going to try to make me read Judith

549
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Butler again? I'll summarize it.

550
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Gender is a series of gestures.

551
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
It's called performativity.

552
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak.

553
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
It's the way you act. It's the way you

554
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
relate to other people. Through

555
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
transitioning, we habituate to the

556
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
gestures of womanhood, and socially

557
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
that makes us women. Regardless

558
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
of biology or psychology, checkmate

559
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,800
transphobes.

560
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Okay.

561
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
The problem with that is that it's both

562
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
too exclusionary and too

563
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
inclusive. It excludes a lot of

564
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
trans people who can't transition for

565
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
circumstantial reasons, but whose dysphoria

566
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
is very real. And it includes

567
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
every trans-trender,

568
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
drag queen, fetishist, and two-bit

569
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
cross-dressing comedian in a dine-out

570
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
wig. Uh. Well.

571
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Do you really believe that a man who plays a woman

572
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
on stage becomes just as much of a

573
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
woman as you and me?

574
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Yes?

575
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Bitch, no you don't! Yeah, you're right.

576
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm full of shit. I know

577
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
you are. Because you're an SJW.

578
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
And SJWs hate performativity

579
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
theory almost as much as they hate me.

580
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Well, they only hate it because they don't understand it.

581
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
They think it invalidates non-binary identities,

582
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
but in fact it's the most rational way

583
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
to explain non-binary identities.

584
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
How can you perform a non-binary

585
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
identity? Simple. You learn the rules

586
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
so you can break them. Wearing a

587
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
beard and a dress communicates ambiguity.

588
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Even the gesture of declaring

589
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
I am neither a man or a woman

590
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
is a speech act that removes

591
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
the speaker from the semantics-

592
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Shut up. This is too much philosophizing.

593
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I can't stand it anymore. Why don't you

594
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
tell me what's really going on with you?

595
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Why do you look like you've been in a K-hole for a week?

596
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with

597
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
white knighting for non-binary people?

598
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Because I am non-binary.

599
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
No you're not!

600
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
What are you talking about?

601
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
I just feel like

602
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
since I started transitioning I've been trying

603
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
so hard to fit in and

604
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
to perform my gender and to pass

605
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
and to just be normal.

606
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
But I can't do it anymore.

607
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
I just cannot make it work.

608
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I feel like an actor. I feel like

609
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions

610
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
of this new gender role that's supposed

611
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
to liberate me, but that's somehow

612
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
just as empty as the old one.

613
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Because I'm just not normal, Tiffany.

614
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm a freak. And I'm always gonna be

615
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
a freak. Justine, you're not

616
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
non-binary. You're gay.

617
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
And everyone can see this except you.

618
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Oh come on. I'm not...

619
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm not gay.

620
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Justine

621
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
was extremely gay.

622
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Protest though the lady may,

623
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
there simply is no stopping gayness.

624
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I love

625
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
cat girls!

626
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
I hate

627
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
cat girls, but I also love them!

628
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh

629
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
abominable fate.

630
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Okay. So I'm a little bit

631
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
gay. Right. And you don't know how to reconcile

632
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
your attraction to women with your desire

633
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
to perform your gender. That's why you

634
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
feel this dissonance. Yeah.

635
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I guess that's basically it.

636
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Well it really shouldn't be that hard, girl.

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
You already came out as a woman, just blurt it out.

638
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Say, hello world,

639
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
my name is Justine

640
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
and I fuck pussy.

641
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
That's a very cis-normative way to say it.

642
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Hello world,

643
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
my name is Justine and

644
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I fuck pussy?

645
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Ugh. I feel like a man

646
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
when I say it. Yeah, well you should probably

647
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
buy a pickup truck then.

648
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Get some of those mud flaps on the back

649
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
with the little sexy ladies on them and

650
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
you may as well change your name back to

651
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Justine. Okay, well that's

652
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
just uncalled for. Girl, I don't know what to

653
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
say except I told you so. Sexuality

654
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
is just like gender identity.

655
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
It is not a performance, it's not a

656
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
trend, it's not a choice, it's

657
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
just part of who you are and there's

658
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
nothing you can do to change it.

659
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
I guess

660
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
you're right. I guess my theory sucks.

661
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
It sucks so fucking hard,

662
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
but the good news is you can

663
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
unclench your asshole now and do whatever you

664
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
want because you're still a woman whether you're

665
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
performing a stereotype or not.

666
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
So run free, Justine.

667
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Go top a cis woman.

668
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized

669
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
flannel. Do whatever you want.

670
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Wow, yeah, I guess

671
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
that is pretty liberating. Yeah,

672
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
thank god for transmedicalism, right?

673
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, except not

674
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
because you just destroyed transmedicalism

675
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
with facts and logic, so we have no

676
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
theory. We have no theory, Justine.

677
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
What do we do now? How do we prove

678
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
we're valid? Well, just do what every trans

679
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
woman has done since the beginning of time.

680
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Go out and fuck the most brutally

681
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
heterosexual man you can find and

682
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
be validated and come.

683
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Oh, honey, I have and I will,

684
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
but that's not gonna convince anyone but

685
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
me. It's not a proof.

686
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
It's not a theory. Well, maybe

687
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
we don't need a theory. Maybe we

688
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
don't need to prove anything.

689
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Bad things, Justine. Bad things.

690
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Well, do we have a theory about why

691
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
people are gay? No. They just

692
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
are. The only reason we even feel

693
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
like we need a theory about trans people

694
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
is that society is so unaccepting

695
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
of us that it's constantly demanding

696
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
we justify our own reality.

697
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay, so what am I supposed to tell Jackie

698
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Jackson, then? What am I supposed to tell

699
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
the TERFs? That I'm a woman because

700
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
reasons? No. Not

701
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
even because reasons. Just

702
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
because you are. So it's what? A leap

703
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
of faith? Oh, great.

704
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm sure that's gonna convince all the rational

705
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800
skeptics. Justine,

706
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
it makes us sound completely delusional.

707
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Well, Tiffany, delusion

708
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
is what separates us from the

709
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
animals. Who do you think built the pyramids

710
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
and the cathedrals? Clearly not people

711
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
with a perfectly rational worldview.

712
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one who thinks

713
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't

714
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
describe it as the height of sanity,

715
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
but I would prefer to think that my whole

716
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
life and identity is based on something I

717
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
can rationally explain. Well, what are

718
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the

719
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
single most obnoxious thing about men

720
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
that they think they have to wrap up the entire

721
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
world in a little rational box?

722
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Maybe the most important

723
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
things in life can't be logically

724
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
proved. Can you logically prove

725
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
that you love your own children?

726
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
No. And the attempt to prove

727
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
it is as degrading as it is

728
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
futile. Maybe gender identity

729
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
is one of those things.

730
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Okay, but then how do I

731
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
prove I'm more valid than Baltimore,

732
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Maryland, and the star genders,

733
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
and the cat people? Well, maybe

734
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
we should stop getting so caught up

735
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
in proving our validity to ourselves

736
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
that we end up being horribly cruel

737
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
to other people. What if we just accept

738
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
all the freaks of the world?

739
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as

740
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
important to have logical proofs as it

741
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
is to be empathetic and open-minded

742
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
and compassionate.

743
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Kumbaya,

744
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
my lord,

745
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
kumbaya.

746
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Kumbaya, my lord,

747
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
kumbaya.

748
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Kumbaya, my lord,

749
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
kumbaya.

750
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Kumbaya.

751
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I have something to tell you.

752
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Here it comes.

753
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
I love you.

754
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Okay.

755
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Well, I'm going to get going now.

756
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
I have an important

757
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries

758
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
and reading YouTube comments by myself,

759
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
so I'd really

760
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
better go do that, but

761
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
good luck with your new

762
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
life as a male lesbian who fucks cats.

763
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Ugh.

764
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Oh, are you upset?

765
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Just go.

766
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm sorry.

767
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Ugh. I hate

768
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
this bitch.

769
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
But god, she's a yum-yum.

770
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Harken, children.

771
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
In this vision you have witnessed

772
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
mortal fools upon the screen.

773
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Fools who do not love

774
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
themselves. But I,

775
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
your goddess, mother, queen,

776
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
messiah, I am

777
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
nothing like them.

778
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
For I am truth.

779
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I am light.

780
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I am in capitalism.

781
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
And everything I tweet is

782
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
woke. But most importantly,

783
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I am not a

784
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
woke. But most importantly,

785
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I love myself.

786
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I love myself so much it makes me wet.

787
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
It makes me cum.

788
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.

790
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800

Amen.

792

Amen.
