0	12600	Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital
12600	20000	messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there
20000	25800	were influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and lo,
25800	31800	I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them
31800	32800	a vision.
42800	45800	Freedom, freedom, fuckin' freedom.
45800	47800	Which matters more?
47800	51800	The freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel
51800	52800	of a jackboot?
52800	58800	As a centrist, I am undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.
58800	63800	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss
63800	67800	important issues, like Mexicans, how dangerous are they?
67800	69800	Muslims, can we stop them?
69800	74800	Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children
74800	77800	into all manner of half-and-halves and in-betweens.
77800	83800	I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?
83800	85800	It makes me want to throw up.
85800	90800	I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.
90800	91800	Cut the music!
91800	96800	Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative
96800	97800	opinion haver.
97800	99800	And my second guest...
99800	100800	Well, what the hell are you?
100800	105800	You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's
105800	106800	your deal?
106800	114800	Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal is I don't like society forcing me into tiny
114800	115800	little boxes.
115800	117800	Okay, but are you a man or a woman?
117800	118800	Just tell me.
118800	120800	Well, why does it matter?
120800	122800	Why do you have to know?
122800	127800	Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these
127800	130800	little categories, Jackie Jackson.
131800	136800	Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?
136800	138800	My name is Baltimore.
138800	140800	Baltimore what?
140800	142800	Baltimore, Maryland.
142800	145800	I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?
145800	148800	It is among my names.
148800	150800	Tiffany, what do you make of this?
150800	153800	Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.
153800	155800	I am a transsexual.
155800	159800	That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.
159800	163800	I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.
163800	168800	This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones
168800	171800	and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.
171800	173800	It is not a fashion statement.
173800	174800	It is not a trend.
174800	177800	It is not an easy way to feel special and depressed.
177800	179800	It is a very difficult condition to live with.
183800	184800	I'm dying inside.
184800	187800	Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.
187800	189800	No, I am a transsexual.
189800	191800	That is not a transsexual.
191800	193800	That is a trans-trender.
193800	194800	Trans-trender?
194800	195800	What is that?
195800	196800	Is that a gender?
196800	197800	No, it's not a gender.
197800	203800	A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here who puts on a dress and puts glitter in his beard
203800	209800	and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.
209800	211800	Actually, it's they.
211800	212800	What?
212800	214800	I use they, them pronouns.
214800	217800	They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.
217800	220800	Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?
220800	223800	Have I complained about oppression so far?
223800	229800	It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.
229800	234800	Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?
234800	237800	No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.
237800	240800	I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.
240800	242800	It's in my brain.
242800	243800	I was diagnosed.
243800	244800	It's a fact.
244800	245800	It's real.
245800	247800	My pain is real.
247800	249800	And my pain isn't real?
249800	252800	It's interesting that you think that.
252800	254800	Well, what pain are you talking about?
254800	257800	People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?
257800	261800	Interesting that you mention the circus, Tiffany Tumbles.
261800	267800	Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?
267800	269800	You're not confined anywhere.
269800	271800	You choose to dress like that.
271800	274800	And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?
274800	277800	Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.
277800	278800	Hello.
278800	282800	And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.
282800	288800	Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?
288800	289800	Well, it's a free country.
289800	293800	If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.
293800	296800	But don't go around telling people that you're transgender
296800	299800	because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.
299800	303800	But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?
303800	307800	Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?
307800	311800	Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.
311800	315800	That is simply adding another cell to the prison.
315800	317800	It's not about conforming.
317800	320800	It's about me having an actual medical condition.
320800	322800	You do not have a female brain.
322800	324800	You have a fashion disaster.
324800	326800	Oh, do they?
326800	329800	Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
329800	331800	when the doctor prescribed your hormones,
331800	334800	did he take a look at your brain then?
334800	336800	What? Of course not.
336800	340800	But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?
340800	343800	Well, no. Where are you going with this?
343800	346800	I mean, if you've never seen your brain
346800	350800	and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,
350800	353800	then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
353800	357800	how do you know that you have a female brain?
361800	362800	Bullshit.
362800	363800	That's a good point.
363800	364800	No, it isn't.
364800	366800	Look, there's scientific studies that...
366800	371800	Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?
371800	374800	Are they different colors?
374800	375800	I'm not an expert,
375800	378800	but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.
378800	379800	I see.
379800	382800	But your doctor never looked at your brain.
382800	386800	So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?
386800	389800	Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.
389800	392800	And you told him what, exactly?
392800	395800	That I experience gender dysphoria.
395800	398800	So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,
398800	400800	and therefore your identity,
400800	405800	is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain,
405800	408800	but because of your...
408800	412800	...feelings?
412800	414800	Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.
414800	416800	You backed me into a corner.
416800	418800	Sure, it's because of my feelings.
418800	420800	My feelings of gender dysphoria.
420800	423800	So, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
423800	428800	why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,
428800	432800	but mine, according to you, are not?
432800	435800	This burgeoning brick.
435800	437800	You guys, let's think about this.
437800	440800	If I've never seen my brain,
440800	443800	how do I know I even have a brain?
443800	445800	Well, you probably don't, girl.
445800	449800	Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.
449800	453800	And if you feel cloud gender or deminebula or astroglide
453800	456800	or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,
456800	458800	then you do you, girl.
458800	461800	Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.
461800	463800	But I want to make one thing very clear.
464800	468800	I am nothing like you, okay?
468800	470800	My gender is not unicorns and glitter.
470800	473800	My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis
473800	475800	that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
475800	477800	No, not even you.
477800	481800	My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?
481800	485800	No, well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.
485800	488800	You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria
488800	491800	that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community
491800	494800	when, in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.
494800	496800	Your pain?
496800	500800	You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?
500800	505800	Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.
505800	507800	And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.
507800	510800	I pity you because you don't think you're real
510800	514800	until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.
514800	517800	And I can't imagine what it must be like
518800	522800	to have so little confidence in your own reality.
522800	524800	Okay, well, don't patronize me.
524800	527800	I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,
527800	532800	why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating your body.
532800	536800	Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?
536800	539800	No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,
539800	541800	but you do have to have dysphoria.
541800	544800	And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.
544800	548800	I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.
548800	553800	Would you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness?
553800	557800	Actually, I would strongly prefer if you would stay away from any of my rifts.
557800	560800	Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect Tiffany
560800	563800	against the ravages of inner strife.
563800	565800	Enclose her in your loving arms
565800	570800	and cleanse her of all condemnation and internalized transphobia.
570800	572800	I entreat you, oh great mother,
572800	575800	bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care
575800	579800	and rid her of her toxic, cis-normative, true-scum ways.
579800	580800	Amen.
580800	581800	Are we done here?
581800	585800	I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.
585800	589800	Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver unto you?
589800	591800	Because I'm grossed out by you. That's why.
591800	592800	Okay, then.
592800	594800	Well, namaste, bitch.
594800	598800	Look, why don't we all take a step back
598800	602800	and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform
602800	605800	and let them know how much we appreciate their service.
605800	607800	God, I love the troops.
607800	609800	Thinking about the troops makes me wet.
609800	611800	It makes me cum.
611800	613800	Semper fi, boys.
617800	618800	What?
618800	620800	I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.
620800	623800	Tiffany, your transsexualism,
623800	625800	I have to say I don't love it,
625800	629800	but you do seem to at least be aware that you have some kind of mental disorder,
629800	630800	so I'll give you that.
630800	634800	Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?
634800	635800	Making some kind of statement?
635800	637800	If my existence is a statement,
637800	641800	I think that says more about society than it says about me.
641800	643800	Jackie, what you have to understand
643800	646800	is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.
646800	648800	I've talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,
648800	652800	and they agree with me that all this genderqueer bullshit,
652800	653800	it's just a trend.
653800	654800	It's a fad.
654800	655800	But is it?
655800	657800	For thousands of years,
657800	660800	there have been third gender groups across human cultures.
660800	662800	There's the Hidra of India,
662800	665800	the two-spirit people among Native Americans.
665800	670800	Whereas, binary transsexualism is a medical construct of the 20th century.
670800	675800	Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until 2013,
675800	682800	meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.
682800	685800	So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,
685800	689800	and not I who is following a trend.
692800	694800	Wow, that just blew my mind.
694800	696800	The tables are turned, bitch.
696800	702800	Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a trans-trender?
705800	707800	He's not Native American, though.
707800	708800	They.
708800	709800	They.
709800	712800	You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he when you have a fucking beard.
712800	715800	If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,
715800	717800	then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.
717800	720800	Your Honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.
720800	721800	Okay.
721800	724800	Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they.
724800	726800	But what it isn't is two-spirit.
726800	728800	Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.
728800	730800	They think it's racist.
730800	732800	White people have two genders.
732800	733800	Pick one and sit down, dude.
733800	735800	Yeah, that's a good point.
735800	736800	Two genders.
736800	737800	Two genders.
737800	738800	Attack helicopter.
738800	739800	Attack helicopter.
739800	741800	Two genders, only two genders.
741800	742800	How many genders?
742800	743800	Two.
743800	744800	Attack helicopter.
744800	745800	Attack helicopter.
745800	746800	Two genders.
746800	747800	Two genders.
747800	750800	You're just saying that you're me and talking in a whiny voice.
750800	752800	That is not an argument.
756800	762800	You know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal with in life is assholes.
762800	765800	It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it.
765800	767800	Let's be ourselves.
767800	769800	Let's totally be ourselves.
769800	771800	All right, that's enough of this.
771800	776800	You know, as a biological female, I honestly don't understand any of this tranny shit.
776800	778800	Okay, that was a hard T.
778800	783800	Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house and ask me to call him Mommy's Little Slut?
783800	788800	Well, sure, but that is a matter between her and the Lord.
788800	790800	Let's best not think about it too much.
790800	796800	Anyway, Tiffany, my brain has an easier time processing you than whatever is going on over here.
796800	798800	So, congratulations, you're the winner.
798800	801800	That was some excellent free speech.
801800	802800	Okay.
802800	803800	Great.
803800	808800	So, in conclusion, trans-trenders are real and probably dangerous.
808800	810800	Make sure to protect your children.
810800	816800	As for how many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.
816800	818800	All right, that's our show.
818800	822800	This has been the Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.
822800	824800	Except when the show is over.
824800	826800	Get out!
826800	827800	The girl can't help it.
827800	829800	She's a Libra.
834800	839800	Behold, the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected.
839800	844800	They gave their cheek to them that mocked their beard and hid not their face from shame.
844800	850800	But lo, Tiffany, the persecutrix, trendier than thou, a shady queen,
850800	855800	came next upon her friend Justine and sought her counsel thus.
871800	873800	Goddammit, Justine.
873800	875800	I just can't with these trenders anymore.
875800	877800	I simply cannot.
877800	881800	You know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door.
881800	882800	Okay.
882800	884800	Seems a little formal.
884800	885800	Ugh.
885800	887800	You look great, hon.
887800	888800	Cute.
888800	890800	Justine, you look like absolute shit.
890800	891800	What happened?
891800	893800	Did the cat girl finally beat you up?
893800	896800	No, I just—look, I slept in my makeup, okay?
896800	897800	Leave me alone.
897800	898800	I've been having a difficult time.
898800	901800	Are we serving a little depression moment?
901800	902800	Jesus.
902800	904800	Well, don't leave me out.
904800	906800	I saw you on the Freedom Report today.
906800	909800	Okay, girl, can we talk about ladybeard Baltimore, Maryland?
909800	912800	Ugh, add that one to the crazy tranny hall of fame.
912800	913800	Really?
913800	915800	You're happy with the way that went?
915800	916800	You feel good about that?
916800	918800	You feel good about yourself right now?
918800	919800	Well, why wouldn't I?
919800	926800	Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world
926800	930800	than a tran who thinks she's better than other trans.
930800	933800	It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.
933800	935800	You seem to think that you're queen of the world
935800	939800	because you're hanging on to societal acceptance by two fingers instead of one.
939800	940800	Well, you're not, bitch.
940800	943800	You're just an insecure, frightened little queer
943800	948800	who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread other people down.
948800	952800	And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.
954800	956800	Your eyelash is coming unglued.
959800	961800	My life is coming unglued.
962800	963800	Ugh.
963800	966800	Look, it's not like I'm coming after trannies who just can't afford to transition
966800	968800	or don't have the social support.
968800	971800	It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he can to pass
971800	974800	and people just treat him like a freak for no reason.
974800	976800	They. It's they.
976800	978800	Are we really saying they now?
978800	979800	In private?
979800	982800	Yes, we are. So get used to it.
982800	984800	My name is Justine.
984800	988800	I think misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings.
988800	989800	Ugh.
989800	992800	I always forget that you're, like, actually an SJW.
992800	994800	I always forget that you're actually an asshole.
994800	996800	Why do I even hang out with you?
996800	998800	Oh, because you hate yourself?
998800	1000800	And you have to believe there's hope for me?
1000800	1002800	Because if there's hope for me, there might be hope for you?
1002800	1004800	Wow, you're developing self-consciousness.
1004800	1006800	Where'd you learn that trick?
1006800	1007800	Gigi?
1007800	1008800	Tiffany.
1009800	1011800	Have you ever been bullied?
1011800	1013800	Oh, let's see. Let me think.
1013800	1016800	Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day.
1016800	1018800	But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the victim.
1018800	1021800	No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully.
1021800	1024800	I think you grew up getting bullied for being a sissy
1024800	1026800	till you started passing as a woman.
1026800	1028800	And then you got a little taste of normal,
1028800	1031800	and now you want to be the one who bashes the queers.
1031800	1032800	Bash them?
1032800	1034800	If anything, I'm the one defending trans people
1034800	1037800	from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders.
1037800	1041800	You said on air that Baltimore grosses you out.
1041800	1044800	Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here
1044800	1047800	have nothing to do with your own self-loathing?
1047800	1050800	How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is nothing like me?
1050800	1053800	Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse.
1053800	1055800	Oh, it's not bigotry.
1055800	1058800	Look, I shouldn't have said grossed out, I'll give you that,
1058800	1061800	but he does, they do make me uncomfortable.
1061800	1063800	And why do you think that is?
1063800	1068800	Ugh, I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.
1068800	1070800	Ugh, it makes me want to down a bottle of hormones.
1070800	1072800	Make sure I never look like that.
1072800	1074800	Bitch, secondhand dysphoria, what is that?
1074800	1077800	You know when you look at a tranny and you just clock everything
1077800	1081800	and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria?
1081800	1083800	Yeah, I do know what you're talking about,
1083800	1085800	and I'll tell you why it happens.
1085800	1088800	When you're early in your transition and you're doing everything you can to pass,
1088800	1093800	you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little thing that makes you clockable.
1093800	1098800	Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people
1098800	1101800	and you project your dysphoria onto them.
1101800	1102800	I buy that.
1102800	1105800	Yeah, well that is absolutely not a valid reason
1105800	1107800	to police other trans people's presentation.
1107800	1110800	Secondhand dysphoria is not valid.
1110800	1113800	The fact that you project your dysphoria onto other people
1113800	1116800	is your problem and your problem alone.
1116800	1118800	And you need to deal with that issue in private, girl,
1118800	1120800	not on a fucking talk show.
1120800	1123800	Yeah, you're probably right about that.
1123800	1127800	But it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid.
1127800	1130800	Tiffany, let's be pragmatic about this.
1130800	1132800	Suppose everything you're saying is true.
1132800	1136800	Suppose the only real trans people are dysphoric, binary transgender people.
1136800	1137800	Transsexuals.
1137800	1141800	Every time you say the word transsexual, I feel like it's 1978.
1141800	1142800	Are you 80 years old?
1142800	1145800	I guess you could say I'm not the trendiest person.
1145800	1146800	Haha.
1146800	1147800	Look, suppose you're right,
1147800	1150800	and everyone who doesn't meet your definition of a transsexual
1150800	1152800	is some kind of confused trend follower.
1152800	1155800	Even if that were true, and to be clear, it isn't,
1155800	1159800	what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid,
1159800	1161800	because virtually every trans person
1161800	1163800	goes through a period of being confused about their gender
1163800	1165800	and of having nonconforming expression,
1165800	1168800	and you're going around enforcing a stigma against that.
1168800	1170800	Didn't you ever have doubts about your gender?
1170800	1172800	Weren't you ever androgynous?
1172800	1175800	Oh, yeah, I mean, I was never that burgeoning,
1175800	1179800	but I had my little cringe year being a nonbinary SJW.
1179800	1180800	Uh-huh.
1180800	1183800	And one of the great things about nonbinary identities
1183800	1186800	is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist
1186800	1188800	even when neither gender really fits them,
1188800	1191800	whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple months.
1191800	1194800	Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated
1194800	1197800	for being a trender during your exploration year
1197800	1199800	might not have been the most helpful thing?
1199800	1200800	Not really.
1200800	1203800	I have dysphoria, so if anyone called me a trender,
1203800	1205800	I'd eventually prove them wrong.
1205800	1206800	That's all I'm saying.
1206800	1208800	If you're not a trender, then transition.
1208800	1209800	Prove me wrong.
1209800	1211800	But the stigma you perpetuate
1211800	1213800	against gender confusion and experimentation
1213800	1216800	keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition.
1217800	1219800	It alienates baby trans from the community
1219800	1221800	that should be welcoming them
1221800	1223800	instead of publicly humiliating them.
1223800	1226800	And when you appoint yourself the public decider
1226800	1228800	of whomst is really trans,
1228800	1230800	the Torquemada of the trender inquisition,
1230800	1232800	you're terrorizing a lot of people
1232800	1235800	who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.
1235800	1236800	Okay.
1236800	1239800	But then how do we decide which tr**neys are valid?
1239800	1240800	We don't.
1240800	1242800	This is where I'm losing you,
1242800	1245800	because trans trenders are absolutely a thing.
1245800	1246800	Like, undeniably.
1246800	1248800	I've talked to people who've literally told me
1248800	1250800	they used to be trans trenders.
1250800	1252800	So some people question their gender
1252800	1254800	but end up deciding they're not really trans.
1254800	1256800	There is nothing wrong with that,
1256800	1258800	and those people still aren't being helped
1258800	1259800	by public shaming.
1259800	1262800	Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place
1262800	1264800	if SJWs weren't going around telling people
1264800	1266800	they don't need dysphoria to be trans.
1266800	1268800	You know, it's one thing if teenage girls
1268800	1270800	want to dye their hair pink and call themselves
1270800	1272800	demi-boys for most of sophomore year,
1272800	1274800	but some of these kids are actually
1274800	1276800	going to medically transition.
1276800	1278800	And soon, we're going to have an epidemic
1278800	1280800	of detransitioners on our hands.
1280800	1282800	And there's going to be TERFs publishing
1282800	1284800	I-Told-You-So op-eds in every major newspaper.
1284800	1286800	Now, maybe you think that's worth it,
1286800	1288800	just to make sure no one ever feels
1288800	1290800	invalidated for any reason.
1290800	1292800	But I think that's highly irresponsible.
1292800	1294800	Look, if you're so worried about people
1294800	1296800	feeling pressured to medically transition,
1296800	1298800	then what you should be doing is
1298800	1300800	working to make the trans community
1300800	1302800	as inclusive and welcoming as possible
1302800	1304800	to gender non-conforming people
1304800	1306800	and non-binary people, and people who are
1306800	1308800	questioning, and trans people who don't
1308800	1310800	medically transition. But instead,
1310800	1312800	you're doing the exact opposite.
1312800	1314800	You're telling everyone that medical transition
1314800	1316800	is the only way to be valid,
1316800	1318800	and if anything is pressuring people to medically transition,
1318800	1320800	it's that.
1320800	1322800	Justine, I think you're a good person.
1322800	1324800	Maybe too good.
1324800	1326800	And that's why you're trying to have compassion
1326800	1328800	for everyone, but at some point,
1328800	1330800	you have to protect yourself.
1330800	1332800	We live in a world of Jackie Jacksons
1332800	1334800	who don't understand trans people
1334800	1336800	and don't think we're real. So we need
1336800	1338800	to have an explanation of what it is to be trans
1338800	1340800	that's based on facts and not
1340800	1342800	feelings. And the most factual
1342800	1344800	explanation is transmedicalism,
1344800	1346800	which is the idea that transsexualism
1346800	1348800	is a diagnosable mental disorder
1348800	1350800	called gender dysphoria.
1350800	1352800	There's science to back this up, it's accepted
1352800	1354800	by medical professionals, and it clearly
1354800	1356800	explains why we are valid,
1356800	1358800	unlike Rachel Dolezal,
1358800	1360800	and snowflake gender teenagers,
1360800	1362800	and people who identify as cats.
1362800	1364800	Okay, I see the appeal,
1364800	1366800	but I don't think transmedicalism
1366800	1368800	is as validating as you think it is.
1368800	1370800	Why not? I'll put it bluntly.
1370800	1372800	Why does having gender dysphoria
1372800	1374800	make you a woman? Because gender dysphoria
1374800	1376800	means I have a female brain.
1376800	1378800	No it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you,
1378800	1380800	but the science does not say what you think
1380800	1382800	it says. There may be neurological
1382800	1384800	causes of gender dysphoria,
1384800	1386800	but at the end of the day, all dysphoria
1386800	1388800	is is discomfort in a male body,
1388800	1390800	or a male social role, or however you want
1390800	1392800	to put it. And wanting to
1392800	1394800	be a woman is not the same
1394800	1396800	thing as being a
1396800	1398800	woman. Not by any means.
1398800	1400800	Girl, where are you going with this?
1400800	1402800	What is this? Are you becoming a TERF?
1402800	1404800	No, I just don't think your theory actually validates
1404800	1406800	our womanhood. Well, if you're right,
1406800	1408800	that's a real problem. Because
1408800	1410800	we need to have reason, and science,
1410800	1412800	and logic, and facts on our side
1412800	1414800	so that we can explain to society
1414800	1416800	that we are valid, and that we are real,
1416800	1418800	otherwise,
1418800	1420800	bad things. Well, maybe
1420800	1422800	there's a better theory. Well, okay,
1422800	1424800	Socrates, let's hear it then.
1424800	1426800	The way I see it, gender is either
1426800	1428800	psychological, or biological,
1428800	1430800	or social. Now my friend
1430800	1432800	Tabby, the cat girl, she
1432800	1434800	thinks it's all psychological, that it's
1434800	1436800	just identity, that whatever you
1436800	1438800	think about your own gender is true.
1438800	1440800	And that makes me really uncomfortable.
1440800	1442800	Because then, what's the
1442800	1444800	difference between identifying as a woman,
1444800	1446800	and identifying as a Norwegian forest
1446800	1448800	cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself
1448800	1450800	seems not to have much of a
1450800	1452800	grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to
1452800	1454800	tell you about transtrenders this entire time.
1454800	1456800	Just let me finish. If gender is strictly
1456800	1458800	biological, then that's game over
1458800	1460800	for trans people, unless you make some kind
1460800	1462800	of wrong brain and the wrong body argument,
1462800	1464800	but I told you I'm not buying that.
1464800	1466800	So that leaves gender as a social
1466800	1468800	construct. Are you going to try to make me read Judith
1468800	1470800	Butler again? I'll summarize it.
1470800	1472800	Gender is a series of gestures.
1472800	1474800	It's called performativity.
1474800	1476800	It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak.
1476800	1478800	It's the way you act. It's the way you
1478800	1480800	relate to other people. Through
1480800	1482800	transitioning, we habituate to the
1482800	1484800	gestures of womanhood, and socially
1484800	1486800	that makes us women. Regardless
1486800	1488800	of biology or psychology, checkmate
1488800	1490800	transphobes.
1490800	1492800	Okay.
1492800	1494800	The problem with that is that it's both
1494800	1496800	too exclusionary and too
1496800	1498800	inclusive. It excludes a lot of
1498800	1500800	trans people who can't transition for
1500800	1502800	circumstantial reasons, but whose dysphoria
1502800	1504800	is very real. And it includes
1504800	1506800	every trans-trender,
1506800	1508800	drag queen, fetishist, and two-bit
1508800	1510800	cross-dressing comedian in a dine-out
1510800	1512800	wig. Uh. Well.
1512800	1514800	Do you really believe that a man who plays a woman
1514800	1516800	on stage becomes just as much of a
1516800	1518800	woman as you and me?
1518800	1520800	Yes?
1520800	1522800	Bitch, no you don't! Yeah, you're right.
1522800	1524800	I'm full of shit. I know
1524800	1526800	you are. Because you're an SJW.
1526800	1528800	And SJWs hate performativity
1528800	1530800	theory almost as much as they hate me.
1530800	1532800	Well, they only hate it because they don't understand it.
1532800	1534800	They think it invalidates non-binary identities,
1534800	1536800	but in fact it's the most rational way
1536800	1538800	to explain non-binary identities.
1538800	1540800	How can you perform a non-binary
1540800	1542800	identity? Simple. You learn the rules
1542800	1544800	so you can break them. Wearing a
1544800	1546800	beard and a dress communicates ambiguity.
1546800	1548800	Even the gesture of declaring
1548800	1550800	I am neither a man or a woman
1550800	1552800	is a speech act that removes
1552800	1554800	the speaker from the semantics-
1554800	1556800	Shut up. This is too much philosophizing.
1556800	1558800	I can't stand it anymore. Why don't you
1558800	1560800	tell me what's really going on with you?
1560800	1562800	Why do you look like you've been in a K-hole for a week?
1562800	1564800	Why are you suddenly so obsessed with
1564800	1566800	white knighting for non-binary people?
1566800	1568800	Because I am non-binary.
1568800	1570800	No you're not!
1570800	1572800	What are you talking about?
1572800	1574800	I just feel like
1574800	1576800	since I started transitioning I've been trying
1576800	1578800	so hard to fit in and
1578800	1580800	to perform my gender and to pass
1580800	1582800	and to just be normal.
1582800	1584800	But I can't do it anymore.
1584800	1586800	I just cannot make it work.
1586800	1588800	I feel like an actor. I feel like
1588800	1590800	a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions
1590800	1592800	of this new gender role that's supposed
1592800	1594800	to liberate me, but that's somehow
1594800	1596800	just as empty as the old one.
1596800	1598800	Because I'm just not normal, Tiffany.
1598800	1600800	I'm a freak. And I'm always gonna be
1600800	1602800	a freak. Justine, you're not
1602800	1604800	non-binary. You're gay.
1604800	1606800	And everyone can see this except you.
1606800	1608800	Oh come on. I'm not...
1608800	1610800	I'm not gay.
1610800	1612800	Justine
1612800	1614800	was extremely gay.
1614800	1616800	Protest though the lady may,
1616800	1618800	there simply is no stopping gayness.
1618800	1620800	I love
1620800	1622800	cat girls!
1622800	1624800	I hate
1624800	1626800	cat girls, but I also love them!
1626800	1628800	Oh
1628800	1630800	abominable fate.
1630800	1632800	Okay. So I'm a little bit
1632800	1634800	gay. Right. And you don't know how to reconcile
1634800	1636800	your attraction to women with your desire
1636800	1638800	to perform your gender. That's why you
1638800	1640800	feel this dissonance. Yeah.
1640800	1642800	I guess that's basically it.
1642800	1644800	Well it really shouldn't be that hard, girl.
1644800	1646800	You already came out as a woman, just blurt it out.
1646800	1648800	Say, hello world,
1648800	1650800	my name is Justine
1650800	1652800	and I fuck pussy.
1652800	1654800	That's a very cis-normative way to say it.
1654800	1656800	Hello world,
1656800	1658800	my name is Justine and
1658800	1660800	I fuck pussy?
1660800	1662800	Ugh. I feel like a man
1662800	1664800	when I say it. Yeah, well you should probably
1664800	1666800	buy a pickup truck then.
1666800	1668800	Get some of those mud flaps on the back
1668800	1670800	with the little sexy ladies on them and
1670800	1672800	you may as well change your name back to
1672800	1674800	Justine. Okay, well that's
1674800	1676800	just uncalled for. Girl, I don't know what to
1676800	1678800	say except I told you so. Sexuality
1678800	1680800	is just like gender identity.
1680800	1682800	It is not a performance, it's not a
1682800	1684800	trend, it's not a choice, it's
1684800	1686800	just part of who you are and there's
1686800	1688800	nothing you can do to change it.
1688800	1690800	I guess
1690800	1692800	you're right. I guess my theory sucks.
1692800	1694800	It sucks so fucking hard,
1694800	1696800	but the good news is you can
1696800	1698800	unclench your asshole now and do whatever you
1698800	1700800	want because you're still a woman whether you're
1700800	1702800	performing a stereotype or not.
1702800	1704800	So run free, Justine.
1704800	1706800	Go top a cis woman.
1706800	1708800	Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized
1708800	1710800	flannel. Do whatever you want.
1710800	1712800	Wow, yeah, I guess
1712800	1714800	that is pretty liberating. Yeah,
1714800	1716800	thank god for transmedicalism, right?
1716800	1718800	Oh, except not
1718800	1720800	because you just destroyed transmedicalism
1720800	1722800	with facts and logic, so we have no
1722800	1724800	theory. We have no theory, Justine.
1724800	1726800	What do we do now? How do we prove
1726800	1728800	we're valid? Well, just do what every trans
1728800	1730800	woman has done since the beginning of time.
1730800	1732800	Go out and fuck the most brutally
1732800	1734800	heterosexual man you can find and
1734800	1736800	be validated and come.
1736800	1738800	Oh, honey, I have and I will,
1738800	1740800	but that's not gonna convince anyone but
1740800	1742800	me. It's not a proof.
1742800	1744800	It's not a theory. Well, maybe
1744800	1746800	we don't need a theory. Maybe we
1746800	1748800	don't need to prove anything.
1748800	1750800	Bad things, Justine. Bad things.
1750800	1752800	Well, do we have a theory about why
1752800	1754800	people are gay? No. They just
1754800	1756800	are. The only reason we even feel
1756800	1758800	like we need a theory about trans people
1758800	1760800	is that society is so unaccepting
1760800	1762800	of us that it's constantly demanding
1762800	1764800	we justify our own reality.
1764800	1766800	Okay, so what am I supposed to tell Jackie
1766800	1768800	Jackson, then? What am I supposed to tell
1768800	1770800	the TERFs? That I'm a woman because
1770800	1772800	reasons? No. Not
1772800	1774800	even because reasons. Just
1774800	1776800	because you are. So it's what? A leap
1776800	1778800	of faith? Oh, great.
1778800	1780800	I'm sure that's gonna convince all the rational
1780800	1782800	skeptics. Justine,
1782800	1784800	it makes us sound completely delusional.
1784800	1786800	Well, Tiffany, delusion
1786800	1788800	is what separates us from the
1788800	1790800	animals. Who do you think built the pyramids
1790800	1792800	and the cathedrals? Clearly not people
1792800	1794800	with a perfectly rational worldview.
1794800	1796800	But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one who thinks
1796800	1798800	being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't
1798800	1800800	describe it as the height of sanity,
1800800	1802800	but I would prefer to think that my whole
1802800	1804800	life and identity is based on something I
1804800	1806800	can rationally explain. Well, what are
1806800	1808800	we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the
1808800	1810800	single most obnoxious thing about men
1810800	1812800	that they think they have to wrap up the entire
1812800	1814800	world in a little rational box?
1814800	1816800	Maybe the most important
1816800	1818800	things in life can't be logically
1818800	1820800	proved. Can you logically prove
1820800	1822800	that you love your own children?
1822800	1824800	No. And the attempt to prove
1824800	1826800	it is as degrading as it is
1826800	1828800	futile. Maybe gender identity
1828800	1830800	is one of those things.
1830800	1832800	Okay, but then how do I
1832800	1834800	prove I'm more valid than Baltimore,
1834800	1836800	Maryland, and the star genders,
1836800	1838800	and the cat people? Well, maybe
1838800	1840800	we should stop getting so caught up
1840800	1842800	in proving our validity to ourselves
1842800	1844800	that we end up being horribly cruel
1844800	1846800	to other people. What if we just accept
1846800	1848800	all the freaks of the world?
1848800	1850800	At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as
1850800	1852800	important to have logical proofs as it
1852800	1854800	is to be empathetic and open-minded
1854800	1856800	and compassionate.
1856800	1858800	Kumbaya,
1858800	1860800	my lord,
1860800	1862800	kumbaya.
1862800	1864800	Kumbaya, my lord,
1864800	1866800	kumbaya.
1866800	1868800	Kumbaya, my lord,
1868800	1870800	kumbaya.
1870800	1872800	Kumbaya.
1872800	1874800	I have something to tell you.
1874800	1876800	Here it comes.
1876800	1878800	I love you.
1878800	1880800	Okay.
1880800	1882800	Well, I'm going to get going now.
1882800	1884800	I have an important
1884800	1886800	date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries
1886800	1888800	and reading YouTube comments by myself,
1888800	1890800	so I'd really
1890800	1892800	better go do that, but
1892800	1894800	good luck with your new
1894800	1896800	life as a male lesbian who fucks cats.
1896800	1898800	Ugh.
1900800	1902800	Oh, are you upset?
1902800	1904800	Just go.
1904800	1906800	I'm sorry.
1908800	1910800	Ugh. I hate
1910800	1912800	this bitch.
1912800	1914800	But god, she's a yum-yum.
1914800	1916800	Harken, children.
1916800	1918800	In this vision you have witnessed
1918800	1920800	mortal fools upon the screen.
1920800	1922800	Fools who do not love
1922800	1924800	themselves. But I,
1924800	1926800	your goddess, mother, queen,
1926800	1928800	messiah, I am
1928800	1930800	nothing like them.
1930800	1932800	For I am truth.
1932800	1934800	I am light.
1934800	1936800	I am in capitalism.
1936800	1938800	And everything I tweet is
1938800	1940800	woke. But most importantly,
1940800	1942800	I am not a
1942800	1944800	woke. But most importantly,
1944800	1946800	I love myself.
1946800	1948800	I love myself so much it makes me wet.
1948800	1950800	It makes me cum.
1950800	1952800	Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.
1952800	1954800	Like, comment, and subscribe.
1954800	1956800	Amen.
