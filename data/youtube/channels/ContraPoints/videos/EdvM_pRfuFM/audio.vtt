00:00.000 --> 00:12.600
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital

00:12.600 --> 00:20.000
messiah, the online oracle, the social media saviour, yea, verily I say unto you, there

00:20.000 --> 00:25.800
were influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night, and lo,

00:25.800 --> 00:31.800
I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
a vision.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.800
Freedom, freedom, fuckin' freedom.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.800
Which matters more?

00:47.800 --> 00:51.800
The freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
of a jackboot?

00:52.800 --> 00:58.800
As a centrist, I am undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.800
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss

01:03.800 --> 01:07.800
important issues, like Mexicans, how dangerous are they?

01:07.800 --> 01:09.800
Muslims, can we stop them?

01:09.800 --> 01:14.800
Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children

01:14.800 --> 01:17.800
into all manner of half-and-halves and in-betweens.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.800
I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
It makes me want to throw up.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.800
I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
Cut the music!

01:31.800 --> 01:36.800
Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
opinion haver.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.800
And my second guest...

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Well, what the hell are you?

01:40.800 --> 01:45.800
You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
your deal?

01:46.800 --> 01:54.800
Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal is I don't like society forcing me into tiny

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
little boxes.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.800
Okay, but are you a man or a woman?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Just tell me.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.800
Well, why does it matter?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
Why do you have to know?

02:02.800 --> 02:07.800
Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these

02:07.800 --> 02:10.800
little categories, Jackie Jackson.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.800
Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

02:16.800 --> 02:18.800
My name is Baltimore.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.800
Baltimore what?

02:20.800 --> 02:22.800
Baltimore, Maryland.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.800
I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.800
It is among my names.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.800
Tiffany, what do you make of this?

02:30.800 --> 02:33.800
Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.800
I am a transsexual.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.800
That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.800
I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.800
This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones

02:48.800 --> 02:51.800
and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
It is not a fashion statement.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
It is not a trend.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.800
It is not an easy way to feel special and depressed.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.800
It is a very difficult condition to live with.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
I'm dying inside.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.800
Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.800
No, I am a transsexual.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
That is not a transsexual.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
That is a trans-trender.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
Trans-trender?

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
What is that?

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
Is that a gender?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.800
No, it's not a gender.

03:17.800 --> 03:23.800
A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here who puts on a dress and puts glitter in his beard

03:23.800 --> 03:29.800
and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
Actually, it's they.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.800
What?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
I use they, them pronouns.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.800
Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.800
Have I complained about oppression so far?

03:43.800 --> 03:49.800
It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.

03:49.800 --> 03:54.800
Isn't it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.800
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.800
I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
It's in my brain.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
I was diagnosed.

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
It's a fact.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.800
It's real.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
My pain is real.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.800
And my pain isn't real?

04:09.800 --> 04:12.800
It's interesting that you think that.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.800
Well, what pain are you talking about?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.800
People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?

04:17.800 --> 04:21.800
Interesting that you mention the circus, Tiffany Tumbles.

04:21.800 --> 04:27.800
Don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
You're not confined anywhere.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
You choose to dress like that.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Hello.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.800
And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.

04:42.800 --> 04:48.800
Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
Well, it's a free country.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.800
If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.800
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender

04:56.800 --> 04:59.800
because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.800
But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?

05:03.800 --> 05:07.800
Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?

05:07.800 --> 05:11.800
Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.800
That is simply adding another cell to the prison.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
It's not about conforming.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.800
It's about me having an actual medical condition.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.800
You do not have a female brain.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
You have a fashion disaster.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
Oh, do they?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.800
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
when the doctor prescribed your hormones,

05:31.800 --> 05:34.800
did he take a look at your brain then?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.800
What? Of course not.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.800
But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

05:40.800 --> 05:43.800
Well, no. Where are you going with this?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.800
I mean, if you've never seen your brain

05:46.800 --> 05:50.800
and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,

05:50.800 --> 05:53.800
then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

05:53.800 --> 05:57.800
how do you know that you have a female brain?

06:01.800 --> 06:02.800
Bullshit.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
That's a good point.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
No, it isn't.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.800
Look, there's scientific studies that...

06:06.800 --> 06:11.800
Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.800
Are they different colors?

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
I'm not an expert,

06:15.800 --> 06:18.800
but there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
I see.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.800
But your doctor never looked at your brain.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.800
So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.800
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.800
And you told him what, exactly?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
That I experience gender dysphoria.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.800
So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

06:38.800 --> 06:40.800
and therefore your identity,

06:40.800 --> 06:45.800
is valid not because of any observed facts about your brain,

06:45.800 --> 06:48.800
but because of your...

06:48.800 --> 06:52.800
...feelings?

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
You backed me into a corner.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
Sure, it's because of my feelings.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
My feelings of gender dysphoria.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.800
So, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

07:03.800 --> 07:08.800
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
but mine, according to you, are not?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
This burgeoning brick.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.800
You guys, let's think about this.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.800
If I've never seen my brain,

07:20.800 --> 07:23.800
how do I know I even have a brain?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.800
Well, you probably don't, girl.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.800
Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.800
And if you feel cloud gender or deminebula or astroglide

07:33.800 --> 07:36.800
or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,

07:36.800 --> 07:38.800
then you do you, girl.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.800
Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
But I want to make one thing very clear.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.800
I am nothing like you, okay?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
My gender is not unicorns and glitter.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.800
My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
No, not even you.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?

08:01.800 --> 08:05.800
No, well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.800
You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria

08:08.800 --> 08:11.800
that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community

08:11.800 --> 08:14.800
when, in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.800
Your pain?

08:16.800 --> 08:20.800
You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?

08:20.800 --> 08:25.800
Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.800
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.800
I pity you because you don't think you're real

08:30.800 --> 08:34.800
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.800
And I can't imagine what it must be like

08:38.800 --> 08:42.800
to have so little confidence in your own reality.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.800
Okay, well, don't patronize me.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.800
I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,

08:47.800 --> 08:52.800
why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself and hating your body.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.800
Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?

08:56.800 --> 08:59.800
No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,

08:59.800 --> 09:01.800
but you do have to have dysphoria.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.800
And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.800
I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.800
Would you please join me in saying a prayer for your wellness?

09:13.800 --> 09:17.800
Actually, I would strongly prefer if you would stay away from any of my rifts.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.800
Oh, goddess of light, please shield and protect Tiffany

09:20.800 --> 09:23.800
against the ravages of inner strife.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.800
Enclose her in your loving arms

09:25.800 --> 09:30.800
and cleanse her of all condemnation and internalized transphobia.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
I entreat you, oh great mother,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.800
bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care

09:35.800 --> 09:39.800
and rid her of her toxic, cis-normative, true-scum ways.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
Amen.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
Are we done here?

09:41.800 --> 09:45.800
I don't think I can make it through any more readings from the SJW prayer book.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.800
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love I am trying to deliver unto you?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
Because I'm grossed out by you. That's why.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
Okay, then.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.800
Well, namaste, bitch.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.800
Look, why don't we all take a step back

09:58.800 --> 10:02.800
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform

10:02.800 --> 10:05.800
and let them know how much we appreciate their service.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.800
God, I love the troops.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
Thinking about the troops makes me wet.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
It makes me cum.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.800
Semper fi, boys.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.800
What?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.800
Tiffany, your transsexualism,

10:23.800 --> 10:25.800
I have to say I don't love it,

10:25.800 --> 10:29.800
but you do seem to at least be aware that you have some kind of mental disorder,

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
so I'll give you that.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.800
Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?

10:34.800 --> 10:35.800
Making some kind of statement?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.800
If my existence is a statement,

10:37.800 --> 10:41.800
I think that says more about society than it says about me.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.800
Jackie, what you have to understand

10:43.800 --> 10:46.800
is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
I've talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,

10:48.800 --> 10:52.800
and they agree with me that all this genderqueer bullshit,

10:52.800 --> 10:53.800
it's just a trend.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
It's a fad.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
But is it?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.800
For thousands of years,

10:57.800 --> 11:00.800
there have been third gender groups across human cultures.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.800
There's the Hidra of India,

11:02.800 --> 11:05.800
the two-spirit people among Native Americans.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.800
Whereas, binary transsexualism is a medical construct of the 20th century.

11:10.800 --> 11:15.800
Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition until 2013,

11:15.800 --> 11:22.800
meaning that Tumblr is twice as old as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.800
So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
and not I who is following a trend.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.800
Wow, that just blew my mind.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.800
The tables are turned, bitch.

11:36.800 --> 11:42.800
Tiffany, could you explain to me why you decided to become a trans-trender?

11:45.800 --> 11:47.800
He's not Native American, though.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
They.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
They.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.800
You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he when you have a fucking beard.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.800
If you were actually trans and you actually had dysphoria,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.800
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.800
Your Honor, in my defense, it is a glitter beard.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
Okay.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.800
Well, that's very 2019, very gender, very they.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.800
But what it isn't is two-spirit.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
They think it's racist.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.800
White people have two genders.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
Pick one and sit down, dude.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.800
Yeah, that's a good point.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.800
Two genders.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
Two genders.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
Attack helicopter.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
Attack helicopter.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.800
Two genders, only two genders.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.800
How many genders?

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
Two.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.800
Attack helicopter.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
Attack helicopter.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
Two genders.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.800
Two genders.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.800
You're just saying that you're me and talking in a whiny voice.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
That is not an argument.

12:36.800 --> 12:42.800
You know, kids, the one thing you'll always have to deal with in life is assholes.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.800
It's hard to be yourself, but it's worth it.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
Let's be ourselves.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
Let's totally be ourselves.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
All right, that's enough of this.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.800
You know, as a biological female, I honestly don't understand any of this tranny shit.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.800
Okay, that was a hard T.

12:58.800 --> 13:03.800
Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house and ask me to call him Mommy's Little Slut?

13:03.800 --> 13:08.800
Well, sure, but that is a matter between her and the Lord.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.800
Let's best not think about it too much.

13:10.800 --> 13:16.800
Anyway, Tiffany, my brain has an easier time processing you than whatever is going on over here.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.800
So, congratulations, you're the winner.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.800
That was some excellent free speech.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.800
Okay.

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
Great.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.800
So, in conclusion, trans-trenders are real and probably dangerous.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.800
Make sure to protect your children.

13:30.800 --> 13:36.800
As for how many genders there are, you know, I'm going to take the centrist route and say two and a half.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
All right, that's our show.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.800
This has been the Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.800
Except when the show is over.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
Get out!

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
The girl can't help it.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.800
She's a Libra.

13:54.800 --> 13:59.800
Behold, the non-binary lamb who was despised and rejected.

13:59.800 --> 14:04.800
They gave their cheek to them that mocked their beard and hid not their face from shame.

14:04.800 --> 14:10.800
But lo, Tiffany, the persecutrix, trendier than thou, a shady queen,

14:10.800 --> 14:15.800
came next upon her friend Justine and sought her counsel thus.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.800
Goddammit, Justine.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
I just can't with these trenders anymore.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
I simply cannot.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.800
You know, you can just text me here and I'll come open the door.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Okay.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
Seems a little formal.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Ugh.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
You look great, hon.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
Cute.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
Justine, you look like absolute shit.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.800
What happened?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
Did the cat girl finally beat you up?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.800
No, I just—look, I slept in my makeup, okay?

14:56.800 --> 14:57.800
Leave me alone.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.800
I've been having a difficult time.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.800
Are we serving a little depression moment?

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800
Jesus.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
Well, don't leave me out.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.800
I saw you on the Freedom Report today.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.800
Okay, girl, can we talk about ladybeard Baltimore, Maryland?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.800
Ugh, add that one to the crazy tranny hall of fame.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.800
Really?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.800
You're happy with the way that went?

15:15.800 --> 15:16.800
You feel good about that?

15:16.800 --> 15:18.800
You feel good about yourself right now?

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Well, why wouldn't I?

15:19.800 --> 15:26.800
Tiffany, there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world

15:26.800 --> 15:30.800
than a tran who thinks she's better than other trans.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.800
It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.800
You seem to think that you're queen of the world

15:35.800 --> 15:39.800
because you're hanging on to societal acceptance by two fingers instead of one.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.800
Well, you're not, bitch.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.800
You're just an insecure, frightened little queer

15:43.800 --> 15:48.800
who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread other people down.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.800
And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.800
Your eyelash is coming unglued.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.800
My life is coming unglued.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Ugh.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.800
Look, it's not like I'm coming after trannies who just can't afford to transition

16:06.800 --> 16:08.800
or don't have the social support.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.800
It's not like Baltimore is doing everything he can to pass

16:11.800 --> 16:14.800
and people just treat him like a freak for no reason.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.800
They. It's they.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
Are we really saying they now?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.800
In private?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.800
Yes, we are. So get used to it.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.800
My name is Justine.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.800
I think misgendering is toxic because I care about people's feelings.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.800
Ugh.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.800
I always forget that you're, like, actually an SJW.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.800
I always forget that you're actually an asshole.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.800
Why do I even hang out with you?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.800
Oh, because you hate yourself?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.800
And you have to believe there's hope for me?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
Because if there's hope for me, there might be hope for you?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
Wow, you're developing self-consciousness.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
Where'd you learn that trick?

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
Gigi?

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
Tiffany.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
Have you ever been bullied?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.800
Oh, let's see. Let me think.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.800
Oh, only K through 12, nine hours a day.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
But you don't see me going on talk shows to play the victim.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.800
No, I see you going on talk shows to play the bully.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.800
I think you grew up getting bullied for being a sissy

17:04.800 --> 17:06.800
till you started passing as a woman.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
And then you got a little taste of normal,

17:08.800 --> 17:11.800
and now you want to be the one who bashes the queers.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
Bash them?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.800
If anything, I'm the one defending trans people

17:14.800 --> 17:17.800
from appropriation and misrepresentation by these trenders.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.800
You said on air that Baltimore grosses you out.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.800
Do you really expect me to believe that your motivations here

17:24.800 --> 17:27.800
have nothing to do with your own self-loathing?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.800
How could it be self-loathing when Baltimore is nothing like me?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.800
Okay, then it's just bigotry. That's even worse.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.800
Oh, it's not bigotry.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.800
Look, I shouldn't have said grossed out, I'll give you that,

17:38.800 --> 17:41.800
but he does, they do make me uncomfortable.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.800
And why do you think that is?

17:43.800 --> 17:48.800
Ugh, I got secondhand dysphoria looking at someone so burgeoning.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
Ugh, it makes me want to down a bottle of hormones.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.800
Make sure I never look like that.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
Bitch, secondhand dysphoria, what is that?

17:54.800 --> 17:57.800
You know when you look at a tranny and you just clock everything

17:57.800 --> 18:01.800
and you feel like sympathetic vibrations of dysphoria?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.800
Yeah, I do know what you're talking about,

18:03.800 --> 18:05.800
and I'll tell you why it happens.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.800
When you're early in your transition and you're doing everything you can to pass,

18:08.800 --> 18:13.800
you develop a really sophisticated eye for every little thing that makes you clockable.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.800
Then you turn that sophisticated eye onto other trans people

18:18.800 --> 18:21.800
and you project your dysphoria onto them.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.800
I buy that.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.800
Yeah, well that is absolutely not a valid reason

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
to police other trans people's presentation.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.800
Secondhand dysphoria is not valid.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.800
The fact that you project your dysphoria onto other people

18:33.800 --> 18:36.800
is your problem and your problem alone.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.800
And you need to deal with that issue in private, girl,

18:38.800 --> 18:40.800
not on a fucking talk show.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.800
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.800
But it still doesn't make Baltimore, Maryland any more valid.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.800
Tiffany, let's be pragmatic about this.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
Suppose everything you're saying is true.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.800
Suppose the only real trans people are dysphoric, binary transgender people.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
Transsexuals.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.800
Every time you say the word transsexual, I feel like it's 1978.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
Are you 80 years old?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
I guess you could say I'm not the trendiest person.

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
Haha.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
Look, suppose you're right,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.800
and everyone who doesn't meet your definition of a transsexual

19:10.800 --> 19:12.800
is some kind of confused trend follower.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.800
Even if that were true, and to be clear, it isn't,

19:15.800 --> 19:19.800
what you're doing harms even the trans people you think are valid,

19:19.800 --> 19:21.800
because virtually every trans person

19:21.800 --> 19:23.800
goes through a period of being confused about their gender

19:23.800 --> 19:25.800
and of having nonconforming expression,

19:25.800 --> 19:28.800
and you're going around enforcing a stigma against that.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
Didn't you ever have doubts about your gender?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.800
Weren't you ever androgynous?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.800
Oh, yeah, I mean, I was never that burgeoning,

19:35.800 --> 19:39.800
but I had my little cringe year being a nonbinary SJW.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.800
Uh-huh.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.800
And one of the great things about nonbinary identities

19:43.800 --> 19:46.800
is they give trans people the conceptual space to exist

19:46.800 --> 19:48.800
even when neither gender really fits them,

19:48.800 --> 19:51.800
whether that's for their entire life or just for a couple months.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.800
Hasn't it occurred to you that being shamed and berated

19:54.800 --> 19:57.800
for being a trender during your exploration year

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800
might not have been the most helpful thing?

19:59.800 --> 20:00.800
Not really.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.800
I have dysphoria, so if anyone called me a trender,

20:03.800 --> 20:05.800
I'd eventually prove them wrong.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.800
That's all I'm saying.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
If you're not a trender, then transition.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.800
Prove me wrong.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.800
But the stigma you perpetuate

20:11.800 --> 20:13.800
against gender confusion and experimentation

20:13.800 --> 20:16.800
keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.800
It alienates baby trans from the community

20:19.800 --> 20:21.800
that should be welcoming them

20:21.800 --> 20:23.800
instead of publicly humiliating them.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.800
And when you appoint yourself the public decider

20:26.800 --> 20:28.800
of whomst is really trans,

20:28.800 --> 20:30.800
the Torquemada of the trender inquisition,

20:30.800 --> 20:32.800
you're terrorizing a lot of people

20:32.800 --> 20:35.800
who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
Okay.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.800
But then how do we decide which tr**neys are valid?

20:39.800 --> 20:40.800
We don't.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.800
This is where I'm losing you,

20:42.800 --> 20:45.800
because trans trenders are absolutely a thing.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
Like, undeniably.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
I've talked to people who've literally told me

20:48.800 --> 20:50.800
they used to be trans trenders.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.800
So some people question their gender

20:52.800 --> 20:54.800
but end up deciding they're not really trans.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.800
There is nothing wrong with that,

20:56.800 --> 20:58.800
and those people still aren't being helped

20:58.800 --> 20:59.800
by public shaming.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.800
Well, maybe they wouldn't be confused in the first place

21:02.800 --> 21:04.800
if SJWs weren't going around telling people

21:04.800 --> 21:06.800
they don't need dysphoria to be trans.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.800
You know, it's one thing if teenage girls

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
want to dye their hair pink and call themselves

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
demi-boys for most of sophomore year,

21:12.800 --> 21:14.800
but some of these kids are actually

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
going to medically transition.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.800
And soon, we're going to have an epidemic

21:18.800 --> 21:20.800
of detransitioners on our hands.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.800
And there's going to be TERFs publishing

21:22.800 --> 21:24.800
I-Told-You-So op-eds in every major newspaper.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
Now, maybe you think that's worth it,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
just to make sure no one ever feels

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
invalidated for any reason.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.800
But I think that's highly irresponsible.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.800
Look, if you're so worried about people

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
feeling pressured to medically transition,

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
then what you should be doing is

21:38.800 --> 21:40.800
working to make the trans community

21:40.800 --> 21:42.800
as inclusive and welcoming as possible

21:42.800 --> 21:44.800
to gender non-conforming people

21:44.800 --> 21:46.800
and non-binary people, and people who are

21:46.800 --> 21:48.800
questioning, and trans people who don't

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
medically transition. But instead,

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
you're doing the exact opposite.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.800
You're telling everyone that medical transition

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
is the only way to be valid,

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
and if anything is pressuring people to medically transition,

21:58.800 --> 22:00.800
it's that.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
Justine, I think you're a good person.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.800
Maybe too good.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.800
And that's why you're trying to have compassion

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
for everyone, but at some point,

22:08.800 --> 22:10.800
you have to protect yourself.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
We live in a world of Jackie Jacksons

22:12.800 --> 22:14.800
who don't understand trans people

22:14.800 --> 22:16.800
and don't think we're real. So we need

22:16.800 --> 22:18.800
to have an explanation of what it is to be trans

22:18.800 --> 22:20.800
that's based on facts and not

22:20.800 --> 22:22.800
feelings. And the most factual

22:22.800 --> 22:24.800
explanation is transmedicalism,

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
which is the idea that transsexualism

22:26.800 --> 22:28.800
is a diagnosable mental disorder

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
called gender dysphoria.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.800
There's science to back this up, it's accepted

22:32.800 --> 22:34.800
by medical professionals, and it clearly

22:34.800 --> 22:36.800
explains why we are valid,

22:36.800 --> 22:38.800
unlike Rachel Dolezal,

22:38.800 --> 22:40.800
and snowflake gender teenagers,

22:40.800 --> 22:42.800
and people who identify as cats.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.800
Okay, I see the appeal,

22:44.800 --> 22:46.800
but I don't think transmedicalism

22:46.800 --> 22:48.800
is as validating as you think it is.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
Why not? I'll put it bluntly.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
Why does having gender dysphoria

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
make you a woman? Because gender dysphoria

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
means I have a female brain.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.800
No it doesn't. I'm sorry to tell you,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.800
but the science does not say what you think

23:00.800 --> 23:02.800
it says. There may be neurological

23:02.800 --> 23:04.800
causes of gender dysphoria,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.800
but at the end of the day, all dysphoria

23:06.800 --> 23:08.800
is is discomfort in a male body,

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
or a male social role, or however you want

23:10.800 --> 23:12.800
to put it. And wanting to

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
be a woman is not the same

23:14.800 --> 23:16.800
thing as being a

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
woman. Not by any means.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
Girl, where are you going with this?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.800
What is this? Are you becoming a TERF?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.800
No, I just don't think your theory actually validates

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
our womanhood. Well, if you're right,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
that's a real problem. Because

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
we need to have reason, and science,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
and logic, and facts on our side

23:32.800 --> 23:34.800
so that we can explain to society

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
that we are valid, and that we are real,

23:36.800 --> 23:38.800
otherwise,

23:38.800 --> 23:40.800
bad things. Well, maybe

23:40.800 --> 23:42.800
there's a better theory. Well, okay,

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
Socrates, let's hear it then.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.800
The way I see it, gender is either

23:46.800 --> 23:48.800
psychological, or biological,

23:48.800 --> 23:50.800
or social. Now my friend

23:50.800 --> 23:52.800
Tabby, the cat girl, she

23:52.800 --> 23:54.800
thinks it's all psychological, that it's

23:54.800 --> 23:56.800
just identity, that whatever you

23:56.800 --> 23:58.800
think about your own gender is true.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.800
And that makes me really uncomfortable.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
Because then, what's the

24:02.800 --> 24:04.800
difference between identifying as a woman,

24:04.800 --> 24:06.800
and identifying as a Norwegian forest

24:06.800 --> 24:08.800
cat? It's a difference that Tabby herself

24:08.800 --> 24:10.800
seems not to have much of a

24:10.800 --> 24:12.800
grip on. Girl, that's literally what I've been trying to

24:12.800 --> 24:14.800
tell you about transtrenders this entire time.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
Just let me finish. If gender is strictly

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
biological, then that's game over

24:18.800 --> 24:20.800
for trans people, unless you make some kind

24:20.800 --> 24:22.800
of wrong brain and the wrong body argument,

24:22.800 --> 24:24.800
but I told you I'm not buying that.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.800
So that leaves gender as a social

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
construct. Are you going to try to make me read Judith

24:28.800 --> 24:30.800
Butler again? I'll summarize it.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.800
Gender is a series of gestures.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.800
It's called performativity.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.800
It's the way you dress. It's the way you speak.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.800
It's the way you act. It's the way you

24:38.800 --> 24:40.800
relate to other people. Through

24:40.800 --> 24:42.800
transitioning, we habituate to the

24:42.800 --> 24:44.800
gestures of womanhood, and socially

24:44.800 --> 24:46.800
that makes us women. Regardless

24:46.800 --> 24:48.800
of biology or psychology, checkmate

24:48.800 --> 24:50.800
transphobes.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.800
Okay.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.800
The problem with that is that it's both

24:54.800 --> 24:56.800
too exclusionary and too

24:56.800 --> 24:58.800
inclusive. It excludes a lot of

24:58.800 --> 25:00.800
trans people who can't transition for

25:00.800 --> 25:02.800
circumstantial reasons, but whose dysphoria

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
is very real. And it includes

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
every trans-trender,

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
drag queen, fetishist, and two-bit

25:08.800 --> 25:10.800
cross-dressing comedian in a dine-out

25:10.800 --> 25:12.800
wig. Uh. Well.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.800
Do you really believe that a man who plays a woman

25:14.800 --> 25:16.800
on stage becomes just as much of a

25:16.800 --> 25:18.800
woman as you and me?

25:18.800 --> 25:20.800
Yes?

25:20.800 --> 25:22.800
Bitch, no you don't! Yeah, you're right.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
I'm full of shit. I know

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
you are. Because you're an SJW.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.800
And SJWs hate performativity

25:28.800 --> 25:30.800
theory almost as much as they hate me.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.800
Well, they only hate it because they don't understand it.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
They think it invalidates non-binary identities,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.800
but in fact it's the most rational way

25:36.800 --> 25:38.800
to explain non-binary identities.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
How can you perform a non-binary

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
identity? Simple. You learn the rules

25:42.800 --> 25:44.800
so you can break them. Wearing a

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
beard and a dress communicates ambiguity.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
Even the gesture of declaring

25:48.800 --> 25:50.800
I am neither a man or a woman

25:50.800 --> 25:52.800
is a speech act that removes

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
the speaker from the semantics-

25:54.800 --> 25:56.800
Shut up. This is too much philosophizing.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.800
I can't stand it anymore. Why don't you

25:58.800 --> 26:00.800
tell me what's really going on with you?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
Why do you look like you've been in a K-hole for a week?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.800
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with

26:04.800 --> 26:06.800
white knighting for non-binary people?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.800
Because I am non-binary.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.800
No you're not!

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
What are you talking about?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.800
I just feel like

26:14.800 --> 26:16.800
since I started transitioning I've been trying

26:16.800 --> 26:18.800
so hard to fit in and

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
to perform my gender and to pass

26:20.800 --> 26:22.800
and to just be normal.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.800
But I can't do it anymore.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.800
I just cannot make it work.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.800
I feel like an actor. I feel like

26:28.800 --> 26:30.800
a zombie. Like I'm going through the motions

26:30.800 --> 26:32.800
of this new gender role that's supposed

26:32.800 --> 26:34.800
to liberate me, but that's somehow

26:34.800 --> 26:36.800
just as empty as the old one.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.800
Because I'm just not normal, Tiffany.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.800
I'm a freak. And I'm always gonna be

26:40.800 --> 26:42.800
a freak. Justine, you're not

26:42.800 --> 26:44.800
non-binary. You're gay.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.800
And everyone can see this except you.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.800
Oh come on. I'm not...

26:48.800 --> 26:50.800
I'm not gay.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.800
Justine

26:52.800 --> 26:54.800
was extremely gay.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.800
Protest though the lady may,

26:56.800 --> 26:58.800
there simply is no stopping gayness.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.800
I love

27:00.800 --> 27:02.800
cat girls!

27:02.800 --> 27:04.800
I hate

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
cat girls, but I also love them!

27:06.800 --> 27:08.800
Oh

27:08.800 --> 27:10.800
abominable fate.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
Okay. So I'm a little bit

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
gay. Right. And you don't know how to reconcile

27:14.800 --> 27:16.800
your attraction to women with your desire

27:16.800 --> 27:18.800
to perform your gender. That's why you

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
feel this dissonance. Yeah.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.800
I guess that's basically it.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.800
Well it really shouldn't be that hard, girl.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.800
You already came out as a woman, just blurt it out.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
Say, hello world,

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
my name is Justine

27:30.800 --> 27:32.800
and I fuck pussy.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
That's a very cis-normative way to say it.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.800
Hello world,

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
my name is Justine and

27:38.800 --> 27:40.800
I fuck pussy?

27:40.800 --> 27:42.800
Ugh. I feel like a man

27:42.800 --> 27:44.800
when I say it. Yeah, well you should probably

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
buy a pickup truck then.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.800
Get some of those mud flaps on the back

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
with the little sexy ladies on them and

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
you may as well change your name back to

27:52.800 --> 27:54.800
Justine. Okay, well that's

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
just uncalled for. Girl, I don't know what to

27:56.800 --> 27:58.800
say except I told you so. Sexuality

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
is just like gender identity.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.800
It is not a performance, it's not a

28:02.800 --> 28:04.800
trend, it's not a choice, it's

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
just part of who you are and there's

28:06.800 --> 28:08.800
nothing you can do to change it.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.800
I guess

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
you're right. I guess my theory sucks.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.800
It sucks so fucking hard,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.800
but the good news is you can

28:16.800 --> 28:18.800
unclench your asshole now and do whatever you

28:18.800 --> 28:20.800
want because you're still a woman whether you're

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
performing a stereotype or not.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
So run free, Justine.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.800
Go top a cis woman.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.800
Bang a gay guy. Wear some oversized

28:28.800 --> 28:30.800
flannel. Do whatever you want.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.800
Wow, yeah, I guess

28:32.800 --> 28:34.800
that is pretty liberating. Yeah,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.800
thank god for transmedicalism, right?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.800
Oh, except not

28:38.800 --> 28:40.800
because you just destroyed transmedicalism

28:40.800 --> 28:42.800
with facts and logic, so we have no

28:42.800 --> 28:44.800
theory. We have no theory, Justine.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.800
What do we do now? How do we prove

28:46.800 --> 28:48.800
we're valid? Well, just do what every trans

28:48.800 --> 28:50.800
woman has done since the beginning of time.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.800
Go out and fuck the most brutally

28:52.800 --> 28:54.800
heterosexual man you can find and

28:54.800 --> 28:56.800
be validated and come.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.800
Oh, honey, I have and I will,

28:58.800 --> 29:00.800
but that's not gonna convince anyone but

29:00.800 --> 29:02.800
me. It's not a proof.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.800
It's not a theory. Well, maybe

29:04.800 --> 29:06.800
we don't need a theory. Maybe we

29:06.800 --> 29:08.800
don't need to prove anything.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.800
Bad things, Justine. Bad things.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.800
Well, do we have a theory about why

29:12.800 --> 29:14.800
people are gay? No. They just

29:14.800 --> 29:16.800
are. The only reason we even feel

29:16.800 --> 29:18.800
like we need a theory about trans people

29:18.800 --> 29:20.800
is that society is so unaccepting

29:20.800 --> 29:22.800
of us that it's constantly demanding

29:22.800 --> 29:24.800
we justify our own reality.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.800
Okay, so what am I supposed to tell Jackie

29:26.800 --> 29:28.800
Jackson, then? What am I supposed to tell

29:28.800 --> 29:30.800
the TERFs? That I'm a woman because

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
reasons? No. Not

29:32.800 --> 29:34.800
even because reasons. Just

29:34.800 --> 29:36.800
because you are. So it's what? A leap

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
of faith? Oh, great.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
I'm sure that's gonna convince all the rational

29:40.800 --> 29:42.800
skeptics. Justine,

29:42.800 --> 29:44.800
it makes us sound completely delusional.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.800
Well, Tiffany, delusion

29:46.800 --> 29:48.800
is what separates us from the

29:48.800 --> 29:50.800
animals. Who do you think built the pyramids

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
and the cathedrals? Clearly not people

29:52.800 --> 29:54.800
with a perfectly rational worldview.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
But what do you care anyway? Aren't you the one who thinks

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
being trans is a mental disorder? Well, I wouldn't

29:58.800 --> 30:00.800
describe it as the height of sanity,

30:00.800 --> 30:02.800
but I would prefer to think that my whole

30:02.800 --> 30:04.800
life and identity is based on something I

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
can rationally explain. Well, what are

30:06.800 --> 30:08.800
we, Tiffany? Men? Isn't the

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
single most obnoxious thing about men

30:10.800 --> 30:12.800
that they think they have to wrap up the entire

30:12.800 --> 30:14.800
world in a little rational box?

30:14.800 --> 30:16.800
Maybe the most important

30:16.800 --> 30:18.800
things in life can't be logically

30:18.800 --> 30:20.800
proved. Can you logically prove

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
that you love your own children?

30:22.800 --> 30:24.800
No. And the attempt to prove

30:24.800 --> 30:26.800
it is as degrading as it is

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
futile. Maybe gender identity

30:28.800 --> 30:30.800
is one of those things.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.800
Okay, but then how do I

30:32.800 --> 30:34.800
prove I'm more valid than Baltimore,

30:34.800 --> 30:36.800
Maryland, and the star genders,

30:36.800 --> 30:38.800
and the cat people? Well, maybe

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
we should stop getting so caught up

30:40.800 --> 30:42.800
in proving our validity to ourselves

30:42.800 --> 30:44.800
that we end up being horribly cruel

30:44.800 --> 30:46.800
to other people. What if we just accept

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
all the freaks of the world?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
At the end of the day, maybe it's just not as

30:50.800 --> 30:52.800
important to have logical proofs as it

30:52.800 --> 30:54.800
is to be empathetic and open-minded

30:54.800 --> 30:56.800
and compassionate.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.800
Kumbaya,

30:58.800 --> 31:00.800
my lord,

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
kumbaya.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:04.800 --> 31:06.800
kumbaya.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.800
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
kumbaya.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.800
Kumbaya.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.800
I have something to tell you.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.800
Here it comes.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.800
I love you.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
Okay.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.800
Well, I'm going to get going now.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.800
I have an important

31:24.800 --> 31:26.800
date tonight, drinking vodka cranberries

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
and reading YouTube comments by myself,

31:28.800 --> 31:30.800
so I'd really

31:30.800 --> 31:32.800
better go do that, but

31:32.800 --> 31:34.800
good luck with your new

31:34.800 --> 31:36.800
life as a male lesbian who fucks cats.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.800
Ugh.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.800
Oh, are you upset?

31:42.800 --> 31:44.800
Just go.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.800
I'm sorry.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.800
Ugh. I hate

31:50.800 --> 31:52.800
this bitch.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.800
But god, she's a yum-yum.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.800
Harken, children.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.800
In this vision you have witnessed

31:58.800 --> 32:00.800
mortal fools upon the screen.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.800
Fools who do not love

32:02.800 --> 32:04.800
themselves. But I,

32:04.800 --> 32:06.800
your goddess, mother, queen,

32:06.800 --> 32:08.800
messiah, I am

32:08.800 --> 32:10.800
nothing like them.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.800
For I am truth.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.800
I am light.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.800
I am in capitalism.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.800
And everything I tweet is

32:18.800 --> 32:20.800
woke. But most importantly,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.800
I am not a

32:22.800 --> 32:24.800
woke. But most importantly,

32:24.800 --> 32:26.800
I love myself.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.800
I love myself so much it makes me wet.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
It makes me cum.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.800
Praise be unto me. Hallelujah.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.800

32:34.800 --> 32:36.800

Amen.
