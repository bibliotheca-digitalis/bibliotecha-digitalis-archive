0	15720	Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.
15720	23120	My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything
23120	24600	you hate.
24600	29200	Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.
29200	34600	Human invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands
34600	37560	by a cabal of globalist elites.
37560	43440	And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization
43440	44560	as we know it.
44560	49160	I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.
49160	53320	Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.
53320	59840	Now, watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under
59840	63120	the black boots of the Third World Horde.
63120	65440	Does that thought fill you with rage?
65440	66680	Good.
66680	69280	We must be prepared to fight.
69280	76480	To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.
76480	82640	To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.
82640	85440	Make America great again.
85440	87440	Hail victory.
98240	101040	Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.
101040	116040	So, actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the
116040	122680	anitself, so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the
122680	127640	dialectical object through the sublimation of negative materiality.
128640	131640	Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.
131640	133640	Death to capitalism.
133640	135640	Hail Satan.
158640	162640	So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?
162640	164240	Well, what do you expect?
164240	169120	We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent
169120	172120	white middle class that prefers order to justice.
172120	174640	Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.
174640	176720	So, let's accept that all of that's true.
176720	177720	The game is rigged.
177720	178720	Fine.
178720	180760	Now, how do you respond to that situation?
180760	184400	Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the
184400	188400	predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?
188400	192560	Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer esthete who puts style
192560	197240	over substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary
197240	199400	Trotskyite tendencies.
199400	201400	I mean, are you even a communist?
201400	202400	No.
202400	204400	I'm not a communist.
204400	205400	Well, why not?
205400	206400	Mmmmm.
206400	208400	I like stuff.
208400	212400	I like this, and I like this, and I like this.
212400	214400	And that's why I can't be a communist.
214400	220400	Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property, right?
220400	224400	You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.
224400	227400	Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.
227400	228900	Well, you should feel bad about that.
228900	230400	Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.
230400	232400	Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.
232400	235400	Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.
235400	236400	Right.
236400	239400	Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?
240400	242400	That's what I thought.
242400	245400	You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.
245400	247400	And they're afraid of you.
247400	249400	Well, fascists are afraid of me.
249400	250400	Really?
250400	252400	Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.
252400	257400	Let's see, we've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.
257400	260400	Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.
260400	265400	Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.
265400	266400	Great.
267400	270400	Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.
270400	271400	Positives first.
271400	273400	The rose is great.
273400	274400	Love the rose.
274400	275400	Fantastic.
275400	277400	Now, the hammer and sickle.
277400	279400	We're gonna need to get rid of that.
279400	281400	I'm just wearing it ironically.
281400	282400	No, don't you start with that.
282400	285400	It makes me think of red lines and gulags, and it needs to go.
285400	287400	Well, maybe you're right.
287400	288400	Fine, I'll get rid of it.
288400	290400	See, I can think about optics.
290400	291400	What's that in your bag?
291400	292400	Oh, this?
292400	295400	Yeah, we're gonna need to do something about that too.
295400	296400	Now, hold on.
296400	298400	Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,
298400	301400	but Marx is a foundational thinker in the history of progressive politicalâ€”
301400	303400	I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.
303400	305400	I'm talking about giving him a makeover.
305400	307400	I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.
307400	309400	It's making me depressed just looking at it.
309400	310400	Red and gold?
310400	312400	What is this foreign shit?
312400	314400	Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?
314400	316400	It's un-American.
316400	317400	I don't trust it.
317400	319400	I don't like the cut of its jib.
319400	322400	So you want a Marx Engels reader wrapped in an American flag.
322400	324400	Oh, I can do you better than that.
324400	326400	Let's start with a gradient.
326400	327400	Add a grid.
327400	328400	Maybe a wave grid.
328400	330400	Let's get some shiny fonts.
330400	331400	Maybe a bust.
331400	332400	A pink bust.
332400	334400	With 3D glasses.
334400	335400	Pink glasses.
335400	337400	Maybe some palm trees.
337400	338400	Oh, yeah.
342400	343400	Or how about this?
343400	344400	Lots of brands.
344400	346400	More, more, more.
346400	347400	Oh, my God.
347400	348400	It's beautiful.
348400	349400	Okay, one more, one more.
349400	351400	A pink field.
351400	352400	Chiclet.
352400	353400	Yas, girl.
353400	354400	Yas.
354400	356400	I just realized that I actually hate you.
357400	358400	Hello, fellow whites.
358400	362400	Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a future for white children?
362400	365400	Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.
368400	369400	Effective, isn't it?
369400	371400	Well, I see your point.
371400	376400	But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,
376400	381400	if there's some way you can not do that.
382400	384400	Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?
384400	389400	I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.
396400	398400	But that means getting 30,000 people on your side,
398400	402400	which you're not going to do by tweeting death threats and communist propaganda,
402400	404400	and using words like dialectic,
404400	409400	and telling everyone to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas,
409400	413400	and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with,
413400	416400	and expecting that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives
416400	422400	to join a violent revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.
422400	424400	Well, that's an unfair association.
424400	427400	Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.
427400	429400	Has there ever been real communism?
429400	431400	Well, yes.
431400	435400	Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon,
435400	439400	a thriving though short-lived communist utopia did flourish,
439400	441400	until it was smashed by western imperialism.
441400	442400	Right.
442400	446400	But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?
446400	448400	You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.
448400	450400	That's how deep you are in pure theory.
450400	453400	And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.
453400	456400	You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.
456400	460400	You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.
460400	463400	Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs,
463400	465400	you're never accountable for the way things are going.
465400	469400	I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.
469400	471400	Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.
471400	473400	For all I know, you could be correct.
473400	476400	I'm just saying, it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.
476400	480400	Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual void,
480400	484400	where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing
484400	487400	have shifted the Overton window one inch left of fascism
487400	490400	under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.
491400	495400	Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?
497400	499400	Hey, hey, hey. You leave centrists alone.
499400	501400	Thanks, Justine.
501400	504400	Jackie, get out of here. You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.
504400	506400	I'll see you at brunch.
506400	508400	Mimosas.
508400	510400	What the hell was that?
510400	513400	Brunch? You go to brunch with these people?
513400	515400	Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.
515400	517400	Afternoon tea?
517400	522400	Does Jeeves bring around Madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?
522400	525400	No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.
525400	527400	Unbelievable.
527400	530400	You get the bullet, too. You get the goddamn bullet, too.
530400	532400	Oh, come on. Me?
532400	534400	What do you want me to do?
534400	540400	Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in eastern Cameroon?
540400	542400	I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.
542400	545400	I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle,
545400	548400	shooting at capitalists with a black beret and an eyepatch,
548400	550400	and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.
550400	554400	Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists
554400	558400	and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?
558400	560400	How is Antifa keeping me safe?
560400	565400	You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.
565400	568400	Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing,
568400	572400	infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting their recruitment,
572400	576400	and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.
576400	580400	And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long enough,
580400	582400	you're going to be at a counter-protest,
582400	584400	and the black bloc is going to save your life,
584400	586400	because you don't look like you can fight,
586400	588400	and the police certainly aren't going to save you.
588400	590400	Well, maybe so.
590400	592400	I mean, I'm the first to admit,
592400	594400	these are not Nazi-punching hands,
594400	596400	so I'm not going to get in your way.
596400	598400	But in the free marketplace of ideas,
598400	600400	and like it or not, that's what we're in,
600400	602400	I can't help but think that what you are
602400	604400	matters less than what you seem to be,
604400	606400	and black-clad thugs in masks
606400	608400	smashing things in the street
608400	609400	seems pretty scary.
609400	610400	Oh, come on!
610400	611400	You have to admit,
611400	614400	there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.
614400	616400	What about a girl in a mask?
621400	625400	I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.
625400	627400	Well, it was worth a shot.
627400	628400	Look, my point is,
628400	630400	you can't just win the war in the street.
630400	632400	You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.
632400	634400	You mean the propaganda war.
634400	635400	Shh!
635400	637400	Don't call it propaganda.
637400	639400	There could be liberals listening.
639400	640400	Look, what the left needs to get,
640400	642400	and what the centrists need to get,
642400	644400	and what only I and the fascists seem to understand,
644400	646400	is that reason doesn't matter very much.
646400	647400	Oh boy.
647400	648400	Here we go.
648400	650400	What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?
650400	652400	It's not that they don't have good reasons
652400	653400	in support of their arguments.
653400	655400	It's that they're not cool, right?
655400	657400	Social justice warriors are not cool.
657400	659400	What do you mean, they're not popular?
659400	661400	No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.
661400	663400	You can be unpopular and still cool.
663400	665400	In fact, you can be cool to be unpopular.
665400	667400	So what does it mean to be cool?
667400	670400	Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself.
670400	672400	And the leading complaint about social justice warriors
672400	674400	is that they're emotional.
674400	676400	The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online
676400	678400	are people who I'm sure are nice people,
678400	680400	but who are having a bad moment,
680400	682400	and they're caught on camera in the middle of an outburst.
682400	684400	They're out of control.
684400	685400	And that's the problem.
685400	686400	It's not cool.
686400	688400	Look, this detached, ironic,
688400	690400	pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing
690400	692400	that white men mistake for rationality
692400	694400	is really just the self-celebration
694400	696400	of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.
696400	698400	People on the left are never going to be cool
698400	700400	because anger and emotion
700400	702400	are rational responses to injustice.
702400	704400	I thought you'd say that,
704400	706400	but what you're failing to consider
706400	708400	is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.
708400	710400	And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger
710400	712400	into a glass of cool?
712400	713400	What?
713400	714400	You get...
714400	716400	ice cold.
716400	721400	ðŸŽµ
721400	723400	I'm sorry, what?
723400	725400	And that's what we on the left need to become.
725400	727400	Ice cold motherfuckers.
727400	729400	What the hell are you talking about?
729400	731400	Miles Davis.
731400	732400	Incredibly cool.
732400	734400	But pretty angry.
734400	736400	Did not take shit from white people.
736400	738400	But also, ice cold motherfucker.
738400	740400	Your plan is to win over centrists
740400	742400	by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.
742400	743400	Precisely.
743400	746400	What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.
746400	747400	This is ridiculous.
747400	750400	And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.
751400	753400	I think it's stale, mate.
753400	754400	No, it's not.
754400	756400	My queen is wide open.
756400	758400	No, it isn't.
758400	760400	Take me.
760400	761400	I'm gonna get going now.
761400	762400	Wait, where are you going?
762400	764400	I'm gonna go bash the fash.
764400	766400	Well, be careful.
766400	767400	Sure.
767400	769400	Enjoy your tea tomorrow.
771400	773400	What a goddamn lunatic.
773400	775400	I'm gonna miss her.
796400	798400	I'm gonna miss her.
827400	830400	Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?
830400	832400	They got into a fight on Skype, remember?
832400	833400	Anyway, they killed each other.
833400	834400	They're both dead.
834400	837400	They kind of fired guns off in random directions.
837400	840400	It's best not to think about it too much.
