WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.720
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

00:15.720 --> 00:23.120
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything

00:23.120 --> 00:24.600
you hate.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.200
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.600
Human invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands

00:34.600 --> 00:37.560
by a cabal of globalist elites.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.440
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization

00:43.440 --> 00:44.560
as we know it.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.160
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.320
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

00:53.320 --> 00:59.840
Now, watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under

00:59.840 --> 01:03.120
the black boots of the Third World Horde.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.440
Does that thought fill you with rage?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.680
Good.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.280
We must be prepared to fight.

01:09.280 --> 01:16.480
To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.

01:16.480 --> 01:22.640
To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.440
Make America great again.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.440
Hail victory.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.040
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

01:41.040 --> 01:56.040
So, actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the

01:56.040 --> 02:02.680
anitself, so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the

02:02.680 --> 02:07.640
dialectical object through the sublimation of negative materiality.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.640
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.640
Death to capitalism.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.640
Hail Satan.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.640
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

02:42.640 --> 02:44.240
Well, what do you expect?

02:44.240 --> 02:49.120
We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent

02:49.120 --> 02:52.120
white middle class that prefers order to justice.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.640
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.720
So, let's accept that all of that's true.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.720
The game is rigged.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
Fine.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.760
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

03:00.760 --> 03:04.400
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the

03:04.400 --> 03:08.400
predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

03:08.400 --> 03:12.560
Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer esthete who puts style

03:12.560 --> 03:17.240
over substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary

03:17.240 --> 03:19.400
Trotskyite tendencies.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.400
I mean, are you even a communist?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
No.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.400
I'm not a communist.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.400
Well, why not?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
Mmmmm.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.400
I like stuff.

03:28.400 --> 03:32.400
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
And that's why I can't be a communist.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.400
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property, right?

03:40.400 --> 03:44.400
You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.400
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.900
Well, you should feel bad about that.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.400
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.400
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.400
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Right.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.400
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
That's what I thought.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.400
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
And they're afraid of you.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.400
Really?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.400
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

04:12.400 --> 04:17.400
Let's see, we've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.400
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.400
Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.400
Great.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.400
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
Positives first.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.400
The rose is great.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
Love the rose.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
Fantastic.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.400
Now, the hammer and sickle.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.400
We're gonna need to get rid of that.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
I'm just wearing it ironically.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
No, don't you start with that.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.400
It makes me think of red lines and gulags, and it needs to go.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
Well, maybe you're right.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
See, I can think about optics.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
What's that in your bag?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
Oh, this?

04:52.400 --> 04:55.400
Yeah, we're gonna need to do something about that too.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
Now, hold on.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.400
Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,

04:58.400 --> 05:01.400
but Marx is a foundational thinker in the history of progressive politicalâ€”

05:01.400 --> 05:03.400
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.400
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.400
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
Red and gold?

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
What is this foreign shit?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.400
It's un-American.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
I don't trust it.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.400
I don't like the cut of its jib.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.400
So you want a Marx Engels reader wrapped in an American flag.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
Oh, I can do you better than that.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
Let's start with a gradient.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
Add a grid.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
Maybe a wave grid.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.400
Let's get some shiny fonts.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.400
Maybe a bust.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
A pink bust.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.400
With 3D glasses.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
Pink glasses.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.400
Maybe some palm trees.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
Oh, yeah.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Or how about this?

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
Lots of brands.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
More, more, more.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.400
Oh, my God.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
It's beautiful.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Okay, one more, one more.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.400
A pink field.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
Chiclet.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Yas, girl.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
Yas.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
I just realized that I actually hate you.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
Hello, fellow whites.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.400
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a future for white children?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.400
Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
Effective, isn't it?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
Well, I see your point.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.400
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

06:16.400 --> 06:21.400
if there's some way you can not do that.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

06:24.400 --> 06:29.400
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side,

06:38.400 --> 06:42.400
which you're not going to do by tweeting death threats and communist propaganda,

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
and using words like dialectic,

06:44.400 --> 06:49.400
and telling everyone to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas,

06:49.400 --> 06:53.400
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with,

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
and expecting that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives

06:56.400 --> 07:02.400
to join a violent revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.400
Well, that's an unfair association.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.400
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
Has there ever been real communism?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.400
Well, yes.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.400
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon,

07:15.400 --> 07:19.400
a thriving though short-lived communist utopia did flourish,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
until it was smashed by western imperialism.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
Right.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.400
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.400
That's how deep you are in pure theory.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.400
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.400
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.400
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.400
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs,

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
you're never accountable for the way things are going.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.400
I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.400
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
For all I know, you could be correct.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.400
I'm just saying, it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.400
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual void,

08:00.400 --> 08:04.400
where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing

08:04.400 --> 08:07.400
have shifted the Overton window one inch left of fascism

08:07.400 --> 08:10.400
under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.400
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.400
Hey, hey, hey. You leave centrists alone.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.400
Thanks, Justine.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.400
Jackie, get out of here. You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
I'll see you at brunch.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
Mimosas.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
What the hell was that?

08:30.400 --> 08:33.400
Brunch? You go to brunch with these people?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.400
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.400
Afternoon tea?

08:37.400 --> 08:42.400
Does Jeeves bring around Madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.400
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.400
Unbelievable.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.400
You get the bullet, too. You get the goddamn bullet, too.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
Oh, come on. Me?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
What do you want me to do?

08:54.400 --> 09:00.400
Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in eastern Cameroon?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.400
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.400
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle,

09:05.400 --> 09:08.400
shooting at capitalists with a black beret and an eyepatch,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.400
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

09:14.400 --> 09:18.400
and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.400
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

09:20.400 --> 09:25.400
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.400
Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing,

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting their recruitment,

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.400
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long enough,

09:40.400 --> 09:42.400
you're going to be at a counter-protest,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
and the black bloc is going to save your life,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
because you don't look like you can fight,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
and the police certainly aren't going to save you.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
Well, maybe so.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.400
I mean, I'm the first to admit,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.400
these are not Nazi-punching hands,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
so I'm not going to get in your way.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
But in the free marketplace of ideas,

09:58.400 --> 10:00.400
and like it or not, that's what we're in,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
I can't help but think that what you are

10:02.400 --> 10:04.400
matters less than what you seem to be,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
and black-clad thugs in masks

10:06.400 --> 10:08.400
smashing things in the street

10:08.400 --> 10:09.400
seems pretty scary.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
Oh, come on!

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
You have to admit,

10:11.400 --> 10:14.400
there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
What about a girl in a mask?

10:21.400 --> 10:25.400
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.400
Well, it was worth a shot.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Look, my point is,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
you can't just win the war in the street.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
You mean the propaganda war.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
Shh!

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
Don't call it propaganda.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
There could be liberals listening.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
Look, what the left needs to get,

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
and what the centrists need to get,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
and what only I and the fascists seem to understand,

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
is that reason doesn't matter very much.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
Oh boy.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
Here we go.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
It's not that they don't have good reasons

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
in support of their arguments.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.400
It's that they're not cool, right?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
Social justice warriors are not cool.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
What do you mean, they're not popular?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
You can be unpopular and still cool.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
In fact, you can be cool to be unpopular.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.400
So what does it mean to be cool?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.400
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.400
And the leading complaint about social justice warriors

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
is that they're emotional.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
are people who I'm sure are nice people,

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
but who are having a bad moment,

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
and they're caught on camera in the middle of an outburst.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
They're out of control.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
And that's the problem.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
It's not cool.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
Look, this detached, ironic,

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
that white men mistake for rationality

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
is really just the self-celebration

11:34.400 --> 11:36.400
of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
People on the left are never going to be cool

11:38.400 --> 11:40.400
because anger and emotion

11:40.400 --> 11:42.400
are rational responses to injustice.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
I thought you'd say that,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
but what you're failing to consider

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
into a glass of cool?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
What?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
You get...

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
ice cold.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.400
ðŸŽµ

12:01.400 --> 12:03.400
I'm sorry, what?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
And that's what we on the left need to become.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.400
Ice cold motherfuckers.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
What the hell are you talking about?

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
Miles Davis.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
Incredibly cool.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
But pretty angry.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
Did not take shit from white people.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
But also, ice cold motherfucker.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
Your plan is to win over centrists

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.400
Precisely.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.400
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
This is ridiculous.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.400
And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
I think it's stale, mate.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.400
No, it's not.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
My queen is wide open.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.400
No, it isn't.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
Take me.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
I'm gonna get going now.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
Wait, where are you going?

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
I'm gonna go bash the fash.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
Well, be careful.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.400
Sure.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.400
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
What a goddamn lunatic.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.400
I'm gonna miss her.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.400
I'm gonna miss her.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.400
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

13:50.400 --> 13:52.400
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

13:52.400 --> 13:53.400
Anyway, they killed each other.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.400
They're both dead.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.400
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.400
It's best not to think about it too much.
