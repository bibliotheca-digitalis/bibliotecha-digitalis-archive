1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,120
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,600
you hate.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,200
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Human invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,560
by a cabal of globalist elites.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,440
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,560
as we know it.

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,160
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,320
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,840
Now, watch as those same wives are violated, those same children dashed to pieces under

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,120
the black boots of the Third World Horde.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
Does that thought fill you with rage?

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,680
Good.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,280
We must be prepared to fight.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,480
To fight for our children, and for our nation, and for our history, and for our culture.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,640
To fight for the homeland we've always known, and the people we've always loved.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,440
Make America great again.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
Hail victory.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:56,040
So, actually, according to Hegel, the for itself can only be actualized through the

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,680
anitself, so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands the transcendence of the

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,640
dialectical object through the sublimation of negative materiality.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists.

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Death to capitalism.

26
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Hail Satan.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,640
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Well, what do you expect?

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,120
We have the politicians against us, a media run by giant corporations, and a complacent

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,120
white middle class that prefers order to justice.

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
So, let's accept that all of that's true.

33
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
The game is rigged.

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Fine.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,760
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,400
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all and then blame the system when the

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
predictable happens, or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
Look, I don't really need optics advice from a bougie queer esthete who puts style

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,240
over substance and thinks that shining a pink light on everything can cover up her counter-revolutionary

40
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Trotskyite tendencies.

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I mean, are you even a communist?

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
No.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm not a communist.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Well, why not?

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Mmmmm.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
I like stuff.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
And that's why I can't be a communist.

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes between private property and personal property, right?

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
You're allowed to own possessions, you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

52
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,900
Well, you should feel bad about that.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Right.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
That's what I thought.

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
And they're afraid of you.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Really?

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Let's see, we've got guillotines, Soviet memes, liberals get the bullet too.

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks you're some kind of scary terrorist.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Okay, Jesus, let's hear your mind-blowing revelations about respectability politics.

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Great.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Positives first.

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
The rose is great.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Love the rose.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Fantastic.

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Now, the hammer and sickle.

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
We're gonna need to get rid of that.

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm just wearing it ironically.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
No, don't you start with that.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
It makes me think of red lines and gulags, and it needs to go.

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Well, maybe you're right.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
See, I can think about optics.

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
What's that in your bag?

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh, this?

83
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Yeah, we're gonna need to do something about that too.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Now, hold on.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
but Marx is a foundational thinker in the history of progressive politicalâ€”

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

89
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Red and gold?

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
What is this foreign shit?

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
It's un-American.

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I don't trust it.

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I don't like the cut of its jib.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
So you want a Marx Engels reader wrapped in an American flag.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Oh, I can do you better than that.

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Let's start with a gradient.

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Add a grid.

101
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Maybe a wave grid.

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Let's get some shiny fonts.

103
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Maybe a bust.

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
A pink bust.

105
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
With 3D glasses.

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Pink glasses.

107
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Maybe some palm trees.

108
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Or how about this?

110
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Lots of brands.

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
More, more, more.

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
It's beautiful.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Okay, one more, one more.

115
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
A pink field.

116
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Chiclet.

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Yas, girl.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Yas.

119
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I just realized that I actually hate you.

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Hello, fellow whites.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a future for white children?

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Effective, isn't it?

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Well, I see your point.

125
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,400
if there's some way you can not do that.

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side,

130
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
which you're not going to do by tweeting death threats and communist propaganda,

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
and using words like dialectic,

132
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,400
and telling everyone to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas,

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,400
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with,

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
and expecting that people are going to want to leave their jobs and comfortable lives

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,400
to join a violent revolution to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, that's an unfair association.

137
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

138
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Has there ever been real communism?

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, yes.

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon,

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,400
a thriving though short-lived communist utopia did flourish,

142
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
until it was smashed by western imperialism.

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Right.

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.

146
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
That's how deep you are in pure theory.

147
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

150
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs,

151
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
you're never accountable for the way things are going.

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm not saying theory is everything, only that there's no praxis without theory.

153
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
For all I know, you could be correct.

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm just saying, it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.

156
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual void,

157
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
have shifted the Overton window one inch left of fascism

159
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Hey, hey, hey. You leave centrists alone.

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Thanks, Justine.

163
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Jackie, get out of here. You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I'll see you at brunch.

165
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Mimosas.

166
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
What the hell was that?

167
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Brunch? You go to brunch with these people?

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Afternoon tea?

170
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Does Jeeves bring around Madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?

171
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Unbelievable.

173
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
You get the bullet, too. You get the goddamn bullet, too.

174
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Oh, come on. Me?

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
What do you want me to do?

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries in eastern Cameroon?

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

178
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle,

179
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
shooting at capitalists with a black beret and an eyepatch,

180
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.

181
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
and not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep you safe?

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

184
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,400
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing,

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting their recruitment,

187
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.

188
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long enough,

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
you're going to be at a counter-protest,

190
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
and the black bloc is going to save your life,

191
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
because you don't look like you can fight,

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
and the police certainly aren't going to save you.

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, maybe so.

194
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I mean, I'm the first to admit,

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
these are not Nazi-punching hands,

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
so I'm not going to get in your way.

197
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
But in the free marketplace of ideas,

198
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
and like it or not, that's what we're in,

199
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I can't help but think that what you are

200
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
matters less than what you seem to be,

201
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
and black-clad thugs in masks

202
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
smashing things in the street

203
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
seems pretty scary.

204
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh, come on!

205
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
You have to admit,

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

207
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
What about a girl in a mask?

208
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

209
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Well, it was worth a shot.

210
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Look, my point is,

211
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
you can't just win the war in the street.

212
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

213
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
You mean the propaganda war.

214
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Shh!

215
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Don't call it propaganda.

216
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
There could be liberals listening.

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Look, what the left needs to get,

218
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
and what the centrists need to get,

219
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
and what only I and the fascists seem to understand,

220
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
is that reason doesn't matter very much.

221
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Oh boy.

222
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Here we go.

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
It's not that they don't have good reasons

225
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
in support of their arguments.

226
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
It's that they're not cool, right?

227
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Social justice warriors are not cool.

228
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
What do you mean, they're not popular?

229
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.

230
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
You can be unpopular and still cool.

231
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
In fact, you can be cool to be unpopular.

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
So what does it mean to be cool?

233
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself.

234
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
And the leading complaint about social justice warriors

235
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
is that they're emotional.

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
are people who I'm sure are nice people,

238
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
but who are having a bad moment,

239
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
and they're caught on camera in the middle of an outburst.

240
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
They're out of control.

241
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
And that's the problem.

242
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
It's not cool.

243
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Look, this detached, ironic,

244
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing

245
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
that white men mistake for rationality

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
is really just the self-celebration

247
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

248
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
People on the left are never going to be cool

249
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
because anger and emotion

250
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
are rational responses to injustice.

251
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I thought you'd say that,

252
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
but what you're failing to consider

253
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.

254
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger

255
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
into a glass of cool?

256
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
What?

257
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
You get...

258
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
ice cold.

259
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,400
ðŸŽµ

260
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm sorry, what?

261
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
And that's what we on the left need to become.

262
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Ice cold motherfuckers.

263
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
What the hell are you talking about?

264
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Miles Davis.

265
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Incredibly cool.

266
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
But pretty angry.

267
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Did not take shit from white people.

268
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
But also, ice cold motherfucker.

269
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Your plan is to win over centrists

270
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

271
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Precisely.

272
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

273
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
This is ridiculous.

274
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.

275
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I think it's stale, mate.

276
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
No, it's not.

277
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
My queen is wide open.

278
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
No, it isn't.

279
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Take me.

280
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm gonna get going now.

281
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Wait, where are you going?

282
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm gonna go bash the fash.

283
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Well, be careful.

284
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Sure.

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

286
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What a goddamn lunatic.

287
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm gonna miss her.

288
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm gonna miss her.

289
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

290
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

291
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Anyway, they killed each other.

292
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
They're both dead.

293
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

294
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
It's best not to think about it too much.
