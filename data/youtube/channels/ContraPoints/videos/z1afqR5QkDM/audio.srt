00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,880
Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,680
schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,600
Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,560
about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,120
This week, we'll be talking about colors.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
Colors!

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,800
What the fuck are they?

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,280
In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
It's delicious!

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,520
Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
radiation.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,440
But what about the shadow illusion?

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,600
Same wavelengths, different colors.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,280
Some people say I'm a man dressed as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be a

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,080
man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,440
Explain that, Professor Butler.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Illusion.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,760
What matters more?

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,240
The way things are, or the way things look?

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,520
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um...

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
It's too early for this.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Today my guests are, um...

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,480
Well, who are you people?

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,240
I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbain, Associate Professor of Women's Studies and author of many, many

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
books.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,480
Oh, yes, and, uh, well you look familiar.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Who are you?

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic...

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Um...

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Well, here's a good one.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
What do you think, Annabelle?

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,080
Well, Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
of speech.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,080
For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
costume wig.

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,280
Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,080
pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
But perhaps you disagree, sir.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
That's a human rights violation!

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I'll smash your fucking face.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,080
And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,080
smokescreen for male violence against women.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
it's becoming mandatory...

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Security!

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Have this cat removed!

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,080
The centers are being silenced, and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda,

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,080
taking away women's rights, invading women's spaces, depriving us of what feminism has

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
worked so hard to...

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,080
I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Gender's just like color.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Some people see yellow, some people see blue.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
It's all a matter of opinion.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Or is it?

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
It's not.

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Let's hear the real tea.

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
TABBY

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Tabby.

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Sweetie baby.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Princess.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
I feel ridiculous in this dress.

67
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
I think I'm gonna take the dress off.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Well don't do that.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm trying to help you out, girl.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm gonna take it off.

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Well don't leave.

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
You can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.

75
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
I'm gonna go behind the curtain.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I like looking at naked people.

77
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Why do you always hit on me?

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
I thought you were into men.

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
Well I swing both ways.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I like boy dick and girl dick.

81
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
That's not how that works.

82
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
I hate that.

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
The heart wants what it wants.

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Why did you invite me over here anyway?

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report, and girl.

86
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Girl.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,080
You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.

88
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
No, morally wrong.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
What does that even mean?

91
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
It was much worse than morally wrong.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
It was aesthetically wrong.

93
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
It was unfeminine.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
This is all you ever say to me.

95
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
It's bad optics.

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
It's bad aesthetics.

97
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Well does reality matter at all to you?

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Cause the reality is I am a woman.

99
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one,

100
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
but the way things look isn't all that matters.

101
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Tabby, this is politics.

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?

103
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Reality plays no role in politics.

104
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Politics is aesthetics.

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Politics is aesthetics?

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
That's literally what fascism is.

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Have you even read Benjamin?

108
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.

109
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
The military parades, the pageantry,

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,080
and communism responds by politicizing art.

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
This is what I can't stand about communists.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
You want to turn art into propaganda.

113
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Well art is already ideology.

114
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Ah, look, instead of ruining art,

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism

116
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
with pageantry of our own.

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
And you know who's gonna make that happen?

118
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Who?

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Well-funded trans women.

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Patreon's in the description.

121
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Ew. Stop that.

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
What?

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics.

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Is that so wrong?

126
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
You're so bougie.

127
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.

128
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Revolutionary philosophers.

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Look, the point I'm trying to make is that the world we live in

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
is not a philosophical world.

132
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Think about Instagram.

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?

135
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
No one sees that.

136
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
They only see the show you're putting on.

137
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay, but life is not a show.

138
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Mmm, politics is a show.

139
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Look around you, Tabby.

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Try to understand what's happening to the world.

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,080
The president of the United States is a reality TV star.

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle,

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
and it's important to know which you're in.

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
It's Rome.

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,080
And your problem is you think you're in the forum,

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
when you're really in the circus.

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.

150
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Now you're against reason too?

151
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm not against reason.

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.

153
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
If you're a man.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
And what if you're a woman?

155
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Oh, don't be a woman.

156
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
That's not a good idea.

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Ow.

158
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Do you remember that debate between Blair White and that YouTuber with the pink wig?

159
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
What was her name?

160
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I don't know.

161
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
She was relevant back in 2017.

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Anyway, this was before she transitioned,

163
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
and in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes,

164
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
and the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera.

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
I vaguely remember.

166
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad,

168
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
it was embarrassing to watch.

169
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Not really.

170
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I mean, she was right.

171
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
And her arguments were better.

172
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Ahaha!

173
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Ah, Tabby.

174
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Arguments don't matter.

176
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
How pretty you are matters.

177
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Is this really where you're going with this?

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,

179
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,080
sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans girl black pill.

180
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Oh boy.

181
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
If you're a trans woman in the public eye,

182
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
what matters is one thing and one thing only.

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
And it's always been the thing that matters.

184
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
What?

185
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
The realness.

186
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Verisimilitude.

187
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
You have to look like a fucking woman.

188
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
There it is.

189
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
There it is is right.

190
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,080
We don't say it in public, but we all know it, and we all feel it.

191
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
What does it even mean to look like a woman?

192
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.

193
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm trying to have a real conversation here.

194
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
We all know what it means.

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't know what it means.

196
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Women have a lot of different looks.

197
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,080
There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women.

198
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,080
What is society's opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?

199
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?

200
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
The dress is the last of my concerns.

201
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
I mean, where do I even start with this?

202
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You're wearing combat boots.

203
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
You cannot be wearing combat boots.

204
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Why not?

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
A lot of cis women wear them.

206
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Cis women?

207
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?

208
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
Fully clockable.

209
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,080
So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women?

210
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Yes, do not under any circumstances imitate cis women.

211
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
They have no idea what they're doing.

212
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?

213
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Das ewigweibliche.

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
The archetype of the eternal feminine.

215
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
And where does that come from?

216
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Poets.

217
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Teenage gay boys on Instagram.

218
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood.

219
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
That's insanity.

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Is it?

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Tabby, look at my face.

222
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Look at this highlight.

223
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Does that look like the product of insanity to you?

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I mean, yeah, kind of.

225
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Love?

226
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?

227
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Good banter.

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Well done.

229
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
But trans women have to overdo it.

230
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,080
You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.

231
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.

232
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
You need to smile, even at people who hate you.

233
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.

234
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,080
You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.

235
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Your hands are not tools.

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
They're ornaments at the ends of your arms.

237
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.

238
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Literally a man's idea of a woman.

239
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Well, men have the power, men make the rules,

240
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,080
and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood,

241
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,080
so you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.

242
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,080
I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.

243
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Not stereotypes.

244
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Performances.

245
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?

246
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Gender is performance.

247
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,080
We're all born naked, and the rest is literally drag.

248
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Womanhood is not what you are, it's what you do.

249
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,080
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.

250
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,080
So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.

251
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.

252
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.

253
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I mean performance in the sense of everything you do.

254
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,080
The way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.

255
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,080
An authentic performance is just a habitual performance, and nothing more than that.

256
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,080
So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?

257
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,080
I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?

258
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.

259
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
You fake it till you make it.

260
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,080
So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.

261
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
That's what any woman is.

262
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
What about gender non-conforming cis women?

263
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
They're not doing womanhood in that way.

264
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.

265
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,080
They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.

266
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
You don't want to end up like that, do you?

267
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,

268
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,080
talks like a woman, takes female hormones, is gendered female by other people,

269
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,

270
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,080
that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?

271
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Yep.

272
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
That's absurd.

273
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
But it's absurd because the example is absurd.

274
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
No cis man would do that.

275
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
It's like asking, is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?

276
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Like, yeah, pretty much.

277
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
See, this is a philosophy at its worst.

278
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Pointless speculative fiction.

279
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,

280
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
which is you getting rid of those combat boots.

281
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I thought we were talking about philosophy.

282
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
No, we're talking about shoes.

283
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?

284
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,080
You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.

285
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,080
The left will abide a regal queer.

286
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.

287
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,

288
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,080
then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?

289
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
What matters is that we identify as women.

290
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,080
We can express that identity in different ways,

291
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,080
but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.

292
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.

293
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless.

294
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,080
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,

295
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,080
then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.

296
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,080
Because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.

297
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,080
That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.

298
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl. I'm trying to talk about what's really true.

299
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I didn't say it was insensitive. I said it was unfair.

300
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality

301
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,080
that implies a potential to live your inner truth.

302
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,080
No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter. It's just a troll example.

303
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,080
True. But even if they were sincere, there would still be no reality to it

304
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
because helicopter is not an actual social role.

305
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,

306
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080
but you have to work to get there, and ultimately society has to let you.

307
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
What do you mean?

308
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,

309
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,080
but if no one recognizes me as a doctor, then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?

310
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,080
But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.

311
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
All it takes is being misgendered.

312
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,080
It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?

313
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you sir?

314
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Isn't it because, in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?

315
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,080
That's ridiculous. I am a woman. That's my reality.

316
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.

317
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I know you're a woman. I'm just saying that in that one moment,

318
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,080
you effectively had your gender canceled.

319
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.

320
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.

321
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
There's no reasoning your way into it.

322
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,080
But don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman. I smash.

323
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,080
I know you do. And it's a bad look.

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.

354
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,

355
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
but I can be a first-rate Tabby.

356
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson

357
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
about the importance of being yourself.

358
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Shut up!

359
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?

360
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I know I'm not pretty.

361
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
And I know you think you're too good for me because you mostly pass.

362
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.

363
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,080
People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry, and that's weird.

364
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,080
But I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you.

365
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Because I'm not like anyone but myself.

366
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
And because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us.

367
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
And I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow and deep voices

368
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
that girls, even other trans women, make fun of.

369
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
And when in the history of the world

370
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,080
has anyone but me ever stood up for them?

371
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
That's why everyone knows who Tabby is.

372
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?

373
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.

374
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
But so what?

375
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
So male-to-anime Twitter stands you, big deal.

376
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
You're mad, aren't you?

377
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I'll get over it in a few weeks.

378
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Look, you're right, you have to be yourself.

379
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.

380
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,080
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,

381
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
then wear them well and make it work.

382
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.

383
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Sometimes you have to become yourself.

384
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,080
And for you, I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.

385
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
I mean with the Nazis it's one thing,

386
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.

387
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,080
I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else were willing to stick up for us.

388
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Your delicate notion of femininity is a product of the privilege

389
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
you share with a lot of thin, white, cis feminists.

390
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Wow, it must be so hard for you out on the streets as a fat woman of color.

391
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Shut up.

392
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm just saying, don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.

393
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,080
You could have what I have, you just have to work for it

394
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.

395
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
You were raised a white boy.

396
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.

397
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,080
And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,

398
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
but you still stand on a lot of privilege.

399
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
I look at all the photos of trans women who are murdered in this country

400
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
and they don't look like you or me.

401
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Why don't you use your privilege and use your education

402
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
to actually do some good in the world

403
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
instead of this elective revolutionary LARPing.

404
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.

405
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.

406
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.

407
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
You don't win friends and allies with a bat.

408
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
They're just using you.

409
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Well, who do you think benefits and who do you think gets hurt

410
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
when you go out into the world and represent trans women as masculine and violent?

411
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Who do you think benefits when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?

412
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
I guess we can't win, can we?

413
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,080
You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?

414
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Yeah, okay.

415
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Forget about the disrespect.

416
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Facts don't care about your feelings.

417
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,080
It turns out that every chromosome, every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body

418
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,080
is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.

419
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
You don't know what you're talking about.

420
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
You're not educated on genetics.

421
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Were you supposed to discuss the genetics or not?

422
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
What are your genetics?

423
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,080
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

424
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.

425
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,080
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

426
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,080
So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,

427
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community, which is so frustrating.

428
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

429
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Damage controlling.

430
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
So frustrating.

431
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

432
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Facts don't care about your feelings.

433
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
So frustrating.

434
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

435
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.

436
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,080
If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex and then talk about

437
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,080
you're a very feminine, biological man and you've had surgeries to prove it,

438
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
then I think that we can talk about what is the appropriate pronoun to use.

439
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
My problem is the...

440
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Tabby, I don't want to fight with you.

441
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,080
We're surviving in this shit world together and you'll always be my sister.

442
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Well, I'm glad.

443
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
I love you.

444
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
What?

445
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Love.

446
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I was in love once.

447
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati, bent over a pool table.

448
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
The year was 1985.

449
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,080
And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey hits my nostrils at just the right moment,

450
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth against my cheek.

451
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

452
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Now I'm here with my friends

453
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Like it was on my plan

454
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
If tonight ain't the end

455
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Then I'm going to dance

456
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
While the lasers are high

457
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
And ambitions are low

458
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
As we reach for the sky

459
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
This is all that we know

460
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Thanks for watching!
