0	6800	In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.
6800	11880	Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary
11880	18680	schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.
18680	23600	Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk
23600	27560	about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
27560	31120	This week, we'll be talking about colors.
31120	32560	Colors!
32560	33800	What the fuck are they?
33800	37280	In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.
37280	41920	Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.
41920	42920	It's delicious!
42920	47520	Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic
47520	48520	radiation.
48520	50440	But what about the shadow illusion?
50440	52600	Same wavelengths, different colors.
52600	57280	Some people say I'm a man dressed as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be a
57280	60080	man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.
60080	62440	Explain that, Professor Butler.
62440	63600	Illusion.
63600	64760	What matters more?
64760	67240	The way things are, or the way things look?
67240	70520	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
82520	87240	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um...
88240	90000	It's too early for this.
90000	92000	Today my guests are, um...
96000	98480	Well, who are you people?
98480	105240	I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbain, Associate Professor of Women's Studies and author of many, many
105240	106240	books.
106240	111760	Most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.
111760	116480	Oh, yes, and, uh, well you look familiar.
116480	118480	Who are you?
126480	130480	Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic...
131480	132480	Um...
132480	133480	Well, here's a good one.
133480	137480	Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?
137480	139480	What do you think, Annabelle?
139480	144080	Well, Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom
144080	145080	of speech.
145080	151080	For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of
151080	152080	costume wig.
152080	157280	Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that
157280	161080	pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.
161080	164080	But perhaps you disagree, sir.
166080	167080	That's a human rights violation!
167080	169080	I'll smash your fucking face.
170080	175080	And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a
175080	178080	smokescreen for male violence against women.
178080	181080	And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,
181080	182080	it's becoming mandatory...
182080	183080	Security!
183080	184080	Have this cat removed!
184080	189080	The centers are being silenced, and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda,
189080	193080	taking away women's rights, invading women's spaces, depriving us of what feminism has
193080	194080	worked so hard to...
195080	199080	I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.
199080	201080	Gender's just like color.
201080	203080	Some people see yellow, some people see blue.
203080	205080	It's all a matter of opinion.
205080	206080	Or is it?
206080	207080	It's not.
207080	209080	Let's hear the real tea.
210080	211080	TABBY
223080	224080	Tabby.
224080	226080	Sweetie baby.
226080	227080	Princess.
227080	229080	I feel ridiculous in this dress.
229080	233080	Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.
233080	235080	I think I'm gonna take the dress off.
235080	236080	Well don't do that.
236080	238080	I'm trying to help you out, girl.
238080	241080	If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.
241080	243080	I'm gonna take it off.
243080	244080	Well don't leave.
244080	246080	You can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.
246080	248080	I'm gonna go behind the curtain.
250080	252080	I like looking at naked people.
253080	254080	Why do you always hit on me?
254080	255080	I thought you were into men.
255080	257080	Well I swing both ways.
257080	259080	I like boy dick and girl dick.
259080	261080	That's not how that works.
261080	262080	I hate that.
262080	263080	The heart wants what it wants.
263080	265080	Why did you invite me over here anyway?
265080	268080	I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report, and girl.
268080	269080	Girl.
269080	273080	You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.
273080	276080	You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?
276080	278080	No, morally wrong.
278080	279080	What does that even mean?
279080	281080	It was much worse than morally wrong.
281080	282080	It was aesthetically wrong.
282080	284080	It was unfeminine.
284080	285080	This is all you ever say to me.
285080	286080	It's bad optics.
286080	287080	It's bad aesthetics.
287080	289080	Well does reality matter at all to you?
289080	291080	Cause the reality is I am a woman.
291080	293080	And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one,
293080	295080	but the way things look isn't all that matters.
295080	297080	Tabby, this is politics.
297080	299080	Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?
299080	302080	Reality plays no role in politics.
302080	304080	Politics is aesthetics.
304080	306080	Politics is aesthetics?
306080	308080	That's literally what fascism is.
308080	310080	Have you even read Benjamin?
310080	314080	Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.
314080	316080	The military parades, the pageantry,
316080	319080	and communism responds by politicizing art.
319080	321080	This is what I can't stand about communists.
321080	323080	You want to turn art into propaganda.
323080	325080	Well art is already ideology.
325080	327080	Ah, look, instead of ruining art,
327080	329080	why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism
329080	332080	with pageantry of our own.
332080	334080	And you know who's gonna make that happen?
334080	335080	Who?
335080	337080	Well-funded trans women.
337080	339080	Patreon's in the description.
339080	340080	Ew. Stop that.
340080	341080	What?
341080	343080	I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community
343080	347080	by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics.
347080	348080	Is that so wrong?
348080	350080	You're so bougie.
350080	352080	I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.
352080	354080	Revolutionary philosophers.
354080	356080	Whatever you need to tell yourself.
356080	359080	Look, the point I'm trying to make is that the world we live in
359080	361080	is not a philosophical world.
361080	362080	Think about Instagram.
362080	365080	It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.
365080	368080	If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?
368080	369080	No one sees that.
369080	371080	They only see the show you're putting on.
371080	373080	Okay, but life is not a show.
373080	374080	Mmm, politics is a show.
374080	376080	Look around you, Tabby.
376080	378080	Try to understand what's happening to the world.
378080	381080	The president of the United States is a reality TV star.
381080	384080	The 21st century is an aesthetic century.
384080	388080	In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle,
388080	390080	and it's important to know which you're in.
390080	393080	Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.
393080	394080	It's Rome.
394080	397080	And your problem is you think you're in the forum,
397080	399080	when you're really in the circus.
399080	401080	I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.
401080	403080	Now you're against reason too?
403080	405080	I'm not against reason.
405080	407080	Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.
407080	408080	If you're a man.
408080	409080	And what if you're a woman?
409080	411080	Oh, don't be a woman.
411080	412080	That's not a good idea.
412080	413080	Ow.
413080	416080	Do you remember that debate between Blair White and that YouTuber with the pink wig?
416080	418080	What was her name?
418080	419080	I don't know.
419080	421080	She was relevant back in 2017.
421080	423080	Anyway, this was before she transitioned,
423080	426080	and in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes,
426080	430080	and the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera.
430080	432080	I vaguely remember.
432080	434080	I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.
434080	436080	Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad,
436080	438080	it was embarrassing to watch.
438080	439080	Not really.
439080	440080	I mean, she was right.
440080	442080	And her arguments were better.
442080	443080	Ahaha!
443080	445080	Ah, Tabby.
445080	448080	Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.
448080	450080	Arguments don't matter.
450080	452080	How pretty you are matters.
452080	454080	Is this really where you're going with this?
454080	456080	Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,
456080	459080	sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans girl black pill.
459080	460080	Oh boy.
460080	462080	If you're a trans woman in the public eye,
462080	464080	what matters is one thing and one thing only.
464080	466080	And it's always been the thing that matters.
466080	467080	What?
467080	469080	The realness.
469080	471080	Verisimilitude.
471080	473080	You have to look like a fucking woman.
473080	474080	There it is.
474080	475080	There it is is right.
475080	478080	We don't say it in public, but we all know it, and we all feel it.
478080	480080	What does it even mean to look like a woman?
480080	482080	Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.
482080	484080	I'm trying to have a real conversation here.
484080	485080	We all know what it means.
485080	487080	I don't know what it means.
487080	489080	Women have a lot of different looks.
489080	493080	There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women.
493080	497080	What is society's opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?
497080	499080	Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?
499080	501080	The dress is the last of my concerns.
501080	503080	I mean, where do I even start with this?
503080	505080	You're wearing combat boots.
505080	507080	You cannot be wearing combat boots.
507080	508080	Why not?
508080	509080	A lot of cis women wear them.
509080	510080	Cis women?
510080	512080	Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?
512080	513080	Fully clockable.
513080	516080	So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women?
516080	519080	Yes, do not under any circumstances imitate cis women.
519080	521080	They have no idea what they're doing.
521080	524080	Where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?
524080	526080	Das ewigweibliche.
526080	528080	The archetype of the eternal feminine.
528080	530080	And where does that come from?
530080	532080	Poets.
532080	534080	Teenage gay boys on Instagram.
534080	537080	The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood.
537080	538080	That's insanity.
538080	539080	Is it?
539080	541080	Tabby, look at my face.
541080	543080	Look at this highlight.
543080	546080	Does that look like the product of insanity to you?
546080	548080	I mean, yeah, kind of.
548080	549080	Love?
549080	551080	Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?
551080	552080	Good banter.
552080	553080	Well done.
553080	555080	But trans women have to overdo it.
555080	559080	You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.
559080	562080	You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.
562080	565080	You need to smile, even at people who hate you.
565080	567080	Eliminate every aggressive impulse.
567080	571080	You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.
571080	574080	Your hands are not tools.
574080	577080	They're ornaments at the ends of your arms.
577080	580080	So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.
580080	582080	Literally a man's idea of a woman.
582080	585080	Well, men have the power, men make the rules,
585080	588080	and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood,
588080	591080	so you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.
591080	596080	I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.
596080	597080	Not stereotypes.
597080	598080	Performances.
598080	601080	You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?
601080	603080	Gender is performance.
603080	606080	We're all born naked, and the rest is literally drag.
606080	609080	Womanhood is not what you are, it's what you do.
609080	612080	And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.
612080	616080	So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.
616080	618080	Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.
618080	622080	I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.
622080	625080	I mean performance in the sense of everything you do.
625080	628080	The way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.
628080	633080	An authentic performance is just a habitual performance, and nothing more than that.
633080	637080	So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?
637080	641080	I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?
641080	643080	You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.
643080	645080	You fake it till you make it.
645080	648080	So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.
648080	649080	That's what any woman is.
649080	652080	What about gender non-conforming cis women?
652080	654080	They're not doing womanhood in that way.
654080	656080	Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.
656080	660080	They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.
660080	662080	You don't want to end up like that, do you?
662080	665080	And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,
665080	669080	talks like a woman, takes female hormones, is gendered female by other people,
669080	672080	and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,
672080	675080	that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?
675080	676080	Yep.
676080	677080	That's absurd.
677080	680080	But it's absurd because the example is absurd.
680080	682080	No cis man would do that.
682080	685080	It's like asking, is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?
685080	687080	Like, yeah, pretty much.
687080	689080	See, this is a philosophy at its worst.
689080	691080	Pointless speculative fiction.
691080	693080	And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,
693080	696080	which is you getting rid of those combat boots.
696080	698080	I thought we were talking about philosophy.
698080	700080	No, we're talking about shoes.
700080	702080	Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?
702080	706080	You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.
706080	710080	The left will abide a regal queer.
711080	715080	Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.
715080	717080	If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,
717080	720080	then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?
720080	722080	What matters is that we identify as women.
722080	725080	We can express that identity in different ways,
725080	729080	but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.
729080	732080	But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.
732080	736080	Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless.
736080	739080	If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,
739080	742080	then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.
742080	746080	Because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.
746080	749080	That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.
749080	753080	Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl. I'm trying to talk about what's really true.
753080	756080	I didn't say it was insensitive. I said it was unfair.
756080	760080	Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality
760080	763080	that implies a potential to live your inner truth.
763080	767080	No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter. It's just a troll example.
767080	772080	True. But even if they were sincere, there would still be no reality to it
772080	775080	because helicopter is not an actual social role.
775080	778080	Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,
778080	782080	but you have to work to get there, and ultimately society has to let you.
782080	783080	What do you mean?
783080	787080	I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,
787080	792080	but if no one recognizes me as a doctor, then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?
792080	795080	But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.
795080	797080	All it takes is being misgendered.
797080	800080	It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?
800080	803080	Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you sir?
803080	807080	Isn't it because, in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?
807080	810080	That's ridiculous. I am a woman. That's my reality.
810080	812080	It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.
812080	815080	I know you're a woman. I'm just saying that in that one moment,
815080	818080	you effectively had your gender canceled.
818080	822080	Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.
822080	824080	Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.
824080	826080	There's no reasoning your way into it.
826080	830080	But don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman. I smash.
830080	833080	I know you do. And it's a bad look.
833080	835080	Is this about the shoes again?
835080	837080	Here, put these on.
837080	839080	Absolutely not. I'm not wearing those.
839080	841080	Yes, you are, bitch.
841080	842080	Nope.
842080	847080	If you put these on, I'll, um, scratch you behind the ears later.
847080	849080	Okay, fine.
849080	851080	Now walk.
851080	853080	Ugh.
853080	871080	♪
871080	873080	That was the worst thing I've ever seen.
873080	875080	Well, you're the one who made me do it.
875080	877080	Look, don't stomp around like that.
877080	879080	Keep your shoulders back and steady.
879080	881080	All the movement comes from your hips.
881080	883080	And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.
883080	885080	Here, I'll show you.
885080	910080	♪
910080	912080	Your turn. Do it right.
912080	915080	The category is...
915080	917080	Cat Girls.
917080	933080	♪
933080	936080	Yes, bitch! That was flawless. It was iconic.
936080	939080	I'm living for this. I'm loving this for you.
939080	941080	You're doing so good for yourself.
941080	943080	Ugh, I'm never doing that again.
943080	945080	Why not? Because it's not who I am.
945080	948080	All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.
948080	950080	Well, that's not what aesthetics is.
950080	952080	Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.
952080	954080	And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,
954080	956080	but I can be a first-rate Tabby.
956080	959080	Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson
959080	961080	about the importance of being yourself.
961080	962080	Shut up!
962080	964080	Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?
964080	966080	I know I'm not pretty.
966080	968080	And I know you think you're too good for me because you mostly pass.
968080	971080	And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.
971080	974080	People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry, and that's weird.
974080	977080	But I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you.
977080	979080	Because I'm not like anyone but myself.
979080	982080	And because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us.
982080	985080	And I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow and deep voices
985080	987080	that girls, even other trans women, make fun of.
987080	989080	And when in the history of the world
989080	992080	has anyone but me ever stood up for them?
992080	994080	That's why everyone knows who Tabby is.
994080	997080	When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?
998080	1001080	Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.
1001080	1002080	But so what?
1002080	1005080	So male-to-anime Twitter stands you, big deal.
1005080	1006080	You're mad, aren't you?
1006080	1008080	I'll get over it in a few weeks.
1008080	1011080	Look, you're right, you have to be yourself.
1011080	1013080	Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.
1013080	1017080	So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,
1017080	1019080	then wear them well and make it work.
1019080	1021080	But sometimes being yourself is not enough.
1021080	1024080	Sometimes you have to become yourself.
1024080	1028080	And for you, I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.
1028080	1030080	I mean with the Nazis it's one thing,
1030080	1032080	but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.
1032080	1036080	I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else were willing to stick up for us.
1036080	1039080	Your delicate notion of femininity is a product of the privilege
1039080	1042080	you share with a lot of thin, white, cis feminists.
1042080	1046080	Wow, it must be so hard for you out on the streets as a fat woman of color.
1046080	1047080	Shut up.
1047080	1050080	I'm just saying, don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.
1050080	1053080	You could have what I have, you just have to work for it
1053080	1055080	instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.
1055080	1057080	You were raised a white boy.
1057080	1059080	You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.
1059080	1062080	And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,
1062080	1064080	but you still stand on a lot of privilege.
1064080	1067080	I look at all the photos of trans women who are murdered in this country
1067080	1069080	and they don't look like you or me.
1069080	1071080	Why don't you use your privilege and use your education
1071080	1073080	to actually do some good in the world
1073080	1075080	instead of this elective revolutionary LARPing.
1075080	1078080	You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.
1078080	1082080	I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.
1082080	1086080	I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.
1086080	1088080	You don't win friends and allies with a bat.
1088080	1089080	They're just using you.
1089080	1092080	Well, who do you think benefits and who do you think gets hurt
1092080	1096080	when you go out into the world and represent trans women as masculine and violent?
1096080	1100080	Who do you think benefits when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?
1100080	1102080	I guess we can't win, can we?
1102080	1105080	You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?
1105080	1106080	Yeah, okay.
1108080	1109080	Forget about the disrespect.
1109080	1110080	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1110080	1114080	It turns out that every chromosome, every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body
1114080	1117080	is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.
1117080	1119080	You don't know what you're talking about.
1119080	1120080	You're not educated on genetics.
1120080	1122080	Were you supposed to discuss the genetics or not?
1122080	1123080	What are your genetics?
1123080	1127080	You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1127080	1130080	Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.
1130080	1135080	You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1135080	1138080	So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,
1138080	1142080	I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community, which is so frustrating.
1142080	1143080	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1143080	1144080	Damage controlling.
1144080	1145080	So frustrating.
1145080	1146080	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1146080	1147080	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1147080	1148080	So frustrating.
1148080	1149080	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1149080	1152080	It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.
1152080	1155080	If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex and then talk about
1155080	1160080	you're a very feminine, biological man and you've had surgeries to prove it,
1160080	1164080	then I think that we can talk about what is the appropriate pronoun to use.
1164080	1165080	My problem is the...
1169080	1171080	Tabby, I don't want to fight with you.
1171080	1175080	We're surviving in this shit world together and you'll always be my sister.
1175080	1177080	Well, I'm glad.
1177080	1178080	I love you.
1178080	1179080	What?
1179080	1180080	Love.
1180080	1181080	I was in love once.
1181080	1186080	I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati, bent over a pool table.
1186080	1188080	The year was 1985.
1188080	1194080	And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey hits my nostrils at just the right moment,
1194080	1199080	I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth against my cheek.
1199080	1202080	Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.
1225080	1227080	Now I'm here with my friends
1227080	1229080	Like it was on my plan
1233080	1235080	If tonight ain't the end
1235080	1238080	Then I'm going to dance
1242080	1244080	While the lasers are high
1244080	1246080	And ambitions are low
1250080	1252080	As we reach for the sky
1252080	1254080	This is all that we know
1282080	1284080	Thanks for watching!
