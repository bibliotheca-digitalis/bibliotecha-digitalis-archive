00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.880
Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors, while complementary

00:11.880 --> 00:18.680
schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.

00:18.680 --> 00:23.600
Hi girls, I'm Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints, the internet show where we talk

00:23.600 --> 00:27.560
about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.120
This week, we'll be talking about colors.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.560
Colors!

00:32.560 --> 00:33.800
What the fuck are they?

00:33.800 --> 00:37.280
In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.920
Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
It's delicious!

00:42.920 --> 00:47.520
Now according to some so-called experts, color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
radiation.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.440
But what about the shadow illusion?

00:50.440 --> 00:52.600
Same wavelengths, different colors.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.280
Some people say I'm a man dressed as a lady, but I'm actually a lady who used to be a

00:57.280 --> 01:00.080
man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.440
Explain that, Professor Butler.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.600
Illusion.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.760
What matters more?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.240
The way things are, or the way things look?

01:07.240 --> 01:10.520
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.240
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um...

01:28.240 --> 01:30.000
It's too early for this.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Today my guests are, um...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.480
Well, who are you people?

01:38.480 --> 01:45.240
I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbain, Associate Professor of Women's Studies and author of many, many

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
books.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.760
Most recently, my doctoral thesis, Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.480
Oh, yes, and, uh, well you look familiar.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.480
Who are you?

02:06.480 --> 02:10.480
Okay, well, today my guests will be debating the topic...

02:11.480 --> 02:12.480
Um...

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
Well, here's a good one.

02:13.480 --> 02:17.480
Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?

02:17.480 --> 02:19.480
What do you think, Annabelle?

02:19.480 --> 02:24.080
Well, Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender begins with freedom

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
of speech.

02:25.080 --> 02:31.080
For instance, this cat person over here is clearly a biological male in some sort of

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
costume wig.

02:32.080 --> 02:37.280
Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes, but the fact remains that

02:37.280 --> 02:41.080
pronouns refer, as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.080
But perhaps you disagree, sir.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.080
That's a human rights violation!

02:47.080 --> 02:49.080
I'll smash your fucking face.

02:50.080 --> 02:55.080
And here we have a clear illustration of the way that transgender ideology is merely a

02:55.080 --> 02:58.080
smokescreen for male violence against women.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.080
And mind you, this is being taught in our schools, it's being forced on our children,

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
it's becoming mandatory...

03:02.080 --> 03:03.080
Security!

03:03.080 --> 03:04.080
Have this cat removed!

03:04.080 --> 03:09.080
The centers are being silenced, and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda,

03:09.080 --> 03:13.080
taking away women's rights, invading women's spaces, depriving us of what feminism has

03:13.080 --> 03:14.080
worked so hard to...

03:15.080 --> 03:19.080
I love a kitty queen, but Abigail clocks a cat.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.080
Gender's just like color.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.080
Some people see yellow, some people see blue.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.080
It's all a matter of opinion.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
Or is it?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.080
It's not.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.080
Let's hear the real tea.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.080
TABBY

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
Tabby.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.080
Sweetie baby.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
Princess.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
I feel ridiculous in this dress.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.080
Yeah, well you look ridiculous, cause you wouldn't take the goddamn cat ears off.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.080
I think I'm gonna take the dress off.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Well don't do that.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.080
I'm trying to help you out, girl.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.080
If you don't want to get misgendered, it helps to fem it up a little.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.080
I'm gonna take it off.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.080
Well don't leave.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.080
You can change in front of me, I'm not a prude.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.080
I'm gonna go behind the curtain.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.080
I like looking at naked people.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
Why do you always hit on me?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.080
I thought you were into men.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.080
Well I swing both ways.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.080
I like boy dick and girl dick.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.080
That's not how that works.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.080
I hate that.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
The heart wants what it wants.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.080
Why did you invite me over here anyway?

04:25.080 --> 04:28.080
I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report, and girl.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.080
Girl.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.080
You cannot be a trans woman on TV threatening people with a bat.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.080
You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?

04:36.080 --> 04:38.080
No, morally wrong.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
What does that even mean?

04:39.080 --> 04:41.080
It was much worse than morally wrong.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
It was aesthetically wrong.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.080
It was unfeminine.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
This is all you ever say to me.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.080
It's bad optics.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
It's bad aesthetics.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.080
Well does reality matter at all to you?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.080
Cause the reality is I am a woman.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.080
And maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one,

04:53.080 --> 04:55.080
but the way things look isn't all that matters.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.080
Tabby, this is politics.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.080
Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?

04:59.080 --> 05:02.080
Reality plays no role in politics.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
Politics is aesthetics.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.080
Politics is aesthetics?

05:06.080 --> 05:08.080
That's literally what fascism is.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.080
Have you even read Benjamin?

05:10.080 --> 05:14.080
Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
The military parades, the pageantry,

05:16.080 --> 05:19.080
and communism responds by politicizing art.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.080
This is what I can't stand about communists.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
You want to turn art into propaganda.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.080
Well art is already ideology.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.080
Ah, look, instead of ruining art,

05:27.080 --> 05:29.080
why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism

05:29.080 --> 05:32.080
with pageantry of our own.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
And you know who's gonna make that happen?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
Who?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.080
Well-funded trans women.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.080
Patreon's in the description.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Ew. Stop that.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
What?

05:41.080 --> 05:43.080
I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community

05:43.080 --> 05:47.080
by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
Is that so wrong?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
You're so bougie.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.080
I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
Revolutionary philosophers.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.080
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.080
Look, the point I'm trying to make is that the world we live in

05:59.080 --> 06:01.080
is not a philosophical world.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
Think about Instagram.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.080
It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.080
If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.080
No one sees that.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.080
They only see the show you're putting on.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.080
Okay, but life is not a show.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.080
Mmm, politics is a show.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.080
Look around you, Tabby.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.080
Try to understand what's happening to the world.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.080
The president of the United States is a reality TV star.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.080
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.080
In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle,

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
and it's important to know which you're in.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.080
Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
It's Rome.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.080
And your problem is you think you're in the forum,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.080
when you're really in the circus.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.080
I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.080
Now you're against reason too?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.080
I'm not against reason.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.080
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
If you're a man.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
And what if you're a woman?

06:49.080 --> 06:51.080
Oh, don't be a woman.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
That's not a good idea.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
Ow.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.080
Do you remember that debate between Blair White and that YouTuber with the pink wig?

06:56.080 --> 06:58.080
What was her name?

06:58.080 --> 06:59.080
I don't know.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
She was relevant back in 2017.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.080
Anyway, this was before she transitioned,

07:03.080 --> 07:06.080
and in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes,

07:06.080 --> 07:10.080
and the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.080
I vaguely remember.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.080
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Well, the pink wig lost that debate so bad,

07:16.080 --> 07:18.080
it was embarrassing to watch.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.080
Not really.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.080
I mean, she was right.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.080
And her arguments were better.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.080
Ahaha!

07:23.080 --> 07:25.080
Ah, Tabby.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.080
Sweetie, honey, angel, darling, princess, baby.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.080
Arguments don't matter.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
How pretty you are matters.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.080
Is this really where you're going with this?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.080
Tabby, if you want to be a public figure,

07:36.080 --> 07:39.080
sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans girl black pill.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
Oh boy.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.080
If you're a trans woman in the public eye,

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
what matters is one thing and one thing only.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.080
And it's always been the thing that matters.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.080
What?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
The realness.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.080
Verisimilitude.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.080
You have to look like a fucking woman.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.080
There it is.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
There it is is right.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.080
We don't say it in public, but we all know it, and we all feel it.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
What does it even mean to look like a woman?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.080
Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.080
I'm trying to have a real conversation here.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.080
We all know what it means.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.080
I don't know what it means.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.080
Women have a lot of different looks.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.080
There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.080
What is society's opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.080
Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.080
The dress is the last of my concerns.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.080
I mean, where do I even start with this?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.080
You're wearing combat boots.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
You cannot be wearing combat boots.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
Why not?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
A lot of cis women wear them.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.080
Cis women?

08:30.080 --> 08:32.080
Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
Fully clockable.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.080
So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.080
Yes, do not under any circumstances imitate cis women.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.080
They have no idea what they're doing.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.080
Where does your idea of womanhood even come from, then?

08:44.080 --> 08:46.080
Das ewigweibliche.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.080
The archetype of the eternal feminine.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.080
And where does that come from?

08:50.080 --> 08:52.080
Poets.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.080
Teenage gay boys on Instagram.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.080
The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.080
That's insanity.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.080
Is it?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.080
Tabby, look at my face.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.080
Look at this highlight.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.080
Does that look like the product of insanity to you?

09:06.080 --> 09:08.080
I mean, yeah, kind of.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.080
Love?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.080
Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.080
Good banter.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.080
Well done.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.080
But trans women have to overdo it.

09:15.080 --> 09:19.080
You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.080
You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.080
You need to smile, even at people who hate you.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.080
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.080
You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.080
Your hands are not tools.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.080
They're ornaments at the ends of your arms.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.080
So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
Literally a man's idea of a woman.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.080
Well, men have the power, men make the rules,

09:45.080 --> 09:48.080
and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood,

09:48.080 --> 09:51.080
so you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.

09:51.080 --> 09:56.080
I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.080
Not stereotypes.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
Performances.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.080
You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
Gender is performance.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.080
We're all born naked, and the rest is literally drag.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.080
Womanhood is not what you are, it's what you do.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.080
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womaning.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.080
So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.080
Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.

10:18.080 --> 10:22.080
I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.080
I mean performance in the sense of everything you do.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.080
The way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak.

10:28.080 --> 10:33.080
An authentic performance is just a habitual performance, and nothing more than that.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.080
So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?

10:37.080 --> 10:41.080
I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.080
You fake it till you make it.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.080
So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.080
That's what any woman is.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.080
What about gender non-conforming cis women?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.080
They're not doing womanhood in that way.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.080
Well yeah, that's why those women are marginalized.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.080
They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.080
You don't want to end up like that, do you?

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
And hold on, are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman,

11:05.080 --> 11:09.080
talks like a woman, takes female hormones, is gendered female by other people,

11:09.080 --> 11:12.080
and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,

11:12.080 --> 11:15.080
that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
Yep.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.080
That's absurd.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.080
But it's absurd because the example is absurd.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.080
No cis man would do that.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.080
It's like asking, is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?

11:25.080 --> 11:27.080
Like, yeah, pretty much.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.080
See, this is a philosophy at its worst.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.080
Pointless speculative fiction.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.080
And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,

11:33.080 --> 11:36.080
which is you getting rid of those combat boots.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
I thought we were talking about philosophy.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.080
No, we're talking about shoes.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?

11:42.080 --> 11:46.080
You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.080
The left will abide a regal queer.

11:51.080 --> 11:55.080
Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.080
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,

11:57.080 --> 12:00.080
then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.080
What matters is that we identify as women.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.080
We can express that identity in different ways,

12:05.080 --> 12:09.080
but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.080
But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.

12:12.080 --> 12:16.080
Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.080
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,

12:19.080 --> 12:22.080
then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter.

12:22.080 --> 12:26.080
Because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.080
That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.

12:29.080 --> 12:33.080
Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl. I'm trying to talk about what's really true.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.080
I didn't say it was insensitive. I said it was unfair.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.080
Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality

12:40.080 --> 12:43.080
that implies a potential to live your inner truth.

12:43.080 --> 12:47.080
No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter. It's just a troll example.

12:47.080 --> 12:52.080
True. But even if they were sincere, there would still be no reality to it

12:52.080 --> 12:55.080
because helicopter is not an actual social role.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.080
Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,

12:58.080 --> 13:02.080
but you have to work to get there, and ultimately society has to let you.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
What do you mean?

13:03.080 --> 13:07.080
I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,

13:07.080 --> 13:12.080
but if no one recognizes me as a doctor, then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?

13:12.080 --> 13:15.080
But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.080
All it takes is being misgendered.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.080
It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?

13:20.080 --> 13:23.080
Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you sir?

13:23.080 --> 13:27.080
Isn't it because, in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?

13:27.080 --> 13:30.080
That's ridiculous. I am a woman. That's my reality.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.080
I know you're a woman. I'm just saying that in that one moment,

13:35.080 --> 13:38.080
you effectively had your gender canceled.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.080
Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.080
There's no reasoning your way into it.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.080
But don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman. I smash.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.080
I know you do. And it's a bad look.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.080
Is this about the shoes again?

13:55.080 --> 13:57.080
Here, put these on.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.080
Absolutely not. I'm not wearing those.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.080
Yes, you are, bitch.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Nope.

14:02.080 --> 14:07.080
If you put these on, I'll, um, scratch you behind the ears later.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.080
Okay, fine.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080

Ugh, I'm never doing that again.

Why not? Because it's not who I am.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.080
All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.080
Well, that's not what aesthetics is.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.080
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.080
And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine,

15:54.080 --> 15:56.080
but I can be a first-rate Tabby.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.080
Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
about the importance of being yourself.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.080
Shut up!

16:02.080 --> 16:04.080
Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.080
I know I'm not pretty.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.080
And I know you think you're too good for me because you mostly pass.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.080
People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry, and that's weird.

16:14.080 --> 16:17.080
But I'm a fucking queer icon because I'm not like you.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.080
Because I'm not like anyone but myself.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.080
And because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.080
And I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow and deep voices

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
that girls, even other trans women, make fun of.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.080
And when in the history of the world

16:29.080 --> 16:32.080
has anyone but me ever stood up for them?

16:32.080 --> 16:34.080
That's why everyone knows who Tabby is.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.080
When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?

16:38.080 --> 16:41.080
Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.080
But so what?

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
So male-to-anime Twitter stands you, big deal.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
You're mad, aren't you?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.080
I'll get over it in a few weeks.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.080
Look, you're right, you have to be yourself.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.080
Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.080
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,

16:57.080 --> 16:59.080
then wear them well and make it work.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.080
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.080
Sometimes you have to become yourself.

17:04.080 --> 17:08.080
And for you, I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.080
I mean with the Nazis it's one thing,

17:10.080 --> 17:12.080
but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.

17:12.080 --> 17:16.080
I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else were willing to stick up for us.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.080
Your delicate notion of femininity is a product of the privilege

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
you share with a lot of thin, white, cis feminists.

17:22.080 --> 17:26.080
Wow, it must be so hard for you out on the streets as a fat woman of color.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.080
Shut up.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.080
I'm just saying, don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.080
You could have what I have, you just have to work for it

17:33.080 --> 17:35.080
instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.080
You were raised a white boy.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.080
You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.080
And yeah, it's hard being a trans woman of any background,

17:42.080 --> 17:44.080
but you still stand on a lot of privilege.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.080
I look at all the photos of trans women who are murdered in this country

17:47.080 --> 17:49.080
and they don't look like you or me.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.080
Why don't you use your privilege and use your education

17:51.080 --> 17:53.080
to actually do some good in the world

17:53.080 --> 17:55.080
instead of this elective revolutionary LARPing.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.080
You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.

17:58.080 --> 18:02.080
I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties with transphobes.

18:02.080 --> 18:06.080
I've seen minds change and hearts soften before my eyes.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.080
You don't win friends and allies with a bat.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
They're just using you.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.080
Well, who do you think benefits and who do you think gets hurt

18:12.080 --> 18:16.080
when you go out into the world and represent trans women as masculine and violent?

18:16.080 --> 18:20.080
Who do you think benefits when they trot you out to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?

18:20.080 --> 18:22.080
I guess we can't win, can we?

18:22.080 --> 18:25.080
You want to just chill out and watch YouTube videos?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
Yeah, okay.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.080
Forget about the disrespect.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
Facts don't care about your feelings.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.080
It turns out that every chromosome, every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body

18:34.080 --> 18:37.080
is male with the exception of some of his sperm cells.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.080
You don't know what you're talking about.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
You're not educated on genetics.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.080
Were you supposed to discuss the genetics or not?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
What are your genetics?

18:43.080 --> 18:47.080
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.080
Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.

18:50.080 --> 18:55.080
You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.080
So I look at that and I feel like on my end it's like I'm always,

18:58.080 --> 19:02.080
I feel like I'm always damage controlling for the trans community, which is so frustrating.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.080
Damage controlling.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.080
So frustrating.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
Facts don't care about your feelings.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.080
So frustrating.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.080
You'll go home in an ambulance.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.080
It's imperative that we actually use terms that refer to something.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.080
If you want to talk about gender as distinct from sex and then talk about

19:15.080 --> 19:20.080
you're a very feminine, biological man and you've had surgeries to prove it,

19:20.080 --> 19:24.080
then I think that we can talk about what is the appropriate pronoun to use.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.080
My problem is the...

19:29.080 --> 19:31.080
Tabby, I don't want to fight with you.

19:31.080 --> 19:35.080
We're surviving in this shit world together and you'll always be my sister.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.080
Well, I'm glad.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.080
I love you.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.080
What?

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
Love.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
I was in love once.

19:41.080 --> 19:46.080
I was in a smoky roadhouse outside Cincinnati, bent over a pool table.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.080
The year was 1985.

19:48.080 --> 19:54.080
And to this day, when the perfume of cheap whiskey hits my nostrils at just the right moment,

19:54.080 --> 19:59.080
I can almost feel the beer-stained billiard cloth against my cheek.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.080
Let's watch it all on VHS cassette to learn more.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.080
Now I'm here with my friends

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
Like it was on my plan

20:33.080 --> 20:35.080
If tonight ain't the end

20:35.080 --> 20:38.080
Then I'm going to dance

20:42.080 --> 20:44.080
While the lasers are high

20:44.080 --> 20:46.080
And ambitions are low

20:50.080 --> 20:52.080
As we reach for the sky

20:52.080 --> 20:54.080
This is all that we know

21:22.080 --> 21:24.080
Thanks for watching!
