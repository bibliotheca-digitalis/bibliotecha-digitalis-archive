0	9360	Hi boys, it's me again, just your average girl.
9360	14160	Look I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video, we're able
14160	16960	to converse as men.
16960	21320	I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between
21320	23160	now and the decline of Rome.
23160	24520	Do you like history boys?
24520	25960	How did Rome fall again?
25960	27840	Was it the gays?
27840	29240	Tell me all about it.
29240	34200	Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's
34200	36040	rights activists on the other.
36040	37040	Whatever happened to that?
37040	42440	These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.
42440	44240	I did want to do the fedora though.
44240	48200	Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I
48200	50440	wanted to put my own little twist on it.
50440	56600	My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.
56600	57600	School shooter realness.
57760	63560	I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.
63560	68640	In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?
68640	76200	Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.
76200	80480	Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting
80480	82680	in a state of psychological balance?
82680	86120	Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?
86120	90000	I guess, yeah, kind of, you don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual
90000	91000	medicine cabinets.
91000	93120	I'm losing my target audience here.
93120	96680	Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.
96680	98760	And I'm not saying I'm any better.
98760	100880	To be clear, I'm not okay either.
100880	104240	There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.
104240	107160	Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?
107160	108160	Get over it.
108160	112760	I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I for one will not
112760	115480	be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.
115480	118160	ðŸŽµ
118160	122120	Ugh, you boys, you're very rational, aren't you?
122120	124360	Ugh, I suppose I was too.
124360	129080	I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological
129080	131040	female and as a Pisces moon.
131040	136240	But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, Contra Pines, for men, I started
136240	142920	brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.
142920	147560	So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus
147560	153320	Logico-Philosophicus, and of course the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Calliante.
153320	158980	So my mind is well-lubricated and I'm ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating
158980	162520	intellectual interchange.
162520	167440	Look, I want to play by your rules, okay, so there will be no emotions in this video.
167440	174040	I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,
174040	175040	and deductive proof.
175040	178040	ðŸ””
178040	180040	ðŸ””
180040	182040	ðŸ””
182040	184040	ðŸ””
184040	187040	Actually, you know what?
187040	188040	Fuck that.
188040	191040	Let's listen to house music and do sax frogs.
191640	206640	ðŸ””
206640	208640	I'm pandering to the male gaze.
208640	209640	ðŸ””
209640	210640	Oh.
210640	211640	And the male straights.
211640	212640	ðŸ””
212640	213640	God I love attention.
213640	214640	Hey gorge.
214640	215640	Hey gorge.
215640	216640	Hey gorge.
216640	217640	Okay I'm ready.
217640	220640	Let's crack open a cold one boys.
221240	222240	ðŸ””
222240	225240	My hands are too pretty to open the can.
225240	227240	I need a man to do it for me.
227240	228240	ðŸ””
228240	229240	Heeeeeeelp.
229240	230240	Fuck it.
230240	231240	ðŸ””
231240	232240	Oh.
232240	234240	Okay that's super fucking pretty.
234240	235240	Hey gorge.
235240	236240	Hey gorge.
236240	239240	If there are any women still watching this video, I'm really sorry about all this.
239240	244240	Unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case how very dare, I'm a good Presbyterian.
244240	248240	And by Presbyterian I do mean pansexual, hey how are y'all.
248240	251240	Look the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.
251240	253240	Am I doing this right?
253240	254240	Is this what men like?
254240	255240	Straps.
255240	256240	Straps.
256240	258240	It is a risky look for a girl like me.
258240	263240	When you do a lingerie look, you know you're gonna wind up somewhere on the Frank-N-Furter-Violet-Tchotchke-Di-Devanti's spectrum.
263240	266240	Oh, but you don't know where exactly.
266240	268240	And that is a dangerous game, ladies.
268240	273240	I have to say though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.
273240	277240	But um, that could be because of the drugs.
277240	280240	Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.
280240	282240	And we're fooling around, okay?
282240	283240	Part one.
283240	286240	Oh wait, rational.
286240	290240	Axiom one, America's next top victim.
290240	295240	I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.
295240	299240	And I'm not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.
299240	301240	No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.
301240	304240	We have white people complaining about reverse racism.
304240	311240	We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rich prejudice.
311240	314240	That must be super fucking hard for you.
314240	318240	We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.
318240	323240	You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family
323240	326240	and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***ers.
326240	330240	And so of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.
330240	333240	I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,
333240	335240	and I've always been very skeptical.
335240	340240	Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.
340240	343240	Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,
343240	345240	and then a man shows up to say,
345240	347240	well what about men?
347240	348240	Men also get harassed.
348240	350240	Why aren't you talking about men?
350240	355240	And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?
355240	357240	Of course he's fucking not.
357240	359240	He doesn't give a shit.
359240	360240	He's a troll.
360240	365240	His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?
365240	366240	What about them, honey?
366240	369240	For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once,
369240	373240	and the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,
373240	376240	which is The Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.
376240	380240	Actually I listened to the audiobook, because let's be honest, reading is hard.
380240	385240	But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.
385240	390240	Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role
390240	392240	that confined women to domestic servitude.
392240	396240	But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society
396240	401240	is actually an illusion, because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.
401240	404240	He introduces the idea of male disposability,
404240	409240	basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,
409240	414240	which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.
414240	418240	He points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,
418240	422240	workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.
422240	427240	So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,
427240	433240	in fact the queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided for
433240	436240	by the expendable male worker bees.
436240	438240	And I guess that kind of makes sense.
438240	441240	I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.
441240	447240	What I'm saying is, I took the red pill, and I rubbed it on my cluuuuuuuuuuut.
447240	450240	But some initial objections come to mind.
450240	455240	Like haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?
455240	458240	Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?
458240	461240	I dunno boys, still seems kinda patriarchal to me.
461240	467240	But maybe he'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.
467240	473240	Maybe the average man is also oppressed by this system that feminists call patriarchy.
473240	477240	If that's what you're saying, I think I basically agree with that.
477240	482240	See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.
482240	484240	Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,
484240	488240	well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,
488240	493240	and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuuuuuuuuuuts.
493240	497240	But no, my Scorpio-rising persona will not allow that.
497240	499240	Oh, there will be a champion.
499240	500240	There will be blood.
500240	506240	So, judges, how do we decide which gender is America's next top victim?
506240	511240	I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.
511240	513240	Or can you?
513240	515240	Proposition 2.
515240	517240	Diary of an X-Man.
517240	524240	Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.
524240	526240	Mom!
526240	528240	Get out of my room!
528240	529240	You're ruining my life!
529240	534240	Look, I've never, ever talked about this on my channel before,
534240	537240	so this is like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,
537240	539240	but I was born a boy.
539240	541240	Well, was I ever really a boy?
541240	543240	It's hard to say.
543240	547240	Dear diary, growing up I always knew that I was different from other kids,
547240	549240	especially other boys,
549240	552240	and it took me so long to pinpoint what it was,
552240	555240	but there was this moment.
555240	558240	I must have been, what, 7, 8 years old?
558240	561240	And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself,
561240	565240	and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor,
565240	567240	and I don't know what it was,
567240	570240	it was like this magnetism that drew me to them.
570240	572240	And I put my little feet in them,
572240	574240	and walked in front of the mirror,
574240	578240	and I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt,
578240	581240	but basically in that moment,
581240	583240	I sensed that God had made a mistake,
583240	586240	and I was destined to be,
586240	589240	to be a crossdresser.
591240	593240	That is super fucking coconuts.
593240	596240	Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart,
596240	597240	and I became a woman, hey how are you?
597240	599240	I became one of the dolls.
599240	601240	My plastic surgeon is an artist.
601240	603240	Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is,
603240	605240	I used to live your lifestyle.
605240	607240	I know what people like you get up to,
607240	609240	and I think it's disgusting.
609240	611240	I gotta say though, since I transitioned,
611240	613240	my life has been super fucking great.
613240	614240	Like, way better.
614240	617240	Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it better than men,
617240	622240	but because, hey gorge, I am literally transgendered.
622240	625240	So before I transitioned, I was dying inside, you know?
625240	627240	I was in the wrong body.
627240	632240	And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.
632240	634240	But it's not just that.
634240	637240	I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,
637240	639240	people actually do treat me better.
639240	642240	I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,
642240	645240	but that's probably for the best.
645240	648240	Now before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,
648240	650240	I guess I should say a couple caveats.
650240	655240	Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are not like other boys,
655240	659240	and most of us were not living the business-class male experience by any means.
659240	663240	You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics, tormented sissies,
663240	669240	secretive transvestites, poets, you know, that sort of thing.
669240	674240	Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience,
674240	679240	and I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me, hey how are you.
680240	685240	Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually just bragging?
685240	689240	You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful,
689240	693240	and I've come so far, in part because I'm white, and I'm skinny,
693240	697240	and I'm young, and I'm blonde, and I'm rich, and I pass,
697240	702240	and I'm educated, and I'm popular, and my plastic surgeon is an artist,
702240	706240	and my boyfriend is really rich and hot, and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.
706240	709240	And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate
709240	713240	is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have
713240	718240	that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.
718240	720240	From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,
720240	724240	that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.
724240	727240	What I was saying is, there are ways that people treat me better now
727240	729240	that I'm presenting as a woman.
729240	732240	You know, people smile at me more, I feel more taken care of,
732240	734240	men do things for me.
734240	737240	Now a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,
737240	739240	you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,
739240	743240	because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.
743240	744240	But not me.
744240	747240	I love it, both because I love attention,
747240	749240	and because I'm a recumbent queen
749240	752240	who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.
752240	754240	I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me
754240	756240	to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,
756240	759240	I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift,
759240	763240	and then some man will usually get up and do it for me,
763240	765240	even though I'm taller than most men.
765240	766240	It makes me happy.
766240	768240	Another good thing about becoming a woman is
768240	770240	I integrated into female social groups,
770240	773240	and I found that they provide a kind of communal support
773240	778240	and overt affection that male social groups generally just don't.
778240	781240	I find the female social style suits me better than the male one,
781240	784240	which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,
784240	786240	where affection is always concealed
786240	789240	behind this semi-jokey front of competition.
789240	792240	Like, think about the way boys talk to each other
792240	793240	when they play video games.
793240	795240	A third improvement for me has to do with the way
795240	797240	men and women are treated in public space.
797240	799240	When you present female in public,
799240	802240	you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle
802240	803240	to be commented upon.
803240	808240	People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about you,
808240	810240	sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,
810240	813240	sometimes just fucking weird.
813240	815240	Whereas, when you present male in public,
815240	819240	you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.
819240	822240	Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences
822240	825240	as men asserting dominance over women in public space,
825240	828240	and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying,
828240	830240	degrading, and misogynistic.
830240	832240	And it certainly can be all of those things.
832240	834240	But there's different kinds of catcalling,
834240	836240	and I have different feelings about them.
836240	838240	If I'm walking with another woman,
838240	839240	and a man says,
839240	841240	ladies, you look beautiful tonight.
841240	843240	I don't know, I like that.
843240	844240	I think that's nice.
844240	847240	It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired.
847240	848240	It boosts my confidence.
848240	850240	Whereas, if I'm walking alone,
850240	853240	and a drunk starts following me down the street,
853240	854240	singing,
854240	856240	have you seen a polythene pam?
856240	859240	She's so good looking, but she looks like a man.
859240	863240	That, I am less enthusiastic about.
863240	865240	I mean, not that that's ever happened.
865240	868240	I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey how are you.
868240	871240	No one knows what it's like
871240	874240	to be a sad tram.
874240	876240	I definitely get where feminists are coming from,
876240	878240	because street harassment sucks.
878240	880240	I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night
880240	881240	than I used to be,
881240	884240	and there's a lot more places I just won't go by myself.
884240	886240	But on the other hand,
886240	889240	I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night
889240	891240	without other people acting afraid of me.
891240	894240	I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine
894240	897240	the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous
897240	900240	can also kind of suck.
900240	901240	In my video on incels,
901240	904240	I talked about male invisibility on dating apps,
904240	906240	and how getting no attention at all
906240	908240	can actually be emotionally worse
908240	910240	than getting a lot of shitty attention.
910240	913240	And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,
913240	915240	when I was living as a man,
915240	917240	sometimes if I was walking at night,
917240	919240	a woman on the same block as me
919240	921240	would change sides of the street.
921240	923240	And I totally get why.
923240	926240	Men do scary shit sometimes, and it's better to be safe.
926240	928240	But it still stung a little bit
928240	931240	to be treated as dangerous by default.
931240	933240	I think it can actually be harmful,
933240	936240	which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.
936240	938240	There's ways that white women's fear
938240	942240	can actually be dangerous, in particular, to black men.
942240	943240	I had an experience with this recently
943240	945240	when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,
945240	947240	and I'd rented a room in a hotel casino.
947240	950240	Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment
950240	952240	up to my room, and I got into the elevator
952240	954240	with a group of people from the casino floor.
954240	957240	A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator
957240	960240	except for me and a single black man.
960240	962240	Well, I mean, he was alone.
962240	963240	I don't know if he was single.
963240	964240	That's not part of the story.
964240	965240	And as soon as the door closed,
965240	967240	he started literally whistling
967240	969240	row, row, row your boat,
969240	971240	the official melody of performative innocence.
971240	976240	And I realized, oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid.
976240	978240	And I found that just excruciating.
978240	980240	I was like, oh god,
980240	983240	how do other white women behave in elevators?
983240	986240	Do they like clutch their purses?
986240	989240	Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing.
989240	991240	Nothing like that had ever happened to me
991240	992240	when I was living as a man.
992240	995240	It's not a thing between black men and white men.
995240	998240	It's a thing between black men and white women.
998240	999240	And so that dynamic was there
999240	1001240	not just because I'm white and he's black,
1001240	1004240	but because I'm a woman and he's a man.
1004240	1006240	And I thought of that incident again
1006240	1008240	when I was listening to the myth of male power,
1008240	1009240	and Farrell says,
1009240	1012240	men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength,
1012240	1016240	and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.
1016240	1018240	I think there is some truth to the idea
1018240	1021240	that women's perceived vulnerability can make them powerful,
1021240	1024240	and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.
1024240	1026240	Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt
1026240	1029240	because these are just some little observations I've made
1029240	1031240	based on a handful of anecdotes.
1031240	1033240	And as rational males,
1033240	1035240	it's important that we consider the facts,
1035240	1037240	the stats, and the figures.
1037240	1040240	Did you know that 46% of men
1040240	1045240	are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?
1046240	1047240	Look it up.
1047240	1048240	I haven't.
1048240	1050240	I guess my super fucking Libra opinion
1050240	1052240	is that there's upsides and downsides
1052240	1054240	to male and female experience.
1054240	1056240	I don't actually think there's a single definite answer
1056240	1058240	to the vague and useless question,
1058240	1060240	which gender has it worse?
1060240	1061240	I consider myself a feminist
1061240	1063240	because I support reproductive rights
1063240	1065240	and I oppose workplace misogyny,
1065240	1067240	and I generally agree with a lot of the activism
1067240	1070240	that happens under the heading of feminism.
1070240	1071240	But I also think a lot of men
1071240	1074240	are just having a super fucking difficult time right now,
1074240	1076240	and that must be super fucking hard for them, eh?
1076240	1077240	How are you?
1077240	1078240	And I don't think feminists
1078240	1080240	have an obligation to care about male ex,
1080240	1083240	but I care about you boys.
1083240	1084240	God, I'm such a cool girl,
1084240	1086240	I think the entire mid-Atlantic region
1086240	1087240	is about to freeze over.
1087240	1090240	No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,
1090240	1093240	and I really try to understand other people's pain
1093240	1098240	because I just find it really, really funny.
1098240	1101240	I'm also really, really sobering up here.
1101240	1103240	The drugs have worn off,
1103240	1107240	and I'm suddenly feeling very naked.
1107240	1109240	Like, it's just now occurring to me
1109240	1112240	that this is a highly inappropriate outfit
1112240	1113240	for this occasion.
1113240	1116240	So, I'm gonna go put on a robe,
1116240	1119240	and I'll meet you back for the next section.
1119240	1122240	Postulate three, the man question.
1127240	1130240	Hi boys, et cetera, et cetera.
1130240	1131240	Hey, how are you?
1131240	1133240	For the last three years on this channel,
1133240	1135240	I have been your Virgil,
1135240	1137240	leading you through gender hell.
1137240	1140240	Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels,
1140240	1143240	radical feminists, non-binary genders,
1143240	1144240	men's rights activists.
1144240	1147240	It seems like everybody's having gender trouble,
1147240	1149240	so what do we make of that?
1149240	1150240	Well, Gorge,
1150240	1154240	a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel
1154240	1157240	once said that the unfolding of history
1157240	1159240	is a basically rational process, Gorge.
1159240	1162240	That means that at any time in history,
1162240	1164240	society is based on certain principles,
1164240	1167240	like all men are created equal
1167240	1169240	as long as they're super fucking rich and white.
1169240	1172240	And there's always contradictions within those principles
1172240	1174240	which creates tension
1174240	1177240	and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution,
1177240	1179240	where society has to be reorganized
1179240	1180240	according to new principles.
1180240	1182240	At least, I think he was saying something like that.
1182240	1184240	It's pretty hard to make anything out
1184240	1186240	through the fog of his unreadable,
1186240	1187240	hyper-abstract man jabbering.
1187240	1189240	God, I can't stand that shit,
1189240	1191240	or any of the other music-hating vol-cells
1191240	1193240	of the male philosophical tradition.
1193240	1196240	My point is, I think our society has reached a place
1196240	1199240	where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.
1199240	1201240	Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working
1201240	1202240	or how to fix it,
1202240	1204240	but we do all agree that it's broken.
1204240	1206240	We have mainstream feminists saying
1206240	1208240	we need to continue advancing the rights of women.
1208240	1209240	We have conservatives saying
1209240	1212240	we need to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.
1212240	1213240	We have an increasing number of people
1213240	1215240	not identifying as men or women.
1215240	1217240	We have TERFs who think that the transgenders
1217240	1219240	are the single greatest threat to civilization,
1219240	1220240	hey, how are you?
1220240	1222240	And we have men's rights activists saying
1222240	1224240	we need a male equivalent to feminism
1224240	1227240	to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.
1227240	1229240	Now, I want to focus on that last one,
1229240	1232240	because in principle, I agree.
1232240	1233240	I've spent a lot of the last three years
1233240	1235240	covering the manosphere.
1235240	1237240	I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.
1237240	1239240	And from all the time I've tortured myself
1239240	1241240	wading through these communities of incels,
1241240	1244240	pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,
1244240	1247240	intellectual dark web fanboys, and alt-right racists,
1247240	1251240	I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,
1251240	1252240	which is that they all recruit
1252240	1256240	from the same massive pool of sad young men.
1256240	1257240	We all know the Archetype.
1257240	1259240	He has trouble relating to women,
1259240	1261240	he has no strong friendship group,
1261240	1263240	he's not excited about any long-term goals,
1263240	1266240	and he fills the void with video games and porn.
1266240	1267240	And just to clarify,
1267240	1269240	I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn,
1269240	1271240	I'm not telling you what to do with your penis,
1271240	1273240	you can rub one out to this video for all I care,
1273240	1276240	just don't pull a gamer gate on me, okay?
1276240	1278240	I live in fear.
1278240	1279240	Look, I like to believe
1279240	1282240	that until the red pillars inject their poison,
1282240	1285240	most of these boys are not bad people.
1285240	1286240	I think all of this originates
1286240	1288240	in a genuine crisis of male identity,
1288240	1290240	and I think it's happened in something
1290240	1293240	like the way men's rights activists describe.
1293240	1295240	The sacrificial role of men as warriors
1295240	1298240	is no longer widely glorified or necessary.
1298240	1300240	The traditional protector-provider role of men
1300240	1302240	is being replaced by a more equal
1302240	1304240	and undefined gender dynamic.
1304240	1306240	And college professors and activists
1306240	1308240	are telling men that most of our culture's
1308240	1310240	aspirational representations of manhood
1310240	1312240	are toxic and bad.
1312240	1314240	But without an attractive replacement vision
1314240	1316240	of aspirational manhood,
1316240	1319240	average young men can only envision their future as...
1319240	1320240	what?
1320240	1321240	The beta.
1321240	1322240	The cock.
1322240	1324240	The new male.
1324240	1326240	And in a post-left-tube internet,
1326240	1328240	we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.
1328240	1331240	And to be fair, it is very funny.
1331240	1333240	But we forget, especially us grills,
1333240	1335240	that for a lot of men, these words actually do
1335240	1338240	tap into a deep existential angst.
1338240	1339240	And a lot of leftists go,
1339240	1341240	well how can men be so angsty?
1341240	1344240	Especially white men, they're so privileged.
1344240	1348240	But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.
1348240	1350240	If you're actually being oppressed,
1350240	1351240	you have a struggle,
1351240	1353240	you have something to fight for,
1353240	1355240	and therefore, a purpose.
1355240	1356240	But for a lot of men,
1356240	1359240	their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.
1359240	1362240	And that, along with the loneliness
1362240	1364240	and the lack of a positive identity,
1364240	1366240	is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment
1366240	1368240	by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.
1368240	1371240	And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor
1371240	1374240	for the small but growing number of young men
1374240	1375240	who decide to pick up a gun
1375240	1378240	and open fire in a shopping center.
1378240	1379240	There were two mass shootings
1379240	1381240	during the weekend I was writing this video,
1381240	1383240	resulting in 31 deaths.
1383240	1385240	Both shooters were young white men,
1385240	1387240	and one of them posted about the shooting
1387240	1388240	on an alt-right image board.
1388240	1390240	Now I don't pretend to fully understand
1390240	1391240	the motives of mass shooters,
1391240	1393240	but I don't think it's a coincidence
1393240	1395240	that basically all of them are men.
1395240	1398240	One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic
1398240	1401240	is that these killers are trying to resurrect
1401240	1404240	some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,
1404240	1408240	and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men
1408240	1411240	by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.
1411240	1413240	And of course there's also the racism
1413240	1414240	of the alt-right killers,
1414240	1416240	and the wounded sexual entitlement
1416240	1417240	of the incel killers.
1417240	1420240	But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,
1420240	1423240	and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis
1423240	1425240	are more receptive to learning it.
1425240	1428240	So you can try to take down their forums
1428240	1430240	and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,
1430240	1434240	but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,
1434240	1437240	I don't see any end to these problems.
1437240	1439240	Theorem four, what do?
1439240	1442240	There is this media narrative that has emerged
1442240	1444240	around me and around this channel.
1444240	1446240	And by the way, the fact that there's any kind
1446240	1448240	of media narrative about this channel
1448240	1450240	is super fucking coconuts.
1450240	1452240	Because let's be real, Gorge,
1452240	1454240	I just wanted to pour milk on my face
1454240	1455240	and talk about the mouthfeel.
1455240	1457240	But there's this media narrative
1457240	1459240	that my role in the discourse is
1459240	1463240	de-radicalizing young alt-right men.
1463240	1465240	And it's true that if you read
1465240	1467240	the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,
1467240	1469240	I used to be alt-right posts
1469240	1471240	are so common they're considered cliche.
1472240	1474240	And some of them cite me as an influence
1474240	1476240	in changing their politics,
1476240	1478240	which I love for them,
1478240	1480240	and I'm super fucking happy about it,
1480240	1483240	but it's also a lot of responsibility.
1483240	1485240	They're my boys,
1485240	1487240	and I worry about my boys.
1487240	1489240	Because in reality,
1489240	1491240	it's not like they go from far-right extremists
1491240	1493240	to complacent centrists, no.
1493240	1495240	Most of them go far left.
1495240	1497240	A lot of them become communists or anarchists.
1497240	1499240	So I watch them go from far to my right
1499240	1501240	to significantly to my left.
1501240	1503240	It's not really de-radicalizing
1503240	1505240	so much as re-radicalizing.
1505240	1507240	And I think it's definitely an improvement,
1507240	1509240	but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.
1509240	1511240	I worry about my boys,
1511240	1513240	because I don't think that the left yet
1513240	1516240	has a final solution to the man question.
1516240	1518240	Oh no, that was worded poorly.
1518240	1520240	You know, there's kind of two options
1520240	1522240	the left has for disillusioned men.
1522240	1524240	The first is the Marxist promise
1524240	1526240	of economic revolution.
1526240	1528240	We say, well, actually yes, you are oppressed,
1528240	1530240	but you're oppressed because of your class,
1530240	1532240	not your gender.
1532240	1534240	So just join the revolution,
1534240	1536240	it's gonna be super fucking crazy,
1536240	1538240	we're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie,
1538240	1540240	meow meow, smash, no voting,
1540240	1542240	and then things will be better for you.
1542240	1544240	Now, I think that has a couple limitations.
1544240	1546240	One is that I look at the far left,
1546240	1548240	and I see a bunch of people
1548240	1550240	who spend all their time accusing each other
1550240	1552240	of abusing moderator privileges
1552240	1554240	in closed Facebook groups.
1554240	1556240	And I'm concerned that
1556240	1558240	we might not succeed at ending capitalism,
1558240	1560240	meow meow.
1560240	1562240	Like, definitely vote for Bernie Sanders
1562240	1564240	or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,
1564240	1566240	but if you're investing all of your hopes
1566240	1568240	in a capital R revolution,
1568240	1570240	I worry that can become like waiting for Godot,
1570240	1572240	or waiting for the rapture.
1572240	1574240	So we do need political change,
1574240	1576240	but I feel like I'm failing
1576240	1578240	my boys
1578240	1580240	if I'm somehow giving them the idea
1580240	1582240	that revolution is their only hope.
1582240	1584240	Because here's the other thing,
1584240	1586240	if we succeed ending capitalism,
1586240	1588240	there would still be gender,
1588240	1590240	and my boys would still need some model
1590240	1592240	of what it is to lead a good life
1592240	1594240	as a man.
1594240	1596240	Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men
1596240	1598240	is the feminist tranquilizer.
1598240	1600240	We say, look, toxic masculinity
1600240	1602240	is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings,
1602240	1604240	and it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.
1604240	1606240	So while feminism tells women
1606240	1608240	you hate your body and you're constantly
1608240	1610240	doubting yourself because society
1610240	1612240	did this to you and needs to change,
1612240	1614240	we kind of just tell men
1614240	1616240	you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.
1616240	1618240	Stop it.
1618240	1620240	We tell them they're broken without really telling them
1620240	1622240	how to fix themselves.
1622240	1624240	I think what we need is a new, positive
1624240	1626240	ideal of manhood,
1626240	1628240	which I don't think is something that women can create
1628240	1630240	for men, even if they wanted to.
1630240	1632240	And honestly, the best way for that to happen
1632240	1634240	may actually be some kind of men's movement.
1634240	1636240	But on the left, the whole idea
1636240	1638240	of a men's movement is basically taboo
1638240	1640240	because the men's movement we all know
1640240	1642240	is basically just a backlash to feminism.
1642240	1644240	And at worst,
1644240	1646240	it's just straight-up misogyny.
1646240	1648240	And look boys, I understand that being
1648240	1650240	lectured about manspreading for most of 2015
1650240	1652240	was super fucking hard for you
1652240	1654240	and you're still mad about it,
1654240	1656240	but posting endless outrage porn
1656240	1658240	about false rape accusations
1658240	1660240	and paternity fraud isn't actually
1660240	1662240	going to make life any better for you.
1662240	1664240	Because yes, those things are horrible
1664240	1666240	when they happen, but they're not
1666240	1668240	systemic issues that affect most men.
1668240	1670240	I think what would actually improve life
1670240	1672240	for most men
1672240	1674240	is a positive ideal of
1674240	1676240	21st century manhood.
1676240	1678240	But that's not something I can give to you
1678240	1680240	because, in case you hadn't noticed,
1680240	1682240	I'm literally a fucking woman.
1682240	1684240	I can't mom you through this one, boys,
1684240	1686240	you're on your own. You have to help each other.
1686240	1688240	So find each other in the comments section,
1688240	1690240	meet up on Reddit,
1690240	1692240	make friends, clean your room,
1692240	1694240	leave the house. Fuck each other.
1694240	1696240	I don't know. It's worth a try.
1696240	1698240	And failing that,
1698240	1700240	you could always throw in the towel
1700240	1702240	and become a woman.
1702240	1704240	Worked for me.
1726240	1728240	Worked for me.
1756240	1758240	I'm just trying to give, like,
1758240	1760240	milady energy.
1760240	1762240	Yeah, it is English.
1762240	1764240	It's very John McClane, very Quentin Crisp,
1764240	1766240	very aristocrat.
1766240	1768240	I'm super fucking naked right now.
1768240	1770240	That's crazy.
1770240	1772240	That's super fucking crazy.
1772240	1774240	According to traditional gender roles,
1774240	1776240	men are useful for their labor,
1776240	1778240	and women are useful for their wombs.
1778240	1780240	Well, I'm a woman without a womb,
1780240	1782240	so I guess I'm useless.
1782240	1784240	But I'm beautifully useless.
1784240	1786240	Ugh, I'm a work of art.
1786240	1788240	The problem with our society is we've turned
1788240	1790240	men into women. It's disgusting.
1790240	1792240	As an ally to men,
1792240	1794240	it's not my place to speak
1794240	1796240	for them or speak over them,
1796240	1798240	but I just want to use my platform
1798240	1800240	to uplift
1800240	1802240	some male voices who
1802240	1804240	might not have
1804240	1806240	as many subscribers as me.
1806240	1808240	Okay.
1808240	1810240	Meh.
1810240	1812240	I'm not a
1812240	1814240	pergamos. I don't need a rich husband.
1814240	1816240	If I may quote Cher,
1816240	1818240	I don't need a rich man.
1818240	1820240	I am a rich man.
1820240	1822240	It's not even really much of an insult being called
1822240	1824240	a delusional man. Many great
1824240	1826240	books have been written by delusional men.
1828240	1830240	So bad.
1830240	1832240	I'm bad.
1832240	1834240	I'm really bad.
1834240	1836240	Okay.
