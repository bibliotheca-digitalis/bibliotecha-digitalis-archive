1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hi boys, it's me again, just your average girl.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,160
Look I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video, we're able

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
to converse as men.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,320
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,160
now and the decline of Rome.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,520
Do you like history boys?

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,960
How did Rome fall again?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,840
Was it the gays?

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,240
Tell me all about it.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,200
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,040
rights activists on the other.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Whatever happened to that?

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,440
These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
I did want to do the fedora though.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,200
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,440
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,600
My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
School shooter realness.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,560
I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,640
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,480
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,680
in a state of psychological balance?

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,120
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,000
I guess, yeah, kind of, you don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
medicine cabinets.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,120
I'm losing my target audience here.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,680
Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,760
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,880
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,160
Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Get over it.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I for one will not

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,480
be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,160
ðŸŽµ

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,120
Ugh, you boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,360
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,080
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,040
female and as a Pisces moon.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,240
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, Contra Pines, for men, I started

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,920
brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,560
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,320
Logico-Philosophicus, and of course the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Calliante.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,980
So my mind is well-lubricated and I'm ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,520
intellectual interchange.

47
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,440
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay, so there will be no emotions in this video.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,040
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
and deductive proof.

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040

Actually, you know what?

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Fuck that.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Let's listen to house music and do sax frogs.

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:26,640
ðŸ””

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Oh.

61
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
And the male straights.

ðŸ””

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
God I love attention.

Hey gorge.

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Hey gorge.

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Hey gorge.

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Okay I'm ready.

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Let's crack open a cold one boys.

00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,240
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
I need a man to do it for me.

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Heeeeeeelp.

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Fuck it.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
ðŸ””

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Oh.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Okay that's super fucking pretty.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Hey gorge.

79
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Hey gorge.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,240
If there are any women still watching this video, I'm really sorry about all this.

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case how very dare, I'm a good Presbyterian.

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
And by Presbyterian I do mean pansexual, hey how are y'all.

83
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Look the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

84
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Am I doing this right?

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Is this what men like?

86
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Straps.

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Straps.

88
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,240
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're gonna wind up somewhere on the Frank-N-Furter-Violet-Tchotchke-Di-Devanti's spectrum.

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Oh, but you don't know where exactly.

91
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
And that is a dangerous game, ladies.

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,240
I have to say though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,240
But um, that could be because of the drugs.

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
And we're fooling around, okay?

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Part one.

97
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Oh wait, rational.

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Axiom one, America's next top victim.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.

100
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,240
And I'm not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,240
We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rich prejudice.

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
That must be super fucking hard for you.

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,240
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***ers.

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
And so of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
and I've always been very skeptical.

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,

113
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
and then a man shows up to say,

114
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
well what about men?

115
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Men also get harassed.

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Why aren't you talking about men?

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Of course he's fucking not.

119
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
He doesn't give a shit.

120
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
He's a troll.

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,240
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
What about them, honey?

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once,

124
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,240
and the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
which is The Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Actually I listened to the audiobook, because let's be honest, reading is hard.

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,240
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.

128
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role

129
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
that confined women to domestic servitude.

130
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,240
is actually an illusion, because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

132
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,240
He introduces the idea of male disposability,

133
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,240
basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,240
which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
He points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

137
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,240
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,240
in fact the queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided for

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
by the expendable male worker bees.

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
And I guess that kind of makes sense.

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,240
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill, and I rubbed it on my cluuuuuuuuuuut.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,240
But some initial objections come to mind.

144
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Like haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?

145
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I dunno boys, still seems kinda patriarchal to me.

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,240
But maybe he'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.

148
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Maybe the average man is also oppressed by this system that feminists call patriarchy.

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,240
If that's what you're saying, I think I basically agree with that.

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,240
See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,

153
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuuuuuuuuuuts.

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,240
But no, my Scorpio-rising persona will not allow that.

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, there will be a champion.

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
There will be blood.

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,240
So, judges, how do we decide which gender is America's next top victim?

158
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Or can you?

160
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Proposition 2.

161
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Diary of an X-Man.

162
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

163
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Mom!

164
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Get out of my room!

165
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
You're ruining my life!

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Look, I've never, ever talked about this on my channel before,

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
so this is like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

168
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
but I was born a boy.

169
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Well, was I ever really a boy?

170
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
It's hard to say.

171
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Dear diary, growing up I always knew that I was different from other kids,

172
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
especially other boys,

173
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
and it took me so long to pinpoint what it was,

174
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
but there was this moment.

175
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I must have been, what, 7, 8 years old?

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself,

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,240
and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor,

178
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
and I don't know what it was,

179
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
it was like this magnetism that drew me to them.

180
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
And I put my little feet in them,

181
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
and walked in front of the mirror,

182
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
and I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt,

183
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,240
but basically in that moment,

184
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I sensed that God had made a mistake,

185
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,240
and I was destined to be,

186
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,240
to be a crossdresser.

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
That is super fucking coconuts.

188
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart,

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
and I became a woman, hey how are you?

190
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I became one of the dolls.

191
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

192
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is,

193
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I used to live your lifestyle.

194
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
I know what people like you get up to,

195
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
and I think it's disgusting.

196
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
I gotta say though, since I transitioned,

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
my life has been super fucking great.

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Like, way better.

199
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it better than men,

200
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,240
but because, hey gorge, I am literally transgendered.

201
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
So before I transitioned, I was dying inside, you know?

202
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I was in the wrong body.

203
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,240
And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.

204
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
But it's not just that.

205
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,

206
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
people actually do treat me better.

207
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,

208
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,240
but that's probably for the best.

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Now before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,

210
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I guess I should say a couple caveats.

211
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are not like other boys,

212
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,240
and most of us were not living the business-class male experience by any means.

213
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics, tormented sissies,

214
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,240
secretive transvestites, poets, you know, that sort of thing.

215
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience,

216
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,240
and I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me, hey how are you.

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually just bragging?

218
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,240
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful,

219
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,240
and I've come so far, in part because I'm white, and I'm skinny,

220
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,240
and I'm young, and I'm blonde, and I'm rich, and I pass,

221
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,240
and I'm educated, and I'm popular, and my plastic surgeon is an artist,

222
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot, and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

223
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate

224
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,240
is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have

225
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,240
that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,

227
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.

228
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,240
What I was saying is, there are ways that people treat me better now

229
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
that I'm presenting as a woman.

230
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
You know, people smile at me more, I feel more taken care of,

231
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
men do things for me.

232
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Now a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

234
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,240
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

235
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
But not me.

236
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,240
I love it, both because I love attention,

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
and because I'm a recumbent queen

238
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

239
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift,

242
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me,

243
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
even though I'm taller than most men.

244
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
It makes me happy.

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Another good thing about becoming a woman is

246
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I integrated into female social groups,

247
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
and I found that they provide a kind of communal support

248
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,240
and overt affection that male social groups generally just don't.

249
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I find the female social style suits me better than the male one,

250
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,

251
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
where affection is always concealed

252
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,240
behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

253
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other

254
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
when they play video games.

255
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

256
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
men and women are treated in public space.

257
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
When you present female in public,

258
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle

259
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
to be commented upon.

260
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,240
People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about you,

261
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,

262
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,240
sometimes just fucking weird.

263
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Whereas, when you present male in public,

264
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,240
you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.

265
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences

266
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
as men asserting dominance over women in public space,

267
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,240
and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying,

268
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
degrading, and misogynistic.

269
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
And it certainly can be all of those things.

270
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
But there's different kinds of catcalling,

271
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
and I have different feelings about them.

272
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
If I'm walking with another woman,

273
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
and a man says,

274
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
ladies, you look beautiful tonight.

275
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I don't know, I like that.

276
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I think that's nice.

277
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,240
It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired.

278
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
It boosts my confidence.

279
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Whereas, if I'm walking alone,

280
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
and a drunk starts following me down the street,

281
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
singing,

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
have you seen a polythene pam?

283
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
She's so good looking, but she looks like a man.

284
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,240
That, I am less enthusiastic about.

285
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
I mean, not that that's ever happened.

286
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey how are you.

287
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
No one knows what it's like

288
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
to be a sad tram.

289
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I definitely get where feminists are coming from,

290
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
because street harassment sucks.

291
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night

292
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
than I used to be,

293
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,240
and there's a lot more places I just won't go by myself.

294
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
But on the other hand,

295
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night

296
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
without other people acting afraid of me.

297
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine

298
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous

299
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
can also kind of suck.

300
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
In my video on incels,

301
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps,

302
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
and how getting no attention at all

303
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
can actually be emotionally worse

304
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
than getting a lot of shitty attention.

305
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,240
And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,

306
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
when I was living as a man,

307
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
sometimes if I was walking at night,

308
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
a woman on the same block as me

309
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
would change sides of the street.

310
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
And I totally get why.

311
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Men do scary shit sometimes, and it's better to be safe.

312
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
But it still stung a little bit

313
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
to be treated as dangerous by default.

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I think it can actually be harmful,

315
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.

316
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
There's ways that white women's fear

317
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
can actually be dangerous, in particular, to black men.

318
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I had an experience with this recently

319
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,

320
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
and I'd rented a room in a hotel casino.

321
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment

322
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
up to my room, and I got into the elevator

323
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
with a group of people from the casino floor.

324
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,240
A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator

325
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
except for me and a single black man.

326
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Well, I mean, he was alone.

327
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
I don't know if he was single.

328
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
That's not part of the story.

329
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
And as soon as the door closed,

330
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
he started literally whistling

331
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
row, row, row your boat,

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
the official melody of performative innocence.

333
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,240
And I realized, oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid.

334
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
And I found that just excruciating.

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
I was like, oh god,

336
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
how do other white women behave in elevators?

337
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Do they like clutch their purses?

338
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing.

339
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Nothing like that had ever happened to me

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
when I was living as a man.

341
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
It's not a thing between black men and white men.

342
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,240
It's a thing between black men and white women.

343
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
And so that dynamic was there

344
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
not just because I'm white and he's black,

345
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
but because I'm a woman and he's a man.

346
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
And I thought of that incident again

347
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
when I was listening to the myth of male power,

348
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
and Farrell says,

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,240
men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength,

350
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.

351
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
I think there is some truth to the idea

352
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,240
that women's perceived vulnerability can make them powerful,

353
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

354
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt

355
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
because these are just some little observations I've made

356
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
based on a handful of anecdotes.

357
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
And as rational males,

358
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
it's important that we consider the facts,

359
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
the stats, and the figures.

360
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Did you know that 46% of men

361
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,240
are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?

362
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Look it up.

363
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
I haven't.

364
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
I guess my super fucking Libra opinion

365
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
is that there's upsides and downsides

366
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
to male and female experience.

367
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I don't actually think there's a single definite answer

368
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
to the vague and useless question,

369
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
which gender has it worse?

370
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I consider myself a feminist

371
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
because I support reproductive rights

372
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
and I oppose workplace misogyny,

373
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
and I generally agree with a lot of the activism

374
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,240
that happens under the heading of feminism.

375
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
But I also think a lot of men

376
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
are just having a super fucking difficult time right now,

377
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
and that must be super fucking hard for them, eh?

378
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
How are you?

379
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
And I don't think feminists

380
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
have an obligation to care about male ex,

381
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
but I care about you boys.

382
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
God, I'm such a cool girl,

383
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I think the entire mid-Atlantic region

384
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
is about to freeze over.

385
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,240
No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,

386
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
and I really try to understand other people's pain

387
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,240
because I just find it really, really funny.

388
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm also really, really sobering up here.

389
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
The drugs have worn off,

390
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,240
and I'm suddenly feeling very naked.

391
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Like, it's just now occurring to me

392
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,240
that this is a highly inappropriate outfit

393
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
for this occasion.

394
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
So, I'm gonna go put on a robe,

395
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
and I'll meet you back for the next section.

396
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Postulate three, the man question.

397
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Hi boys, et cetera, et cetera.

398
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Hey, how are you?

399
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
For the last three years on this channel,

400
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
I have been your Virgil,

401
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
leading you through gender hell.

402
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels,

403
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
radical feminists, non-binary genders,

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
men's rights activists.

405
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,240
It seems like everybody's having gender trouble,

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
so what do we make of that?

407
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Well, Gorge,

408
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel

409
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,240
once said that the unfolding of history

410
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
is a basically rational process, Gorge.

411
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,240
That means that at any time in history,

412
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
society is based on certain principles,

413
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
like all men are created equal

414
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
as long as they're super fucking rich and white.

415
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
And there's always contradictions within those principles

416
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
which creates tension

417
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,240
and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution,

418
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
where society has to be reorganized

419
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
according to new principles.

420
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
At least, I think he was saying something like that.

421
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
It's pretty hard to make anything out

422
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
through the fog of his unreadable,

423
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
hyper-abstract man jabbering.

424
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
God, I can't stand that shit,

425
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
or any of the other music-hating vol-cells

426
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
of the male philosophical tradition.

427
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
My point is, I think our society has reached a place

428
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.

429
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working

430
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
or how to fix it,

431
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
but we do all agree that it's broken.

432
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
We have mainstream feminists saying

433
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
we need to continue advancing the rights of women.

434
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
We have conservatives saying

435
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,240
we need to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.

436
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
We have an increasing number of people

437
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
not identifying as men or women.

438
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
We have TERFs who think that the transgenders

439
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
are the single greatest threat to civilization,

440
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
hey, how are you?

441
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
And we have men's rights activists saying

442
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
we need a male equivalent to feminism

443
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,240
to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.

444
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Now, I want to focus on that last one,

445
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,240
because in principle, I agree.

446
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
I've spent a lot of the last three years

447
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
covering the manosphere.

448
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.

449
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
And from all the time I've tortured myself

450
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
wading through these communities of incels,

451
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,

452
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
intellectual dark web fanboys, and alt-right racists,

453
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,

454
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
which is that they all recruit

455
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
from the same massive pool of sad young men.

456
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
We all know the Archetype.

457
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
He has trouble relating to women,

458
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
he has no strong friendship group,

459
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
he's not excited about any long-term goals,

460
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,240
and he fills the void with video games and porn.

461
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
And just to clarify,

462
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn,

463
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm not telling you what to do with your penis,

464
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
you can rub one out to this video for all I care,

465
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,240
just don't pull a gamer gate on me, okay?

466
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I live in fear.

467
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Look, I like to believe

468
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
that until the red pillars inject their poison,

469
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,240
most of these boys are not bad people.

470
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I think all of this originates

471
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
in a genuine crisis of male identity,

472
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
and I think it's happened in something

473
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,240
like the way men's rights activists describe.

474
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

475
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

476
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
The traditional protector-provider role of men

477
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
is being replaced by a more equal

478
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
and undefined gender dynamic.

479
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
And college professors and activists

480
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
are telling men that most of our culture's

481
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
aspirational representations of manhood

482
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
are toxic and bad.

483
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
But without an attractive replacement vision

484
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
of aspirational manhood,

485
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,240
average young men can only envision their future as...

486
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
what?

487
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
The beta.

488
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
The cock.

489
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
The new male.

490
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
And in a post-left-tube internet,

491
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

492
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
And to be fair, it is very funny.

493
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
But we forget, especially us grills,

494
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
that for a lot of men, these words actually do

495
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
tap into a deep existential angst.

496
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
And a lot of leftists go,

497
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
well how can men be so angsty?

498
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Especially white men, they're so privileged.

499
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,240
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

500
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
If you're actually being oppressed,

501
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
you have a struggle,

502
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
you have something to fight for,

503
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
and therefore, a purpose.

504
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
But for a lot of men,

505
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,240
their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.

506
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
And that, along with the loneliness

507
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
and the lack of a positive identity,

508
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

509
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

510
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

511
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,240
for the small but growing number of young men

512
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
who decide to pick up a gun

513
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,240
and open fire in a shopping center.

514
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
There were two mass shootings

515
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
during the weekend I was writing this video,

516
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
resulting in 31 deaths.

517
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Both shooters were young white men,

518
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
and one of them posted about the shooting

519
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
on an alt-right image board.

520
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Now I don't pretend to fully understand

521
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
the motives of mass shooters,

522
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
but I don't think it's a coincidence

523
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
that basically all of them are men.

524
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

525
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

526
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,

527
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men

528
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

529
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
And of course there's also the racism

530
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
of the alt-right killers,

531
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
and the wounded sexual entitlement

532
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
of the incel killers.

533
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

534
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

535
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
are more receptive to learning it.

536
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
So you can try to take down their forums

537
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,

538
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

539
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I don't see any end to these problems.

540
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Theorem four, what do?

541
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,240
There is this media narrative that has emerged

542
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
around me and around this channel.

543
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

544
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
of media narrative about this channel

545
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
is super fucking coconuts.

546
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Because let's be real, Gorge,

547
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I just wanted to pour milk on my face

548
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
and talk about the mouthfeel.

549
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
But there's this media narrative

550
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
that my role in the discourse is

551
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,240
de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

552
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
And it's true that if you read

553
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

554
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I used to be alt-right posts

555
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
are so common they're considered cliche.

556
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
And some of them cite me as an influence

557
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
in changing their politics,

558
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
which I love for them,

559
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
and I'm super fucking happy about it,

560
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,240
but it's also a lot of responsibility.

561
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
They're my boys,

562
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
and I worry about my boys.

563
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Because in reality,

564
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
it's not like they go from far-right extremists

565
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
to complacent centrists, no.

566
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Most of them go far left.

567
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

568
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
So I watch them go from far to my right

569
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
to significantly to my left.

570
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
It's not really de-radicalizing

571
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
so much as re-radicalizing.

572
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

573
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

574
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I worry about my boys,

575
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
because I don't think that the left yet

576
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,240
has a final solution to the man question.

577
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

578
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
You know, there's kind of two options

579
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
the left has for disillusioned men.

580
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
The first is the Marxist promise

581
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
of economic revolution.

582
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
We say, well, actually yes, you are oppressed,

583
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
but you're oppressed because of your class,

584
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
not your gender.

585
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
So just join the revolution,

586
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
it's gonna be super fucking crazy,

587
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
we're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie,

588
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
meow meow, smash, no voting,

589
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
and then things will be better for you.

590
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Now, I think that has a couple limitations.

591
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
One is that I look at the far left,

592
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
and I see a bunch of people

593
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
who spend all their time accusing each other

594
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
of abusing moderator privileges

595
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
in closed Facebook groups.

596
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
And I'm concerned that

597
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
we might not succeed at ending capitalism,

598
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
meow meow.

599
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Like, definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

600
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,

601
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
but if you're investing all of your hopes

602
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
in a capital R revolution,

603
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I worry that can become like waiting for Godot,

604
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
or waiting for the rapture.

605
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
So we do need political change,

606
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
but I feel like I'm failing

607
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
my boys

608
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

609
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
that revolution is their only hope.

610
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Because here's the other thing,

611
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
if we succeed ending capitalism,

612
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
there would still be gender,

613
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
and my boys would still need some model

614
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
of what it is to lead a good life

615
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
as a man.

616
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men

617
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
is the feminist tranquilizer.

618
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
We say, look, toxic masculinity

619
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings,

620
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
and it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.

621
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
So while feminism tells women

622
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
you hate your body and you're constantly

623
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
doubting yourself because society

624
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
did this to you and needs to change,

625
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
we kind of just tell men

626
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.

627
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Stop it.

628
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
We tell them they're broken without really telling them

629
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
how to fix themselves.

630
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
I think what we need is a new, positive

631
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
ideal of manhood,

632
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
which I don't think is something that women can create

633
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
for men, even if they wanted to.

634
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
And honestly, the best way for that to happen

635
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
may actually be some kind of men's movement.

636
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
But on the left, the whole idea

637
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
of a men's movement is basically taboo

638
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
because the men's movement we all know

639
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
is basically just a backlash to feminism.

640
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
And at worst,

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
it's just straight-up misogyny.

642
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
And look boys, I understand that being

643
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
lectured about manspreading for most of 2015

644
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
was super fucking hard for you

645
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
and you're still mad about it,

646
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
but posting endless outrage porn

647
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
about false rape accusations

648
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
and paternity fraud isn't actually

649
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
going to make life any better for you.

650
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Because yes, those things are horrible

651
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
when they happen, but they're not

652
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
systemic issues that affect most men.

653
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
I think what would actually improve life

654
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
for most men

655
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
is a positive ideal of

656
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
21st century manhood.

657
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
But that's not something I can give to you

658
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
because, in case you hadn't noticed,

659
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm literally a fucking woman.

660
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I can't mom you through this one, boys,

661
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
you're on your own. You have to help each other.

662
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
So find each other in the comments section,

663
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
meet up on Reddit,

664
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
make friends, clean your room,

665
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
leave the house. Fuck each other.

666
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
I don't know. It's worth a try.

667
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
And failing that,

668
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
you could always throw in the towel

669
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
and become a woman.

670
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Worked for me.

671
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Worked for me.

672
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm just trying to give, like,

673
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
milady energy.

674
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Yeah, it is English.

675
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
It's very John McClane, very Quentin Crisp,

676
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
very aristocrat.

677
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm super fucking naked right now.

678
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
That's crazy.

679
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
That's super fucking crazy.

680
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
According to traditional gender roles,

681
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
men are useful for their labor,

682
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
and women are useful for their wombs.

683
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Well, I'm a woman without a womb,

684
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
so I guess I'm useless.

685
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
But I'm beautifully useless.

686
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Ugh, I'm a work of art.

687
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
The problem with our society is we've turned

688
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
men into women. It's disgusting.

689
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
As an ally to men,

690
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
it's not my place to speak

691
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
for them or speak over them,

692
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
but I just want to use my platform

693
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
to uplift

694
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
some male voices who

695
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
might not have

696
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
as many subscribers as me.

697
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Okay.

698
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Meh.

699
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm not a

700
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
pergamos. I don't need a rich husband.

701
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
If I may quote Cher,

702
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
I don't need a rich man.

703
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
I am a rich man.

704
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
It's not even really much of an insult being called

705
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
a delusional man. Many great

706
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
books have been written by delusional men.

707
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
So bad.

708
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm bad.

709
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm really bad.

710
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Okay.
