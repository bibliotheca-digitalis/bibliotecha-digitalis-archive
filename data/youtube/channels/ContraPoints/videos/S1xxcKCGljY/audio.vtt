WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Hi boys, it's me again, just your average girl.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.160
Look I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video, we're able

00:14.160 --> 00:16.960
to converse as men.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.320
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

00:21.320 --> 00:23.160
now and the decline of Rome.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.520
Do you like history boys?

00:24.520 --> 00:25.960
How did Rome fall again?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.840
Was it the gays?

00:27.840 --> 00:29.240
Tell me all about it.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.200
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side and men's

00:34.200 --> 00:36.040
rights activists on the other.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
Whatever happened to that?

00:37.040 --> 00:42.440
These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.240
I did want to do the fedora though.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.200
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora and I

00:48.200 --> 00:50.440
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

00:50.440 --> 00:56.600
My wardrobe notes for this video say MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
School shooter realness.

00:57.760 --> 01:03.560
I feel like I'm also serving a little, oh, red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.640
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

01:08.640 --> 01:16.200
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.480
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

01:20.480 --> 01:22.680
in a state of psychological balance?

01:22.680 --> 01:26.120
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

01:26.120 --> 01:30.000
I guess, yeah, kind of, you don't see a whole lot of psyllium husk in heterosexual

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
medicine cabinets.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.120
I'm losing my target audience here.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.680
Listen, my dudes, let's just say I'm kind of worried about you guys.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.760
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.880
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.240
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.160
Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?

01:47.160 --> 01:48.160
Get over it.

01:48.160 --> 01:52.760
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I for one will not

01:52.760 --> 01:55.480
be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.160
ðŸŽµ

01:58.160 --> 02:02.120
Ugh, you boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

02:02.120 --> 02:04.360
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

02:04.360 --> 02:09.080
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with, both as a biological

02:09.080 --> 02:11.040
female and as a Pisces moon.

02:11.040 --> 02:16.240
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men, Contra Pines, for men, I started

02:16.240 --> 02:22.920
brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

02:22.920 --> 02:27.560
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica, Wittgenstein's Tractatus

02:27.560 --> 02:33.320
Logico-Philosophicus, and of course the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Calliante.

02:33.320 --> 02:38.980
So my mind is well-lubricated and I'm ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating

02:38.980 --> 02:42.520
intellectual interchange.

02:42.520 --> 02:47.440
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay, so there will be no emotions in this video.

02:47.440 --> 02:54.040
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form, relying only on facts, reason, evidence,

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
and deductive proof.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.040
ðŸ””

02:58.040 --> 03:00.040

03:00.040 --> 03:02.040

03:02.040 --> 03:04.040

03:04.040 --> 03:07.040
Actually, you know what?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Fuck that.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.040
Let's listen to house music and do sax frogs.

03:11.640 --> 03:26.640
ðŸ””

03:26.640 --> 03:28.640
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.640
ðŸ””

03:29.640 --> 03:30.640
Oh.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.640
And the male straights.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
ðŸ””

03:32.640 --> 03:33.640
God I love attention.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.640
Hey gorge.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.640
Hey gorge.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.640
Hey gorge.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.640
Okay I'm ready.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.640
Let's crack open a cold one boys.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
ðŸ””

03:42.240 --> 03:45.240
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.240
I need a man to do it for me.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
ðŸ””

03:48.240 --> 03:49.240
Heeeeeeelp.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.240
Fuck it.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.240
ðŸ””

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
Oh.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.240
Okay that's super fucking pretty.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.240
Hey gorge.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
Hey gorge.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.240
If there are any women still watching this video, I'm really sorry about all this.

03:59.240 --> 04:04.240
Unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case how very dare, I'm a good Presbyterian.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.240
And by Presbyterian I do mean pansexual, hey how are y'all.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.240
Look the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.240
Am I doing this right?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
Is this what men like?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
Straps.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.240
Straps.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.240
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

04:18.240 --> 04:23.240
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're gonna wind up somewhere on the Frank-N-Furter-Violet-Tchotchke-Di-Devanti's spectrum.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.240
Oh, but you don't know where exactly.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.240
And that is a dangerous game, ladies.

04:28.240 --> 04:33.240
I have to say though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.240
But um, that could be because of the drugs.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.240
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.240
And we're fooling around, okay?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
Part one.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.240
Oh wait, rational.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.240
Axiom one, America's next top victim.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.240
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.240
And I'm not just talking about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.240
No bitch, this goes all the way to the top.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.240
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

05:04.240 --> 05:11.240
We have the literal 1% complaining about anti-rich prejudice.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.240
That must be super fucking hard for you.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.240
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

05:18.240 --> 05:23.240
You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family

05:23.240 --> 05:26.240
and protesting in the street like a bunch of f***ers.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.240
And so of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.240
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,

05:33.240 --> 05:35.240
and I've always been very skeptical.

05:35.240 --> 05:40.240
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.240
Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,

05:43.240 --> 05:45.240
and then a man shows up to say,

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
well what about men?

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
Men also get harassed.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.240
Why aren't you talking about men?

05:50.240 --> 05:55.240
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

05:55.240 --> 05:57.240
Of course he's fucking not.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.240
He doesn't give a shit.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
He's a troll.

06:00.240 --> 06:05.240
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.240
What about them, honey?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.240
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once,

06:09.240 --> 06:13.240
and the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,

06:13.240 --> 06:16.240
which is The Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

06:16.240 --> 06:20.240
Actually I listened to the audiobook, because let's be honest, reading is hard.

06:20.240 --> 06:25.240
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.240
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
that confined women to domestic servitude.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.240
But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society

06:36.240 --> 06:41.240
is actually an illusion, because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.240
He introduces the idea of male disposability,

06:44.240 --> 06:49.240
basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,

06:49.240 --> 06:54.240
which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.240
He points to statistics showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

06:58.240 --> 07:02.240
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.240
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,

07:07.240 --> 07:13.240
in fact the queens have a certain kind of privilege in being protected and provided for

07:13.240 --> 07:16.240
by the expendable male worker bees.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.240
And I guess that kind of makes sense.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.240
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

07:21.240 --> 07:27.240
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill, and I rubbed it on my cluuuuuuuuuuut.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.240
But some initial objections come to mind.

07:30.240 --> 07:35.240
Like haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?

07:35.240 --> 07:38.240
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

07:38.240 --> 07:41.240
I dunno boys, still seems kinda patriarchal to me.

07:41.240 --> 07:47.240
But maybe he'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.

07:47.240 --> 07:53.240
Maybe the average man is also oppressed by this system that feminists call patriarchy.

07:53.240 --> 07:57.240
If that's what you're saying, I think I basically agree with that.

07:57.240 --> 08:02.240
See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

08:04.240 --> 08:08.240
well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,

08:08.240 --> 08:13.240
and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuuuuuuuuuuts.

08:13.240 --> 08:17.240
But no, my Scorpio-rising persona will not allow that.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.240
Oh, there will be a champion.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
There will be blood.

08:20.240 --> 08:26.240
So, judges, how do we decide which gender is America's next top victim?

08:26.240 --> 08:31.240
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.240
Or can you?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.240
Proposition 2.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.240
Diary of an X-Man.

08:37.240 --> 08:44.240
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.240
Mom!

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
Get out of my room!

08:48.240 --> 08:49.240
You're ruining my life!

08:49.240 --> 08:54.240
Look, I've never, ever talked about this on my channel before,

08:54.240 --> 08:57.240
so this is like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

08:57.240 --> 08:59.240
but I was born a boy.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.240
Well, was I ever really a boy?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.240
It's hard to say.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.240
Dear diary, growing up I always knew that I was different from other kids,

09:07.240 --> 09:09.240
especially other boys,

09:09.240 --> 09:12.240
and it took me so long to pinpoint what it was,

09:12.240 --> 09:15.240
but there was this moment.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.240
I must have been, what, 7, 8 years old?

09:18.240 --> 09:21.240
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself,

09:21.240 --> 09:25.240
and I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor,

09:25.240 --> 09:27.240
and I don't know what it was,

09:27.240 --> 09:30.240
it was like this magnetism that drew me to them.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.240
And I put my little feet in them,

09:32.240 --> 09:34.240
and walked in front of the mirror,

09:34.240 --> 09:38.240
and I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt,

09:38.240 --> 09:41.240
but basically in that moment,

09:41.240 --> 09:43.240
I sensed that God had made a mistake,

09:43.240 --> 09:46.240
and I was destined to be,

09:46.240 --> 09:49.240
to be a crossdresser.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.240
That is super fucking coconuts.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.240
Anyway, then in my 20s my life completely fell apart,

09:56.240 --> 09:57.240
and I became a woman, hey how are you?

09:57.240 --> 09:59.240
I became one of the dolls.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.240
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.240
Look boys, the point I'm trying to make here is,

10:03.240 --> 10:05.240
I used to live your lifestyle.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.240
I know what people like you get up to,

10:07.240 --> 10:09.240
and I think it's disgusting.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.240
I gotta say though, since I transitioned,

10:11.240 --> 10:13.240
my life has been super fucking great.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
Like, way better.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.240
Now of course a lot of that is not because women have it better than men,

10:17.240 --> 10:22.240
but because, hey gorge, I am literally transgendered.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.240
So before I transitioned, I was dying inside, you know?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.240
I was in the wrong body.

10:27.240 --> 10:32.240
And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.240
But it's not just that.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.240
I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,

10:37.240 --> 10:39.240
people actually do treat me better.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.240
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure,

10:42.240 --> 10:45.240
but that's probably for the best.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.240
Now before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,

10:48.240 --> 10:50.240
I guess I should say a couple caveats.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.240
Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are not like other boys,

10:55.240 --> 10:59.240
and most of us were not living the business-class male experience by any means.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.240
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics, tormented sissies,

11:03.240 --> 11:09.240
secretive transvestites, poets, you know, that sort of thing.

11:09.240 --> 11:14.240
Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience,

11:14.240 --> 11:19.240
and I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me, hey how are you.

11:20.240 --> 11:25.240
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually just bragging?

11:25.240 --> 11:29.240
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful,

11:29.240 --> 11:33.240
and I've come so far, in part because I'm white, and I'm skinny,

11:33.240 --> 11:37.240
and I'm young, and I'm blonde, and I'm rich, and I pass,

11:37.240 --> 11:42.240
and I'm educated, and I'm popular, and my plastic surgeon is an artist,

11:42.240 --> 11:46.240
and my boyfriend is really rich and hot, and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.240
And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate

11:49.240 --> 11:53.240
is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have

11:53.240 --> 11:58.240
that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.240
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,

12:00.240 --> 12:04.240
that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.240
What I was saying is, there are ways that people treat me better now

12:07.240 --> 12:09.240
that I'm presenting as a woman.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.240
You know, people smile at me more, I feel more taken care of,

12:12.240 --> 12:14.240
men do things for me.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.240
Now a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.240
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

12:19.240 --> 12:23.240
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
But not me.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.240
I love it, both because I love attention,

12:27.240 --> 12:29.240
and because I'm a recumbent queen

12:29.240 --> 12:32.240
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.240
I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me

12:34.240 --> 12:36.240
to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,

12:36.240 --> 12:39.240
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift,

12:39.240 --> 12:43.240
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me,

12:43.240 --> 12:45.240
even though I'm taller than most men.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.240
It makes me happy.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.240
Another good thing about becoming a woman is

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240
I integrated into female social groups,

12:50.240 --> 12:53.240
and I found that they provide a kind of communal support

12:53.240 --> 12:58.240
and overt affection that male social groups generally just don't.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.240
I find the female social style suits me better than the male one,

13:01.240 --> 13:04.240
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist,

13:04.240 --> 13:06.240
where affection is always concealed

13:06.240 --> 13:09.240
behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.240
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
when they play video games.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.240
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

13:15.240 --> 13:17.240
men and women are treated in public space.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.240
When you present female in public,

13:19.240 --> 13:22.240
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
to be commented upon.

13:23.240 --> 13:28.240
People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about you,

13:28.240 --> 13:30.240
sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting,

13:30.240 --> 13:33.240
sometimes just fucking weird.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.240
Whereas, when you present male in public,

13:35.240 --> 13:39.240
you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.240
Now feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences

13:42.240 --> 13:45.240
as men asserting dominance over women in public space,

13:45.240 --> 13:48.240
and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying,

13:48.240 --> 13:50.240
degrading, and misogynistic.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.240
And it certainly can be all of those things.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.240
But there's different kinds of catcalling,

13:54.240 --> 13:56.240
and I have different feelings about them.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.240
If I'm walking with another woman,

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
and a man says,

13:59.240 --> 14:01.240
ladies, you look beautiful tonight.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
I don't know, I like that.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
I think that's nice.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.240
It makes me feel seen, it makes me feel admired.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
It boosts my confidence.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.240
Whereas, if I'm walking alone,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.240
and a drunk starts following me down the street,

14:13.240 --> 14:14.240
singing,

14:14.240 --> 14:16.240
have you seen a polythene pam?

14:16.240 --> 14:19.240
She's so good looking, but she looks like a man.

14:19.240 --> 14:23.240
That, I am less enthusiastic about.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.240
I mean, not that that's ever happened.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.240
I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey how are you.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.240
No one knows what it's like

14:31.240 --> 14:34.240
to be a sad tram.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.240
I definitely get where feminists are coming from,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.240
because street harassment sucks.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.240
I'm a lot more afraid walking alone at night

14:40.240 --> 14:41.240
than I used to be,

14:41.240 --> 14:44.240
and there's a lot more places I just won't go by myself.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.240
But on the other hand,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.240
I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night

14:49.240 --> 14:51.240
without other people acting afraid of me.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.240
I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine

14:54.240 --> 14:57.240
the ways that being treated as invisible or dangerous

14:57.240 --> 15:00.240
can also kind of suck.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.240
In my video on incels,

15:01.240 --> 15:04.240
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.240
and how getting no attention at all

15:06.240 --> 15:08.240
can actually be emotionally worse

15:08.240 --> 15:10.240
than getting a lot of shitty attention.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.240
And when it comes to being treated as dangerous,

15:13.240 --> 15:15.240
when I was living as a man,

15:15.240 --> 15:17.240
sometimes if I was walking at night,

15:17.240 --> 15:19.240
a woman on the same block as me

15:19.240 --> 15:21.240
would change sides of the street.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.240
And I totally get why.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.240
Men do scary shit sometimes, and it's better to be safe.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.240
But it still stung a little bit

15:28.240 --> 15:31.240
to be treated as dangerous by default.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.240
I think it can actually be harmful,

15:33.240 --> 15:36.240
which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.240
There's ways that white women's fear

15:38.240 --> 15:42.240
can actually be dangerous, in particular, to black men.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
I had an experience with this recently

15:43.240 --> 15:45.240
when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,

15:45.240 --> 15:47.240
and I'd rented a room in a hotel casino.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.240
Around midnight, I was carrying some camera equipment

15:50.240 --> 15:52.240
up to my room, and I got into the elevator

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
with a group of people from the casino floor.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.240
A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator

15:57.240 --> 16:00.240
except for me and a single black man.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.240
Well, I mean, he was alone.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.240
I don't know if he was single.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.240
That's not part of the story.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.240
And as soon as the door closed,

16:05.240 --> 16:07.240
he started literally whistling

16:07.240 --> 16:09.240
row, row, row your boat,

16:09.240 --> 16:11.240
the official melody of performative innocence.

16:11.240 --> 16:16.240
And I realized, oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.240
And I found that just excruciating.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.240
I was like, oh god,

16:20.240 --> 16:23.240
how do other white women behave in elevators?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.240
Do they like clutch their purses?

16:26.240 --> 16:29.240
Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.240
Nothing like that had ever happened to me

16:31.240 --> 16:32.240
when I was living as a man.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.240
It's not a thing between black men and white men.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.240
It's a thing between black men and white women.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.240
And so that dynamic was there

16:39.240 --> 16:41.240
not just because I'm white and he's black,

16:41.240 --> 16:44.240
but because I'm a woman and he's a man.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.240
And I thought of that incident again

16:46.240 --> 16:48.240
when I was listening to the myth of male power,

16:48.240 --> 16:49.240
and Farrell says,

16:49.240 --> 16:52.240
men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength,

16:52.240 --> 16:56.240
and women's greatest strength is their facade of weakness.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.240
I think there is some truth to the idea

16:58.240 --> 17:01.240
that women's perceived vulnerability can make them powerful,

17:01.240 --> 17:04.240
and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.240
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt

17:06.240 --> 17:09.240
because these are just some little observations I've made

17:09.240 --> 17:11.240
based on a handful of anecdotes.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.240
And as rational males,

17:13.240 --> 17:15.240
it's important that we consider the facts,

17:15.240 --> 17:17.240
the stats, and the figures.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.240
Did you know that 46% of men

17:20.240 --> 17:25.240
are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women?

17:26.240 --> 17:27.240
Look it up.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.240
I haven't.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.240
I guess my super fucking Libra opinion

17:30.240 --> 17:32.240
is that there's upsides and downsides

17:32.240 --> 17:34.240
to male and female experience.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.240
I don't actually think there's a single definite answer

17:36.240 --> 17:38.240
to the vague and useless question,

17:38.240 --> 17:40.240
which gender has it worse?

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
I consider myself a feminist

17:41.240 --> 17:43.240
because I support reproductive rights

17:43.240 --> 17:45.240
and I oppose workplace misogyny,

17:45.240 --> 17:47.240
and I generally agree with a lot of the activism

17:47.240 --> 17:50.240
that happens under the heading of feminism.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.240
But I also think a lot of men

17:51.240 --> 17:54.240
are just having a super fucking difficult time right now,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
and that must be super fucking hard for them, eh?

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
How are you?

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
And I don't think feminists

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
have an obligation to care about male ex,

18:00.240 --> 18:03.240
but I care about you boys.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
God, I'm such a cool girl,

18:04.240 --> 18:06.240
I think the entire mid-Atlantic region

18:06.240 --> 18:07.240
is about to freeze over.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.240
No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,

18:10.240 --> 18:13.240
and I really try to understand other people's pain

18:13.240 --> 18:18.240
because I just find it really, really funny.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.240
I'm also really, really sobering up here.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.240
The drugs have worn off,

18:23.240 --> 18:27.240
and I'm suddenly feeling very naked.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
Like, it's just now occurring to me

18:29.240 --> 18:32.240
that this is a highly inappropriate outfit

18:32.240 --> 18:33.240
for this occasion.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
So, I'm gonna go put on a robe,

18:36.240 --> 18:39.240
and I'll meet you back for the next section.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.240
Postulate three, the man question.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.240
Hi boys, et cetera, et cetera.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.240
Hey, how are you?

18:51.240 --> 18:53.240
For the last three years on this channel,

18:53.240 --> 18:55.240
I have been your Virgil,

18:55.240 --> 18:57.240
leading you through gender hell.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.240
Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels,

19:00.240 --> 19:03.240
radical feminists, non-binary genders,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.240
men's rights activists.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.240
It seems like everybody's having gender trouble,

19:07.240 --> 19:09.240
so what do we make of that?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.240
Well, Gorge,

19:10.240 --> 19:14.240
a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel

19:14.240 --> 19:17.240
once said that the unfolding of history

19:17.240 --> 19:19.240
is a basically rational process, Gorge.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.240
That means that at any time in history,

19:22.240 --> 19:24.240
society is based on certain principles,

19:24.240 --> 19:27.240
like all men are created equal

19:27.240 --> 19:29.240
as long as they're super fucking rich and white.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.240
And there's always contradictions within those principles

19:32.240 --> 19:34.240
which creates tension

19:34.240 --> 19:37.240
and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution,

19:37.240 --> 19:39.240
where society has to be reorganized

19:39.240 --> 19:40.240
according to new principles.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.240
At least, I think he was saying something like that.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.240
It's pretty hard to make anything out

19:44.240 --> 19:46.240
through the fog of his unreadable,

19:46.240 --> 19:47.240
hyper-abstract man jabbering.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.240
God, I can't stand that shit,

19:49.240 --> 19:51.240
or any of the other music-hating vol-cells

19:51.240 --> 19:53.240
of the male philosophical tradition.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.240
My point is, I think our society has reached a place

19:56.240 --> 19:59.240
where gender as we know it just isn't working anymore.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.240
Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
or how to fix it,

20:02.240 --> 20:04.240
but we do all agree that it's broken.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.240
We have mainstream feminists saying

20:06.240 --> 20:08.240
we need to continue advancing the rights of women.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
We have conservatives saying

20:09.240 --> 20:12.240
we need to restore the gender roles of the 1950s.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.240
We have an increasing number of people

20:13.240 --> 20:15.240
not identifying as men or women.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.240
We have TERFs who think that the transgenders

20:17.240 --> 20:19.240
are the single greatest threat to civilization,

20:19.240 --> 20:20.240
hey, how are you?

20:20.240 --> 20:22.240
And we have men's rights activists saying

20:22.240 --> 20:24.240
we need a male equivalent to feminism

20:24.240 --> 20:27.240
to liberate men from their oppressive gender role.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.240
Now, I want to focus on that last one,

20:29.240 --> 20:32.240
because in principle, I agree.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.240
I've spent a lot of the last three years

20:33.240 --> 20:35.240
covering the manosphere.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.240
I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.240
And from all the time I've tortured myself

20:39.240 --> 20:41.240
wading through these communities of incels,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.240
pickup artists, men's rights slacktivists,

20:44.240 --> 20:47.240
intellectual dark web fanboys, and alt-right racists,

20:47.240 --> 20:51.240
I've noticed that they all have one thing in common,

20:51.240 --> 20:52.240
which is that they all recruit

20:52.240 --> 20:56.240
from the same massive pool of sad young men.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.240
We all know the Archetype.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.240
He has trouble relating to women,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.240
he has no strong friendship group,

21:01.240 --> 21:03.240
he's not excited about any long-term goals,

21:03.240 --> 21:06.240
and he fills the void with video games and porn.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
And just to clarify,

21:07.240 --> 21:09.240
I'm not trying to take away your video games and porn,

21:09.240 --> 21:11.240
I'm not telling you what to do with your penis,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.240
you can rub one out to this video for all I care,

21:13.240 --> 21:16.240
just don't pull a gamer gate on me, okay?

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
I live in fear.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
Look, I like to believe

21:19.240 --> 21:22.240
that until the red pillars inject their poison,

21:22.240 --> 21:25.240
most of these boys are not bad people.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
I think all of this originates

21:26.240 --> 21:28.240
in a genuine crisis of male identity,

21:28.240 --> 21:30.240
and I think it's happened in something

21:30.240 --> 21:33.240
like the way men's rights activists describe.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.240
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

21:35.240 --> 21:38.240
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.240
The traditional protector-provider role of men

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
is being replaced by a more equal

21:42.240 --> 21:44.240
and undefined gender dynamic.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.240
And college professors and activists

21:46.240 --> 21:48.240
are telling men that most of our culture's

21:48.240 --> 21:50.240
aspirational representations of manhood

21:50.240 --> 21:52.240
are toxic and bad.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.240
But without an attractive replacement vision

21:54.240 --> 21:56.240
of aspirational manhood,

21:56.240 --> 21:59.240
average young men can only envision their future as...

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
what?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.240
The beta.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
The cock.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.240
The new male.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
And in a post-left-tube internet,

22:06.240 --> 22:08.240
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.240
And to be fair, it is very funny.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.240
But we forget, especially us grills,

22:13.240 --> 22:15.240
that for a lot of men, these words actually do

22:15.240 --> 22:18.240
tap into a deep existential angst.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
And a lot of leftists go,

22:19.240 --> 22:21.240
well how can men be so angsty?

22:21.240 --> 22:24.240
Especially white men, they're so privileged.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.240
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.240
If you're actually being oppressed,

22:30.240 --> 22:31.240
you have a struggle,

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
you have something to fight for,

22:33.240 --> 22:35.240
and therefore, a purpose.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.240
But for a lot of men,

22:36.240 --> 22:39.240
their lack of purpose puts them in search of a struggle.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.240
And that, along with the loneliness

22:42.240 --> 22:44.240
and the lack of a positive identity,

22:44.240 --> 22:46.240
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

22:46.240 --> 22:48.240
by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.240
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

22:51.240 --> 22:54.240
for the small but growing number of young men

22:54.240 --> 22:55.240
who decide to pick up a gun

22:55.240 --> 22:58.240
and open fire in a shopping center.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.240
There were two mass shootings

22:59.240 --> 23:01.240
during the weekend I was writing this video,

23:01.240 --> 23:03.240
resulting in 31 deaths.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.240
Both shooters were young white men,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.240
and one of them posted about the shooting

23:07.240 --> 23:08.240
on an alt-right image board.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.240
Now I don't pretend to fully understand

23:10.240 --> 23:11.240
the motives of mass shooters,

23:11.240 --> 23:13.240
but I don't think it's a coincidence

23:13.240 --> 23:15.240
that basically all of them are men.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.240
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

23:18.240 --> 23:21.240
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

23:21.240 --> 23:24.240
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,

23:24.240 --> 23:28.240
and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men

23:28.240 --> 23:31.240
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.240
And of course there's also the racism

23:33.240 --> 23:34.240
of the alt-right killers,

23:34.240 --> 23:36.240
and the wounded sexual entitlement

23:36.240 --> 23:37.240
of the incel killers.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.240
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

23:40.240 --> 23:43.240
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

23:43.240 --> 23:45.240
are more receptive to learning it.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.240
So you can try to take down their forums

23:48.240 --> 23:50.240
and ban their accounts and deplatform their events,

23:50.240 --> 23:54.240
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

23:54.240 --> 23:57.240
I don't see any end to these problems.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.240
Theorem four, what do?

23:59.240 --> 24:02.240
There is this media narrative that has emerged

24:02.240 --> 24:04.240
around me and around this channel.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.240
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

24:06.240 --> 24:08.240
of media narrative about this channel

24:08.240 --> 24:10.240
is super fucking coconuts.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.240
Because let's be real, Gorge,

24:12.240 --> 24:14.240
I just wanted to pour milk on my face

24:14.240 --> 24:15.240
and talk about the mouthfeel.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.240
But there's this media narrative

24:17.240 --> 24:19.240
that my role in the discourse is

24:19.240 --> 24:23.240
de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.240
And it's true that if you read

24:25.240 --> 24:27.240
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
I used to be alt-right posts

24:29.240 --> 24:31.240
are so common they're considered cliche.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.240
And some of them cite me as an influence

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
in changing their politics,

24:36.240 --> 24:38.240
which I love for them,

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
and I'm super fucking happy about it,

24:40.240 --> 24:43.240
but it's also a lot of responsibility.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.240
They're my boys,

24:45.240 --> 24:47.240
and I worry about my boys.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.240
Because in reality,

24:49.240 --> 24:51.240
it's not like they go from far-right extremists

24:51.240 --> 24:53.240
to complacent centrists, no.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.240
Most of them go far left.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.240
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.240
So I watch them go from far to my right

24:59.240 --> 25:01.240
to significantly to my left.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.240
It's not really de-radicalizing

25:03.240 --> 25:05.240
so much as re-radicalizing.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.240
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

25:07.240 --> 25:09.240
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.240
I worry about my boys,

25:11.240 --> 25:13.240
because I don't think that the left yet

25:13.240 --> 25:16.240
has a final solution to the man question.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.240
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.240
You know, there's kind of two options

25:20.240 --> 25:22.240
the left has for disillusioned men.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.240
The first is the Marxist promise

25:24.240 --> 25:26.240
of economic revolution.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.240
We say, well, actually yes, you are oppressed,

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
but you're oppressed because of your class,

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
not your gender.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.240
So just join the revolution,

25:34.240 --> 25:36.240
it's gonna be super fucking crazy,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
we're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie,

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
meow meow, smash, no voting,

25:40.240 --> 25:42.240
and then things will be better for you.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.240
Now, I think that has a couple limitations.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.240
One is that I look at the far left,

25:46.240 --> 25:48.240
and I see a bunch of people

25:48.240 --> 25:50.240
who spend all their time accusing each other

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
of abusing moderator privileges

25:52.240 --> 25:54.240
in closed Facebook groups.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.240
And I'm concerned that

25:56.240 --> 25:58.240
we might not succeed at ending capitalism,

25:58.240 --> 26:00.240
meow meow.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.240
Like, definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

26:02.240 --> 26:04.240
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever,

26:04.240 --> 26:06.240
but if you're investing all of your hopes

26:06.240 --> 26:08.240
in a capital R revolution,

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
I worry that can become like waiting for Godot,

26:10.240 --> 26:12.240
or waiting for the rapture.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.240
So we do need political change,

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
but I feel like I'm failing

26:16.240 --> 26:18.240
my boys

26:18.240 --> 26:20.240
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

26:20.240 --> 26:22.240
that revolution is their only hope.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.240
Because here's the other thing,

26:24.240 --> 26:26.240
if we succeed ending capitalism,

26:26.240 --> 26:28.240
there would still be gender,

26:28.240 --> 26:30.240
and my boys would still need some model

26:30.240 --> 26:32.240
of what it is to lead a good life

26:32.240 --> 26:34.240
as a man.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.240
Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men

26:36.240 --> 26:38.240
is the feminist tranquilizer.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.240
We say, look, toxic masculinity

26:40.240 --> 26:42.240
is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings,

26:42.240 --> 26:44.240
and it's the reason you feel lonely and inadequate.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.240
So while feminism tells women

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
you hate your body and you're constantly

26:48.240 --> 26:50.240
doubting yourself because society

26:50.240 --> 26:52.240
did this to you and needs to change,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.240
we kind of just tell men

26:54.240 --> 26:56.240
you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.240
Stop it.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.240
We tell them they're broken without really telling them

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
how to fix themselves.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
I think what we need is a new, positive

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
ideal of manhood,

27:06.240 --> 27:08.240
which I don't think is something that women can create

27:08.240 --> 27:10.240
for men, even if they wanted to.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.240
And honestly, the best way for that to happen

27:12.240 --> 27:14.240
may actually be some kind of men's movement.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.240
But on the left, the whole idea

27:16.240 --> 27:18.240
of a men's movement is basically taboo

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
because the men's movement we all know

27:20.240 --> 27:22.240
is basically just a backlash to feminism.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.240
And at worst,

27:24.240 --> 27:26.240
it's just straight-up misogyny.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.240
And look boys, I understand that being

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
lectured about manspreading for most of 2015

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
was super fucking hard for you

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
and you're still mad about it,

27:34.240 --> 27:36.240
but posting endless outrage porn

27:36.240 --> 27:38.240
about false rape accusations

27:38.240 --> 27:40.240
and paternity fraud isn't actually

27:40.240 --> 27:42.240
going to make life any better for you.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
Because yes, those things are horrible

27:44.240 --> 27:46.240
when they happen, but they're not

27:46.240 --> 27:48.240
systemic issues that affect most men.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.240
I think what would actually improve life

27:50.240 --> 27:52.240
for most men

27:52.240 --> 27:54.240
is a positive ideal of

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
21st century manhood.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.240
But that's not something I can give to you

27:58.240 --> 28:00.240
because, in case you hadn't noticed,

28:00.240 --> 28:02.240
I'm literally a fucking woman.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
I can't mom you through this one, boys,

28:04.240 --> 28:06.240
you're on your own. You have to help each other.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.240
So find each other in the comments section,

28:08.240 --> 28:10.240
meet up on Reddit,

28:10.240 --> 28:12.240
make friends, clean your room,

28:12.240 --> 28:14.240
leave the house. Fuck each other.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.240
I don't know. It's worth a try.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.240
And failing that,

28:18.240 --> 28:20.240
you could always throw in the towel

28:20.240 --> 28:22.240
and become a woman.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.240
Worked for me.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.240
Worked for me.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
I'm just trying to give, like,

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
milady energy.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.240
Yeah, it is English.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.240
It's very John McClane, very Quentin Crisp,

29:24.240 --> 29:26.240
very aristocrat.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.240
I'm super fucking naked right now.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.240
That's crazy.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.240
That's super fucking crazy.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
According to traditional gender roles,

29:34.240 --> 29:36.240
men are useful for their labor,

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
and women are useful for their wombs.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.240
Well, I'm a woman without a womb,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.240
so I guess I'm useless.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.240
But I'm beautifully useless.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.240
Ugh, I'm a work of art.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.240
The problem with our society is we've turned

29:48.240 --> 29:50.240
men into women. It's disgusting.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.240
As an ally to men,

29:52.240 --> 29:54.240
it's not my place to speak

29:54.240 --> 29:56.240
for them or speak over them,

29:56.240 --> 29:58.240
but I just want to use my platform

29:58.240 --> 30:00.240
to uplift

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
some male voices who

30:02.240 --> 30:04.240
might not have

30:04.240 --> 30:06.240
as many subscribers as me.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.240
Okay.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.240
Meh.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.240
I'm not a

30:12.240 --> 30:14.240
pergamos. I don't need a rich husband.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.240
If I may quote Cher,

30:16.240 --> 30:18.240
I don't need a rich man.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.240
I am a rich man.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
It's not even really much of an insult being called

30:22.240 --> 30:24.240
a delusional man. Many great

30:24.240 --> 30:26.240
books have been written by delusional men.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.240
So bad.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.240
I'm bad.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.240
