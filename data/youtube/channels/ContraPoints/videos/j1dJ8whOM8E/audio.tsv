0	10800	Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation.
10800	12720	Welcome to my world.
12720	15720	Every week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials.
15720	16720	Come get ready with me.
16720	23240	So I'm going to go in with the color snowflake from my winter rose palette using a flaunt
23240	24240	325 brush.
24240	25240	Smoke it out.
25240	28240	You want to just kind of zhuzh it.
28240	29680	That looks bomb.
29680	30680	It's major.
30680	31680	I'm vibing it.
31680	32680	I'm obsessed.
32680	33680	It's literally snatched.
33680	34680	Love, love, love.
34680	35680	Yes.
35680	36680	Okay.
36680	37680	I'm not living for it.
37680	38680	Oh my god.
38680	39680	I think I glued my eye shut.
39680	40680	Fuck.
40680	41680	But I'm not just a pretty face.
41680	42680	I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.
42680	43680	Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim, because I prefer to take control of my own
43680	44680	life.
44680	45680	I'm a woman.
45680	46680	I'm a woman.
46680	47680	I'm a woman.
47680	48680	I'm a woman.
48680	49680	I'm a woman.
49680	50680	I'm a woman.
50680	51680	I'm a woman.
51680	52680	I'm a woman.
52680	53680	I'm a woman.
53680	54680	I'm a woman.
54680	55680	I'm a woman.
55680	56680	I'm a woman.
56680	57680	I'm a woman.
57680	58680	I'm a woman.
58680	59680	I'm a woman.
59680	60680	I'm a woman.
60680	61680	But I still prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our President
61680	63600	Donald J. Trump.
63600	66800	Make traps gay again.
66800	68160	Bye.
68160	69380	Hi.
69380	73520	I'm Jacky Jackson.
73520	92440	Host of the Freedom Report, where I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese drag
92440	95720	queen redecorated in an Italian bordello?
95720	98000	It's hard to move past it.
98000	102880	Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political
102880	107440	spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate
107440	114880	about a timeless question.
114880	115960	Are traps gay?
115960	121360	My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.
121360	122360	Clarence.
122360	124640	Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria.
124640	129440	Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?
129440	130760	Okay.
130760	134440	My other guest is returning to the show, it's Tiffany Tumbles.
134440	137560	Now Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this
137560	139120	program, isn't that right?
139120	140120	That's right, Jacky.
140120	143600	It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.
143600	144600	You poor thing.
144600	148080	Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?
148080	152180	Well I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders, and how I was tired
152180	157280	of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I
157280	161200	know everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?
161200	162200	I'm out.
162200	164760	I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.
164760	167240	I think that's just so brave of you.
167240	171520	Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.
171520	172520	Shut up, Adria.
172520	177520	I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that,
177520	181560	the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support, nothing.
181560	182760	I was absolutely alone.
182760	185260	Do you have any idea what that felt like?
185260	187980	Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria.
187980	190020	One wrong move and you're dead to them.
190020	191020	Those are not friends.
191020	193180	Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.
193180	197140	I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals who are
197140	201460	finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against politically
201460	202460	correct dogma.
202460	206380	Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?
206380	212300	So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow, till I'm
212300	214500	literally blinding.
214500	215500	I am glowing.
215500	220180	Mmm, she's doing alright, but I'm not living for it.
220180	223780	You know what else I'm not living for?
223780	224780	The Muslims.
224780	227140	Tiffany, you are so funny.
227140	230020	I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?
230020	231580	How is that racist?
231580	233060	Muslim's a religion, not a race.
233060	235780	Yeah, Adria, Muslim's a religion, not a race.
235780	239180	Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.
239180	240180	You can't just...
240180	242780	Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.
242780	244420	Let's try to get back on track here.
244420	247820	So, Adria, traps.
247820	248820	Are they gay?
248820	252060	Look, there's so many things wrong with the question that the only way to answer it is
252060	253620	to deconstruct it.
253620	255260	First of all, what are traps?
255260	256260	Are they trans women?
256260	259540	Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing into the lie
259540	264220	that trans women are tricking or trapping men, a lie that reinforces the mentality that
264220	265700	causes men to murder us.
265700	268580	Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.
268580	269580	What about anime?
269580	273220	Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.
273220	277660	The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser, there's no implication
277660	278660	of tricking men.
278660	283180	But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women, so when you
283180	286980	tell us that's not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us, because we've all heard
286980	287980	it used as a slur.
287980	290300	Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.
290300	292140	We're not all offended all the time.
292140	294500	I actually happen to identify as a trap.
294500	296860	Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap.
296860	298900	Well, she's in the sunken place.
298900	300700	And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.
300700	303980	Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you, his defense is gonna be,
303980	307860	well, she was a trap, I was tricked, and you'll have contributed to that way of thinking?
307860	308860	Well, what do you care, Adria?
308860	311340	No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.
311340	312340	Ooh, spicy.
312340	313940	The fuck did you just say?
313940	317140	I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.
317140	320020	Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?
320020	322900	Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.
322900	325860	Look, dragging bitches is what I do.
325860	327180	Facts over feels, hunty.
327180	329660	Wow, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?
329740	333260	Like, if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in.
333260	335420	I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?
335420	337500	How are you gonna attract men with that?
337500	339500	I'm not trying to attract men.
339500	340460	I'm a lesbian.
340460	346780	I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?
346780	349740	Well, I'm a woman, and I like women.
349740	351100	I don't know about that.
351100	352140	Sounds debatable.
352140	355420	I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the
355420	356780	transphobia special.
356780	358380	Transphobia?
358460	360780	Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.
360780	365500	I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program, and I'll have you know that
365500	368540	one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.
368540	371100	And what could be transphobic about that?
371100	374220	See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans people.
374220	377580	You're obnoxious and offended by everything, and everyone feels like they have to trot
377580	378780	on eggshells around you.
378780	379740	Thank you, Tiffany.
379740	381340	See, you're one of the good ones.
381340	382300	You're a good tran.
382300	384540	Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany?
384540	386620	Be the lapdog of people like this?
386620	387180	No.
387180	391820	I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient, and agreeable,
391820	395660	and by looking the part, and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet
395660	397340	your impossible standard of wokeness.
397340	400140	And you're going to do that by identifying as a trap, huh?
400140	403740	Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away.
403740	407020	Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany, that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone
407020	410220	but yourself, and the only reason you're accepted is that you don't challenge the
410220	410940	status quo?
410940	414140	I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because I feel like we're just
414140	415980	getting hung up on terminology.
415980	419740	Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap, we just won't use the word trap.
419740	423260	The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to trans women?
423260	424380	It is if you're a woman.
424380	425980	No, I mean for men.
425980	429100	Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?
429100	435260	Well, all the men I've dated only date women, but if they're attracted to me, I mean it's
435260	436860	not the straightest thing, is it?
436860	437500	Why not?
437500	441820	You look like a woman, and I know that you know that gay men are not attracted to these
441820	442300	tits.
442300	445980	Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.
445980	447740	Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria?
447740	452460	I mean, sure, she looks like a woman, but she does have XY chromosomes.
452460	455660	When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?
455660	457500	That's not how sexuality works.
457500	461420	We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular biology.
461420	467100	Okay, sure, but I mean a lot of trans women still have their penis, and you gotta admit,
467100	468700	that seems kinda gay.
468700	471260	Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?
471260	475260	We live in a world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women, but there's
475260	477660	an intense stigma on dating trans women.
477660	481820	And it's actually dangerous, because what happens is if a man's friends find out that
481820	486460	the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by
486460	489180	lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.
489180	490860	And this happens again and again.
490860	495180	And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma,
495180	498380	and you're making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women.
498380	502780	Alright, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a
502780	506540	person who's attracted to women could be attracted to a person with a penis.
506540	508620	Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.
508620	509740	I am a lesbian.
509740	512620	I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.
512620	515980	And when I'm attracted to a trans woman, I perceive her as a woman.
515980	521580	And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation, but as a part of her female body.
521580	525100	So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.
525100	526460	I'm sorry, what?
526460	527500	What is girl dick?
528060	529420	The feminine penis.
529420	530060	Oh no.
530060	531020	Oh come on!
531020	532460	This is nonsense!
532460	534940	How could a penis possibly be feminine?
534940	537100	Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,
537100	541980	but also because hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis.
542860	544860	Shut up, Adria, just shut up!
544860	545900	Wait, really?
545900	546780	How is it different?
546780	548140	Well, I'm glad you asked.
548140	550460	More needs to be said about the feminine penis.
550460	552700	Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?
553340	553980	Kill me now.
553980	555820	So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,
555820	558860	it doesn't really ejaculate, and it has a different mouthfeel.
559420	561260	Can we please talk about the mouthfeel?
561260	563180	Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel?
564220	565740	I don't think that's necessary.
565740	567820	I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.
567820	572220	You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.
572220	573260	That's correct.
573260	574620	I don't like man dick.
574620	579100	It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.
579100	580300	Not like girl dick.
580300	582700	Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.
582700	584380	What is that, Star Wars?
585100	587260	Do you also build computers for a living?
587260	588620	I mean, guilty.
588620	590300	I also enjoy wearing knee socks.
593100	596220	And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.
596220	597420	My sweet love.
597420	599740	Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?
599740	601500	Well, we're in the same polyhule.
601500	604460	I don't know what that means, and I'm not like prejudiced or anything,
604460	608220	but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.
608220	611660	Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,
611660	613820	how is it not just heterosexuality?
613820	619100	Well, my girlfriend is also trans, so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...
619660	623980	Okay, so you're a woman who was born a man,
624940	628300	and you like women, but you're dating a woman,
629180	633340	a woman who has a penis that's a female penis that used to be a male penis.
634060	637740	So you're a woman, but you were born a man,
638540	642300	and you're attracted to a penis that used to be a male penis,
642380	644460	but now it's a female penis.
644460	648700	So that means you are gay, but you're gay in the opposite way,
648700	649900	as the kind of gay that you were born as.
649900	652140	I can go over it with you again after the show,
652140	654300	if you need some extra time to figure it out.
654300	657340	Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?
657340	659260	Adria, just stop talking.
659260	662780	Look, I don't care what you do in private, but I'm sorry to break it to you,
662780	665740	the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.
665740	669260	What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,
669260	671740	and people like me to be our representatives.
671740	674940	Because I act like a normal woman, and I date normal men,
674940	677900	and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick, ugh.
678700	680780	Also, I look fucking gorgeous.
680780	682780	I'm sorry, but that matters.
682780	686060	Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.
686060	687500	You're not Blair White.
687500	689980	Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,
689980	691420	so that's not a fair comparison.
691420	692620	What work are you having done?
692620	695740	I'm gonna lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,
695740	698460	reshape my brow, get some lip injections,
698460	700380	maybe Botox my forehead.
700380	702700	Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.
702700	704300	What's wrong with your nose?
704300	706060	It's kind of big and mannish.
706060	707980	Well, my nose looks kind of like that.
707980	709660	Are you saying I look mannish?
709660	711260	Are you saying I look ugly?
711260	712780	What are you trying to say, Tiffany?
712780	713900	Why are you doing this to me?
713900	715260	Why are you doing this to women?
716060	717500	I'm not doing anything to women.
717500	718460	What, what?
718460	721020	Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.
721820	723820	That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.
723820	726860	She has to work really hard to be seen as female, and you just don't.
726860	728380	Shut the hell up, Adria.
728380	729900	Don't get offended for me.
729980	731500	Don't condescend to me.
731500	732460	I'm not a victim.
733340	735580	Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,
736140	739180	but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.
739180	740220	Oh my god.
740220	743340	I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.
747020	748620	All right, let's, let's forget about it.
748620	751420	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fine.
752060	753660	Tiffany, are you fine?
753660	754700	I'm fine.
754700	756940	To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.
756940	758860	Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?
758860	761260	Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.
762700	765660	Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,
765660	768620	but the important thing is that we talked about it.
768620	772380	I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.
772940	774780	Your mascara is running.
774780	776860	Get out of my studio, both, both of you.
778540	779040	Get out.
779900	780460	We're done.
788860	789740	Hi, Nick.
789740	790620	Yeah, I'm finished.
791660	792940	Well, it was a shitshow.
794380	796300	No, Adria was fine.
796300	797980	She was cringe as fuck the whole time.
797980	798860	Let's have her back.
799420	800620	Tiffany was the problem.
800620	804060	She kept veering off message and she got emotional.
806140	807340	Yeah, don't invite her back.
809260	810380	Get Blair next time.
812140	812940	And the week after.
813500	814620	Can we get Kanye West?
814620	815580	We can't get Kanye.
816700	817740	Get Candace Owens.
818380	820460	Oh, and what have you done to my studio?
822300	826940	Hey, Adria, look, I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?
826940	830780	It's just that I've been working so hard to win acceptance for trans people,
830780	833500	to show everyone that we're normal, we're just like them.
834060	838860	And when you show up looking like that and acting like that,
838860	842460	it's just hard for me to watch all my hard work be undone, you know?
842460	847340	Like, you can't be talking about the feminine penis in front of cis people.
847340	851500	Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.
851500	854460	Oh my god, you crazy freak!
877340	893740	I hate Adria.
894460	896300	She looks like a man beast.
896300	899500	Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.
900700	901820	Ah, this hun.
902540	905740	People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.
907820	909100	You should not be representing us.
909820	910700	They're nothing like me.
910700	911740	I'm nothing like them.
911740	913020	I'm not a transphobia.
913980	927740	I need you to relax.
933180	933820	Well, it's off.
934300	937660	You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.
937660	941260	I look good, but Adria is fucking everything up.
943100	944380	All right, what are they saying?
947740	960220	Fuck it.
963900	968780	Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know that.
968780	972220	I may have a mental illness, but I'm self-aware about it.
972220	973900	I'm not delusional.
973900	975020	I'm not like Adria.
975660	976780	I'm nothing like her.
979500	980780	You know, it's fine.
980780	982220	It's gonna be fine.
982220	983900	I'm gonna have the work done.
983900	984940	I can fix this.
985980	988220	It's my fault for not working harder.
988220	989980	You can't just expect society to...
991660	992540	I'm not a victim.
994540	998300	I am in control of my life.
1002860	1009420	I wish I were a woman or anything but this.
1013740	1016220	I'm destroying my body.
1020380	1022860	Who could ever love this?
1024140	1028700	I'm just mutilating myself.
1031180	1033340	It's so disgusting.
1035900	1038460	God, I'm so disgusting.
1041820	1043900	It's so disgusting.
1044780	1059980	I'm just sitting in front of the drink.
1059980	1061340	I am not a victim.
1062620	1065980	I am in complete control.
1074540	1077980	I am in control.
1077980	1079980	I am in control.
1079980	1081980	I am in control.
1081980	1083980	I am in control.
1164780	1166780	I am in control.
1172220	1175420	Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles.
1175420	1177980	Welcome to my world.
1193900	1207900	You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware
1207900	1213900	of how crude, heard before, bigoted and plain rude.
1213900	1217420	All the things that you say come up every day.
1217420	1224620	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.
1224620	1231420	It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.
1231420	1233420	It's so disgusting.
1233420	1235420	It's really disgusting.
1235420	1237420	It's so disgusting.
1237420	1239420	It's really disgusting.
1239420	1241420	It's so disgusting.
1241420	1243420	It's really disgusting.
1243420	1245420	It's really disgusting.
1245420	1253420	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.
1253420	1261420	It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.
1261420	1263420	Don't let them define us.
