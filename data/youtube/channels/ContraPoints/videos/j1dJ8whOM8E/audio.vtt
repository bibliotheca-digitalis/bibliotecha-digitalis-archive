00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.720
Welcome to my world.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.720
Every week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.720
Come get ready with me.

00:16.720 --> 00:23.240
So I'm going to go in with the color snowflake from my winter rose palette using a flaunt

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
325 brush.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.240
Smoke it out.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.240
You want to just kind of zhuzh it.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.680
That looks bomb.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.680
It's major.

00:30.680 --> 00:31.680
I'm vibing it.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.680
I'm obsessed.

00:32.680 --> 00:33.680
It's literally snatched.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.680
Love, love, love.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
Yes.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.680
Okay.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.680
I'm not living for it.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.680
Oh my god.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.680
I think I glued my eye shut.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.680
Fuck.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.680
But I'm not just a pretty face.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.680
I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim, because I prefer to take control of my own

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
life.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.680
I'm a woman.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
I'm a woman.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.680
I'm a woman.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.680
I'm a woman.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.680
I'm a woman.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.680
I'm a woman.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.680
I'm a woman.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
I'm a woman.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
I'm a woman.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
I'm a woman.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.680
I'm a woman.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
I'm a woman.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
I'm a woman.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.680
I'm a woman.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.680
I'm a woman.

00:59.680 --> 01:00.680
I'm a woman.

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
But I still prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our President

01:01.680 --> 01:03.600
Donald J. Trump.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.800
Make traps gay again.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.160
Bye.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.380
Hi.

01:09.380 --> 01:13.520
I'm Jacky Jackson.

01:13.520 --> 01:32.440
Host of the Freedom Report, where I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese drag

01:32.440 --> 01:35.720
queen redecorated in an Italian bordello?

01:35.720 --> 01:38.000
It's hard to move past it.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.880
Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political

01:42.880 --> 01:47.440
spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate

01:47.440 --> 01:54.880
about a timeless question.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.960
Are traps gay?

01:55.960 --> 02:01.360
My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.360
Clarence.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.640
Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria.

02:04.640 --> 02:09.440
Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?

02:09.440 --> 02:10.760
Okay.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.440
My other guest is returning to the show, it's Tiffany Tumbles.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.560
Now Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this

02:17.560 --> 02:19.120
program, isn't that right?

02:19.120 --> 02:20.120
That's right, Jacky.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.600
It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
You poor thing.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.080
Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?

02:28.080 --> 02:32.180
Well I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders, and how I was tired

02:32.180 --> 02:37.280
of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I

02:37.280 --> 02:41.200
know everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?

02:41.200 --> 02:42.200
I'm out.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.760
I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.240
I think that's just so brave of you.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.520
Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
Shut up, Adria.

02:52.520 --> 02:57.520
I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that,

02:57.520 --> 03:01.560
the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support, nothing.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.760
I was absolutely alone.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.260
Do you have any idea what that felt like?

03:05.260 --> 03:07.980
Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.020
One wrong move and you're dead to them.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.020
Those are not friends.

03:11.020 --> 03:13.180
Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.

03:13.180 --> 03:17.140
I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals who are

03:17.140 --> 03:21.460
finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against politically

03:21.460 --> 03:22.460
correct dogma.

03:22.460 --> 03:26.380
Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

03:26.380 --> 03:32.300
So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow, till I'm

03:32.300 --> 03:34.500
literally blinding.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.500
I am glowing.

03:35.500 --> 03:40.180
Mmm, she's doing alright, but I'm not living for it.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.780
You know what else I'm not living for?

03:43.780 --> 03:44.780
The Muslims.

03:44.780 --> 03:47.140
Tiffany, you are so funny.

03:47.140 --> 03:50.020
I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?

03:50.020 --> 03:51.580
How is that racist?

03:51.580 --> 03:53.060
Muslim's a religion, not a race.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.780
Yeah, Adria, Muslim's a religion, not a race.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.180
Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.

03:59.180 --> 04:00.180
You can't just...

04:00.180 --> 04:02.780
Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.420
Let's try to get back on track here.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.820
So, Adria, traps.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.820
Are they gay?

04:08.820 --> 04:12.060
Look, there's so many things wrong with the question that the only way to answer it is

04:12.060 --> 04:13.620
to deconstruct it.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.260
First of all, what are traps?

04:15.260 --> 04:16.260
Are they trans women?

04:16.260 --> 04:19.540
Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing into the lie

04:19.540 --> 04:24.220
that trans women are tricking or trapping men, a lie that reinforces the mentality that

04:24.220 --> 04:25.700
causes men to murder us.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.580
Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.580
What about anime?

04:29.580 --> 04:33.220
Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.

04:33.220 --> 04:37.660
The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser, there's no implication

04:37.660 --> 04:38.660
of tricking men.

04:38.660 --> 04:43.180
But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women, so when you

04:43.180 --> 04:46.980
tell us that's not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us, because we've all heard

04:46.980 --> 04:47.980
it used as a slur.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.300
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.140
We're not all offended all the time.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.500
I actually happen to identify as a trap.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.860
Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.900
Well, she's in the sunken place.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.700
And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.980
Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you, his defense is gonna be,

05:03.980 --> 05:07.860
well, she was a trap, I was tricked, and you'll have contributed to that way of thinking?

05:07.860 --> 05:08.860
Well, what do you care, Adria?

05:08.860 --> 05:11.340
No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.340
Ooh, spicy.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.940
The fuck did you just say?

05:13.940 --> 05:17.140
I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.

05:17.140 --> 05:20.020
Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.900
Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.860
Look, dragging bitches is what I do.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.180
Facts over feels, hunty.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.660
Wow, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?

05:29.740 --> 05:33.260
Like, if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in.

05:33.260 --> 05:35.420
I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?

05:35.420 --> 05:37.500
How are you gonna attract men with that?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
I'm not trying to attract men.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.460
I'm a lesbian.

05:40.460 --> 05:46.780
I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.740
Well, I'm a woman, and I like women.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.100
I don't know about that.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.140
Sounds debatable.

05:52.140 --> 05:55.420
I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the

05:55.420 --> 05:56.780
transphobia special.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.380
Transphobia?

05:58.460 --> 06:00.780
Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.

06:00.780 --> 06:05.500
I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program, and I'll have you know that

06:05.500 --> 06:08.540
one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.100
And what could be transphobic about that?

06:11.100 --> 06:14.220
See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans people.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.580
You're obnoxious and offended by everything, and everyone feels like they have to trot

06:17.580 --> 06:18.780
on eggshells around you.

06:18.780 --> 06:19.740
Thank you, Tiffany.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.340
See, you're one of the good ones.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.300
You're a good tran.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.540
Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany?

06:24.540 --> 06:26.620
Be the lapdog of people like this?

06:26.620 --> 06:27.180
No.

06:27.180 --> 06:31.820
I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient, and agreeable,

06:31.820 --> 06:35.660
and by looking the part, and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet

06:35.660 --> 06:37.340
your impossible standard of wokeness.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.140
And you're going to do that by identifying as a trap, huh?

06:40.140 --> 06:43.740
Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away.

06:43.740 --> 06:47.020
Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany, that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone

06:47.020 --> 06:50.220
but yourself, and the only reason you're accepted is that you don't challenge the

06:50.220 --> 06:50.940
status quo?

06:50.940 --> 06:54.140
I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because I feel like we're just

06:54.140 --> 06:55.980
getting hung up on terminology.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.740
Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap, we just won't use the word trap.

06:59.740 --> 07:03.260
The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to trans women?

07:03.260 --> 07:04.380
It is if you're a woman.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.980
No, I mean for men.

07:05.980 --> 07:09.100
Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?

07:09.100 --> 07:15.260
Well, all the men I've dated only date women, but if they're attracted to me, I mean it's

07:15.260 --> 07:16.860
not the straightest thing, is it?

07:16.860 --> 07:17.500
Why not?

07:17.500 --> 07:21.820
You look like a woman, and I know that you know that gay men are not attracted to these

07:21.820 --> 07:22.300
tits.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.980
Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.740
Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria?

07:27.740 --> 07:32.460
I mean, sure, she looks like a woman, but she does have XY chromosomes.

07:32.460 --> 07:35.660
When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?

07:35.660 --> 07:37.500
That's not how sexuality works.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.420
We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular biology.

07:41.420 --> 07:47.100
Okay, sure, but I mean a lot of trans women still have their penis, and you gotta admit,

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
that seems kinda gay.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.260
Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?

07:51.260 --> 07:55.260
We live in a world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women, but there's

07:55.260 --> 07:57.660
an intense stigma on dating trans women.

07:57.660 --> 08:01.820
And it's actually dangerous, because what happens is if a man's friends find out that

08:01.820 --> 08:06.460
the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by

08:06.460 --> 08:09.180
lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.860
And this happens again and again.

08:10.860 --> 08:15.180
And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma,

08:15.180 --> 08:18.380
and you're making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women.

08:18.380 --> 08:22.780
Alright, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a

08:22.780 --> 08:26.540
person who's attracted to women could be attracted to a person with a penis.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.620
Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.

08:28.620 --> 08:29.740
I am a lesbian.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.620
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.980
And when I'm attracted to a trans woman, I perceive her as a woman.

08:35.980 --> 08:41.580
And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation, but as a part of her female body.

08:41.580 --> 08:45.100
So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.460
I'm sorry, what?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.500
What is girl dick?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.420
The feminine penis.

08:49.420 --> 08:50.060
Oh no.

08:50.060 --> 08:51.020
Oh come on!

08:51.020 --> 08:52.460
This is nonsense!

08:52.460 --> 08:54.940
How could a penis possibly be feminine?

08:54.940 --> 08:57.100
Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,

08:57.100 --> 09:01.980
but also because hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.860
Shut up, Adria, just shut up!

09:04.860 --> 09:05.900
Wait, really?

09:05.900 --> 09:06.780
How is it different?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.140
Well, I'm glad you asked.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.460
More needs to be said about the feminine penis.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.700
Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?

09:13.340 --> 09:13.980
Kill me now.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.820
So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,

09:15.820 --> 09:18.860
it doesn't really ejaculate, and it has a different mouthfeel.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.260
Can we please talk about the mouthfeel?

09:21.260 --> 09:23.180
Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel?

09:24.220 --> 09:25.740
I don't think that's necessary.

09:25.740 --> 09:27.820
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.

09:27.820 --> 09:32.220
You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.260
That's correct.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.620
I don't like man dick.

09:34.620 --> 09:39.100
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.300
Not like girl dick.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.700
Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.380
What is that, Star Wars?

09:45.100 --> 09:47.260
Do you also build computers for a living?

09:47.260 --> 09:48.620
I mean, guilty.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.300
I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.220
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.420
My sweet love.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.740
Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?

09:59.740 --> 10:01.500
Well, we're in the same polyhule.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.460
I don't know what that means, and I'm not like prejudiced or anything,

10:04.460 --> 10:08.220
but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

10:08.220 --> 10:11.660
Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,

10:11.660 --> 10:13.820
how is it not just heterosexuality?

10:13.820 --> 10:19.100
Well, my girlfriend is also trans, so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...

10:19.660 --> 10:23.980
Okay, so you're a woman who was born a man,

10:24.940 --> 10:28.300
and you like women, but you're dating a woman,

10:29.180 --> 10:33.340
a woman who has a penis that's a female penis that used to be a male penis.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.740
So you're a woman, but you were born a man,

10:38.540 --> 10:42.300
and you're attracted to a penis that used to be a male penis,

10:42.380 --> 10:44.460
but now it's a female penis.

10:44.460 --> 10:48.700
So that means you are gay, but you're gay in the opposite way,

10:48.700 --> 10:49.900
as the kind of gay that you were born as.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.140
I can go over it with you again after the show,

10:52.140 --> 10:54.300
if you need some extra time to figure it out.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.340
Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?

10:57.340 --> 10:59.260
Adria, just stop talking.

10:59.260 --> 11:02.780
Look, I don't care what you do in private, but I'm sorry to break it to you,

11:02.780 --> 11:05.740
the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

11:05.740 --> 11:09.260
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,

11:09.260 --> 11:11.740
and people like me to be our representatives.

11:11.740 --> 11:14.940
Because I act like a normal woman, and I date normal men,

11:14.940 --> 11:17.900
and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick, ugh.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.780
Also, I look fucking gorgeous.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.780
I'm sorry, but that matters.

11:22.780 --> 11:26.060
Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.500
You're not Blair White.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.980
Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,

11:29.980 --> 11:31.420
so that's not a fair comparison.

11:31.420 --> 11:32.620
What work are you having done?

11:32.620 --> 11:35.740
I'm gonna lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,

11:35.740 --> 11:38.460
reshape my brow, get some lip injections,

11:38.460 --> 11:40.380
maybe Botox my forehead.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.700
Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.300
What's wrong with your nose?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.060
It's kind of big and mannish.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.980
Well, my nose looks kind of like that.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.660
Are you saying I look mannish?

11:49.660 --> 11:51.260
Are you saying I look ugly?

11:51.260 --> 11:52.780
What are you trying to say, Tiffany?

11:52.780 --> 11:53.900
Why are you doing this to me?

11:53.900 --> 11:55.260
Why are you doing this to women?

11:56.060 --> 11:57.500
I'm not doing anything to women.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.460
What, what?

11:58.460 --> 12:01.020
Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.820
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.860
She has to work really hard to be seen as female, and you just don't.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.380
Shut the hell up, Adria.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.900
Don't get offended for me.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.500
Don't condescend to me.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.460
I'm not a victim.

12:13.340 --> 12:15.580
Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,

12:16.140 --> 12:19.180
but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.

12:19.180 --> 12:20.220
Oh my god.

12:20.220 --> 12:23.340
I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.620
All right, let's, let's forget about it.

12:28.620 --> 12:31.420
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fine.

12:32.060 --> 12:33.660
Tiffany, are you fine?

12:33.660 --> 12:34.700
I'm fine.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.940
To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.

12:36.940 --> 12:38.860
Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?

12:38.860 --> 12:41.260
Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.660
Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,

12:45.660 --> 12:48.620
but the important thing is that we talked about it.

12:48.620 --> 12:52.380
I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.780
Your mascara is running.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.860
Get out of my studio, both, both of you.

12:58.540 --> 12:59.040
Get out.

12:59.900 --> 13:00.460
We're done.

13:08.860 --> 13:09.740
Hi, Nick.

13:09.740 --> 13:10.620
Yeah, I'm finished.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.940
Well, it was a shitshow.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.300
No, Adria was fine.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.980
She was cringe as fuck the whole time.

13:17.980 --> 13:18.860
Let's have her back.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.620
Tiffany was the problem.

13:20.620 --> 13:24.060
She kept veering off message and she got emotional.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.340
Yeah, don't invite her back.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.380
Get Blair next time.

13:32.140 --> 13:32.940
And the week after.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.620
Can we get Kanye West?

13:34.620 --> 13:35.580
We can't get Kanye.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.740
Get Candace Owens.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.460
Oh, and what have you done to my studio?

13:42.300 --> 13:46.940
Hey, Adria, look, I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?

13:46.940 --> 13:50.780
It's just that I've been working so hard to win acceptance for trans people,

13:50.780 --> 13:53.500
to show everyone that we're normal, we're just like them.

13:54.060 --> 13:58.860
And when you show up looking like that and acting like that,

13:58.860 --> 14:02.460
it's just hard for me to watch all my hard work be undone, you know?

14:02.460 --> 14:07.340
Like, you can't be talking about the feminine penis in front of cis people.

14:07.340 --> 14:11.500
Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.460
Oh my god, you crazy freak!

14:37.340 --> 14:53.740
I hate Adria.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.300
She looks like a man beast.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.500
Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.820
Ah, this hun.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.740
People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.100
You should not be representing us.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.700
They're nothing like me.

15:10.700 --> 15:11.740
I'm nothing like them.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.020
I'm not a transphobia.

15:13.980 --> 15:27.740
I need you to relax.

15:33.180 --> 15:33.820
Well, it's off.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.660
You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.

15:37.660 --> 15:41.260
I look good, but Adria is fucking everything up.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.380
All right, what are they saying?

15:47.740 --> 16:00.220
Fuck it.

16:03.900 --> 16:08.780
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know that.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.220
I may have a mental illness, but I'm self-aware about it.

16:12.220 --> 16:13.900
I'm not delusional.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.020
I'm not like Adria.

16:15.660 --> 16:16.780
I'm nothing like her.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.780
You know, it's fine.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.220
It's gonna be fine.

16:22.220 --> 16:23.900
I'm gonna have the work done.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.940
I can fix this.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.220
It's my fault for not working harder.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.980
You can't just expect society to...

16:31.660 --> 16:32.540
I'm not a victim.

16:34.540 --> 16:38.300
I am in control of my life.

16:42.860 --> 16:49.420
I wish I were a woman or anything but this.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.220
I'm destroying my body.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.860
Who could ever love this?

17:04.140 --> 17:08.700
I'm just mutilating myself.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.340
It's so disgusting.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.460
God, I'm so disgusting.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.900
It's so disgusting.

17:24.780 --> 17:39.980
I'm just sitting in front of the drink.

17:39.980 --> 17:41.340
I am not a victim.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.980
I am in complete control.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.980
I am in control.

17:57.980 --> 17:59.980
I am in control.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.980
I am in control.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.980
I am in control.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.780
I am in control.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.420
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.980
Welcome to my world.

19:53.900 --> 20:07.900
You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware

20:07.900 --> 20:13.900
of how crude, heard before, bigoted and plain rude.

20:13.900 --> 20:17.420
All the things that you say come up every day.

20:17.420 --> 20:24.620
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

20:24.620 --> 20:31.420
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.

20:31.420 --> 20:33.420
It's so disgusting.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.420
It's really disgusting.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.420
It's so disgusting.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.420
It's really disgusting.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.420
It's so disgusting.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.420
It's really disgusting.

20:43.420 --> 20:45.420
It's really disgusting.

20:45.420 --> 20:53.420
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

20:53.420 --> 21:01.420
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.420
Don't let them define us.
