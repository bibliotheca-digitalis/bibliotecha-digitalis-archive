00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
Welcome to my world.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Every week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Come get ready with me.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,240
So I'm going to go in with the color snowflake from my winter rose palette using a flaunt

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
325 brush.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Smoke it out.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,240
You want to just kind of zhuzh it.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
That looks bomb.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,680
It's major.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm vibing it.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
I'm obsessed.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
It's literally snatched.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
Love, love, love.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Yes.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Okay.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm not living for it.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Oh my god.

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
I think I glued my eye shut.

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
Fuck.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
But I'm not just a pretty face.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
I also share plenty of opinions about controversial social and political issues.

23
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Even though I'm trans, I refuse to be a victim, because I prefer to take control of my own

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
life.

25
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
I'm a woman.

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm a woman.

27
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
I'm a woman.

28
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm a woman.

29
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm a woman.

30
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm a woman.

31
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm a woman.

32
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm a woman.

33
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm a woman.

34
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm a woman.

35
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm a woman.

36
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
I'm a woman.

37
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm a woman.

38
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm a woman.

39
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm a woman.

40
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm a woman.

41
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
But I still prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our President

42
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
Donald J. Trump.

43
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
Make traps gay again.

44
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,160
Bye.

45
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,380
Hi.

46
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm Jacky Jackson.

47
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:32,440
Host of the Freedom Report, where I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese drag

48
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,720
queen redecorated in an Italian bordello?

49
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,000
It's hard to move past it.

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,880
Anyway, tonight my guests are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,440
spectrum, but I've brought them here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate

52
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,880
about a timeless question.

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,960
Are traps gay?

54
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,360
My first guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Clarence.

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria.

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,440
Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,760
Okay.

59
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,440
My other guest is returning to the show, it's Tiffany Tumbles.

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,560
Now Tiffany, you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this

61
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,120
program, isn't that right?

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
That's right, Jacky.

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,600
It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

64
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
You poor thing.

65
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,080
Could you say a little bit about how you came to take the red pill?

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,180
Well I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders, and how I was tired

67
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,280
of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans, and next thing I

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
know everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm out.

70
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.

71
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,240
I think that's just so brave of you.

72
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.

73
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Shut up, Adria.

74
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,520
I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online, and then like that,

75
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,560
the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support, nothing.

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,760
I was absolutely alone.

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,260
Do you have any idea what that felt like?

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,980
Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria.

79
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,020
One wrong move and you're dead to them.

80
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Those are not friends.

81
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,180
Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.

82
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,140
I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals who are

83
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,460
finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left and speaking out against politically

84
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
correct dogma.

85
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,380
Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

86
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,300
So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks, pop it on my brow, till I'm

87
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,500
literally blinding.

88
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I am glowing.

89
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,180
Mmm, she's doing alright, but I'm not living for it.

90
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,780
You know what else I'm not living for?

91
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
The Muslims.

92
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,140
Tiffany, you are so funny.

93
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?

94
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,580
How is that racist?

95
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,060
Muslim's a religion, not a race.

96
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,780
Yeah, Adria, Muslim's a religion, not a race.

97
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,180
Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.

98
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
You can't just...

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,780
Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.

100
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,420
Let's try to get back on track here.

101
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,820
So, Adria, traps.

102
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Are they gay?

103
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,060
Look, there's so many things wrong with the question that the only way to answer it is

104
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,620
to deconstruct it.

105
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,260
First of all, what are traps?

106
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
Are they trans women?

107
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,540
Because if you're calling trans women traps, then you're directly playing into the lie

108
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,220
that trans women are tricking or trapping men, a lie that reinforces the mentality that

109
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,700
causes men to murder us.

110
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,580
Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.

111
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,580
What about anime?

112
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,220
Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.

113
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,660
The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser, there's no implication

114
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
of tricking men.

115
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,180
But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women, so when you

116
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,980
tell us that's not what it means, you're gaslighting the shit out of us, because we've all heard

117
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
it used as a slur.

118
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,300
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.

119
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,140
We're not all offended all the time.

120
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,500
I actually happen to identify as a trap.

121
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,860
Yeah, Adria, she identifies as a trap.

122
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,900
Well, she's in the sunken place.

123
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,700
And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.

124
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,980
Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you, his defense is gonna be,

125
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,860
well, she was a trap, I was tricked, and you'll have contributed to that way of thinking?

126
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
Well, what do you care, Adria?

127
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,340
No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.

128
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
Ooh, spicy.

129
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,940
The fuck did you just say?

130
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,140
I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.

131
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,020
Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?

132
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,900
Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.

133
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,860
Look, dragging bitches is what I do.

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,180
Facts over feels, hunty.

135
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,660
Wow, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?

136
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,260
Like, if you want to be taken seriously, you could put a little more effort in.

137
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,420
I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?

138
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,500
How are you gonna attract men with that?

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm not trying to attract men.

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,460
I'm a lesbian.

141
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question, but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?

142
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,740
Well, I'm a woman, and I like women.

143
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,100
I don't know about that.

144
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,140
Sounds debatable.

145
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,420
I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show that I was signing up for the

146
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,780
transphobia special.

147
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,380
Transphobia?

148
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,780
Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.

149
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,500
I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program, and I'll have you know that

150
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,540
one of my best friends happens to be a gay man.

151
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,100
And what could be transphobic about that?

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,220
See, Adria, you're the reason why everyone hates trans people.

153
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,580
You're obnoxious and offended by everything, and everyone feels like they have to trot

154
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,780
on eggshells around you.

155
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,740
Thank you, Tiffany.

156
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,340
See, you're one of the good ones.

157
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,300
You're a good tran.

158
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,540
Is this what you want to do with your life, Tiffany?

159
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,620
Be the lapdog of people like this?

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,180
No.

161
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,820
I want to actually work toward the acceptance of trans people by being patient, and agreeable,

162
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,660
and by looking the part, and not by screeching transphobia at everyone who doesn't meet

163
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,340
your impossible standard of wokeness.

164
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,140
And you're going to do that by identifying as a trap, huh?

165
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,740
Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry until it magically goes away.

166
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,020
Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany, that you're not gaining acceptance for anyone

167
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,220
but yourself, and the only reason you're accepted is that you don't challenge the

168
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,940
status quo?

169
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,140
I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas because I feel like we're just

170
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,980
getting hung up on terminology.

171
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,740
Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap, we just won't use the word trap.

172
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,260
The real question is, is it gay to be attracted to trans women?

173
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,380
It is if you're a woman.

174
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,980
No, I mean for men.

175
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,100
Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?

176
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,260
Well, all the men I've dated only date women, but if they're attracted to me, I mean it's

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,860
not the straightest thing, is it?

178
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,500
Why not?

179
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,820
You look like a woman, and I know that you know that gay men are not attracted to these

180
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,300
tits.

181
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,980
Well, I am serving up fishy realness, so granted.

182
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,740
Well, doesn't she have a point though, Adria?

183
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,460
I mean, sure, she looks like a woman, but she does have XY chromosomes.

184
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,660
When was the last time you were attracted to a person's chromosomes?

185
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,500
That's not how sexuality works.

186
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,420
We're attracted to a person's perceptible features, not molecular biology.

187
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,100
Okay, sure, but I mean a lot of trans women still have their penis, and you gotta admit,

188
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
that seems kinda gay.

189
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,260
Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?

190
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,260
We live in a world where there's no shortage of men who want to date trans women, but there's

191
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,660
an intense stigma on dating trans women.

192
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,820
And it's actually dangerous, because what happens is if a man's friends find out that

193
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,460
the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by

194
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,180
lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.

195
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
And this happens again and again.

196
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,180
And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay, you're adding to that stigma,

197
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,380
and you're making the world a more dangerous and violent place for trans women.

198
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,780
Alright, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever, I just don't understand how a

199
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,540
person who's attracted to women could be attracted to a person with a penis.

200
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,620
Well, if you want to know, I'll tell you.

201
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,740
I am a lesbian.

202
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,620
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.

203
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,980
And when I'm attracted to a trans woman, I perceive her as a woman.

204
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,580
And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation, but as a part of her female body.

205
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,100
So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.

206
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,460
I'm sorry, what?

207
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,500
What is girl dick?

208
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,420
The feminine penis.

209
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,060
Oh no.

210
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,020
Oh come on!

211
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,460
This is nonsense!

212
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,940
How could a penis possibly be feminine?

213
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,100
Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,

214
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,980
but also because hormones actually change the anatomy and functionality of the penis.

215
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Shut up, Adria, just shut up!

216
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,900
Wait, really?

217
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,780
How is it different?

218
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,140
Well, I'm glad you asked.

219
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,460
More needs to be said about the feminine penis.

220
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,700
Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?

221
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,980
Kill me now.

222
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,820
So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,

223
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,860
it doesn't really ejaculate, and it has a different mouthfeel.

224
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,260
Can we please talk about the mouthfeel?

225
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,180
Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel?

226
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,740
I don't think that's necessary.

227
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,820
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.

228
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,220
You are attracted to women with dicks, but not to men.

229
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,260
That's correct.

230
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,620
I don't like man dick.

231
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,100
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it comes everywhere.

232
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,300
Not like girl dick.

233
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,700
Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.

234
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,380
What is that, Star Wars?

235
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,260
Do you also build computers for a living?

236
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,620
I mean, guilty.

237
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

238
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,220
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.

239
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,420
My sweet love.

240
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,740
Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?

241
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,500
Well, we're in the same polyhule.

242
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,460
I don't know what that means, and I'm not like prejudiced or anything,

243
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,220
but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

244
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,660
Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,

245
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,820
how is it not just heterosexuality?

246
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,100
Well, my girlfriend is also trans, so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...

247
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,980
Okay, so you're a woman who was born a man,

248
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,300
and you like women, but you're dating a woman,

249
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,340
a woman who has a penis that's a female penis that used to be a male penis.

250
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,740
So you're a woman, but you were born a man,

251
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,300
and you're attracted to a penis that used to be a male penis,

252
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,460
but now it's a female penis.

253
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,700
So that means you are gay, but you're gay in the opposite way,

254
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,900
as the kind of gay that you were born as.

255
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,140
I can go over it with you again after the show,

256
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,300
if you need some extra time to figure it out.

257
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,340
Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?

258
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,260
Adria, just stop talking.

259
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,780
Look, I don't care what you do in private, but I'm sorry to break it to you,

260
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,740
the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

261
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,260
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,

262
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,740
and people like me to be our representatives.

263
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,940
Because I act like a normal woman, and I date normal men,

264
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,900
and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick, ugh.

265
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,780
Also, I look fucking gorgeous.

266
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
I'm sorry, but that matters.

267
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,060
Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.

268
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,500
You're not Blair White.

269
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,980
Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,

270
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,420
so that's not a fair comparison.

271
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,620
What work are you having done?

272
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,740
I'm gonna lower my hairline, shave some bone off my jaw,

273
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,460
reshape my brow, get some lip injections,

274
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,380
maybe Botox my forehead.

275
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,700
Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.

276
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
What's wrong with your nose?

277
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,060
It's kind of big and mannish.

278
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,980
Well, my nose looks kind of like that.

279
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,660
Are you saying I look mannish?

280
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,260
Are you saying I look ugly?

281
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,780
What are you trying to say, Tiffany?

282
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,900
Why are you doing this to me?

283
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,260
Why are you doing this to women?

284
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm not doing anything to women.

285
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,460
What, what?

286
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,020
Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

287
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.

288
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,860
She has to work really hard to be seen as female, and you just don't.

289
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,380
Shut the hell up, Adria.

290
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,900
Don't get offended for me.

291
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,500
Don't condescend to me.

292
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,460
I'm not a victim.

293
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,580
Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,

294
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,180
but my fiance still thinks I'm beautiful.

295
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,220
Oh my god.

296
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,340
I need to not be around straight people for a long time after this.

297
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,620
All right, let's, let's forget about it.

298
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fine.

299
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,660
Tiffany, are you fine?

300
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm fine.

301
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,940
To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.

302
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,860
Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?

303
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,260
Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.

304
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,660
Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,

305
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,620
but the important thing is that we talked about it.

306
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,380
I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report, where the debate never stops.

307
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,780
Your mascara is running.

308
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,860
Get out of my studio, both, both of you.

309
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,040
Get out.

310
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,460
We're done.

311
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,740
Hi, Nick.

312
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,620
Yeah, I'm finished.

313
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,940
Well, it was a shitshow.

314
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,300
No, Adria was fine.

315
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,980
She was cringe as fuck the whole time.

316
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,860
Let's have her back.

317
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,620
Tiffany was the problem.

318
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,060
She kept veering off message and she got emotional.

319
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,340
Yeah, don't invite her back.

320
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
Get Blair next time.

321
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,940
And the week after.

322
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,620
Can we get Kanye West?

323
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,580
We can't get Kanye.

324
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,740
Get Candace Owens.

325
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,460
Oh, and what have you done to my studio?

326
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,940
Hey, Adria, look, I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?

327
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,780
It's just that I've been working so hard to win acceptance for trans people,

328
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,500
to show everyone that we're normal, we're just like them.

329
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,860
And when you show up looking like that and acting like that,

330
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,460
it's just hard for me to watch all my hard work be undone, you know?

331
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,340
Like, you can't be talking about the feminine penis in front of cis people.

332
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,500
Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now for your own physical safety.

333
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,460
Oh my god, you crazy freak!

334
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:53,740
I hate Adria.

335
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,300
She looks like a man beast.

336
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,500
Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

337
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,820
Ah, this hun.

338
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,740
People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what trans people are.

339
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,100
You should not be representing us.

340
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
They're nothing like me.

341
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm nothing like them.

342
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,020
I'm not a transphobia.

343
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:27,740
I need you to relax.

344
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,820
Well, it's off.

345
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,660
You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.

346
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,260
I look good, but Adria is fucking everything up.

347
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,380
All right, what are they saying?

348
00:15:47,740 --> 00:16:00,220
Fuck it.

349
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,780
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly, but at least I know that.

350
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,220
I may have a mental illness, but I'm self-aware about it.

351
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,900
I'm not delusional.

352
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm not like Adria.

353
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,780
I'm nothing like her.

354
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,780
You know, it's fine.

355
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,220
It's gonna be fine.

356
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm gonna have the work done.

357
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,940
I can fix this.

358
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,220
It's my fault for not working harder.

359
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,980
You can't just expect society to...

360
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,540
I'm not a victim.

361
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,300
I am in control of my life.

362
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:49,420
I wish I were a woman or anything but this.

363
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,220
I'm destroying my body.

364
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,860
Who could ever love this?

365
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm just mutilating myself.

366
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,340
It's so disgusting.

367
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,460
God, I'm so disgusting.

368
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,900
It's so disgusting.

369
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:39,980
I'm just sitting in front of the drink.

370
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,340
I am not a victim.

371
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,980
I am in complete control.

372
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,980
I am in control.

373
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I am in control.

374
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
I am in control.

375
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,980
I am in control.

376
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
I am in control.

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,420
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tumbles.

378
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,980
Welcome to my world.

379
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:07,900
You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware

380
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,900
of how crude, heard before, bigoted and plain rude.

381
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,420
All the things that you say come up every day.

382
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:24,620
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

383
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,420
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.

384
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
It's so disgusting.

385
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
It's really disgusting.

386
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
It's so disgusting.

387
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
It's really disgusting.

388
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
It's so disgusting.

389
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
It's really disgusting.

390
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
It's really disgusting.

391
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:53,420
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

392
00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:01,420
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who bite us.

393
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Don't let them define us.
