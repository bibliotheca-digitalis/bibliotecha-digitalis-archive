WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.680
Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help!

00:19.680 --> 00:22.560
All right, I'm gonna get pliers. The lesbian solution.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.520
Okay. Let's get started.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.600
I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my

00:43.600 --> 00:51.280
2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands. All right, no one thinks I'm cute.

00:51.280 --> 00:57.120
Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about canceling, also known as cancel culture,

00:57.120 --> 01:01.120
formerly known as called out culture. And I know you kids know all about this,

01:01.120 --> 01:06.080
but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.680
So listen up oldies, in the lingo of these young avocado guzzling smartphone addicts

01:11.680 --> 01:18.320
who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent

01:18.320 --> 01:23.120
members of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang,

01:23.120 --> 01:29.520
this use of the word canceling started out on Black Twitter, where a few years ago people,

01:29.520 --> 01:33.840
well mostly women, would tweet cancel R. Kelly and things like that. You know,

01:33.840 --> 01:38.000
it started out as this vigilante strategy for bringing justice and accountability

01:38.000 --> 01:43.040
to powerful people who previously had been immune to any consequences for their actions.

01:43.040 --> 01:48.160
For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually

01:48.160 --> 01:52.720
abusive men in power who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of

01:52.720 --> 01:57.600
canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none, and bring justice

01:57.600 --> 02:02.240
to prominent abusers. It's in a way the 21st century version of the guillotine,

02:02.240 --> 02:07.520
the bringer of justice, the people's avenger. But also like the guillotine, it can become

02:07.520 --> 02:12.160
a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have,

02:13.040 --> 02:17.120
well, a teensy bit of a reign of terror situation on our hands, Gorge.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.520
Now there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.

02:21.520 --> 02:26.080
On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture

02:26.080 --> 02:29.920
is out of control, you can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial

02:29.920 --> 02:34.080
jackals trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive think piece

02:34.080 --> 02:38.880
authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture, it's just that powerful people

02:38.880 --> 02:42.560
are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it so

02:42.560 --> 02:47.120
they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints

02:47.120 --> 02:52.960
is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.560
He didn't know I was transgender. Storytime, emotional, not clickbait.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.800
Let's start with an example. The most high profile YouTube canceling of 2019

03:00.800 --> 03:04.240
was the canceling of James Charles. And again, I know you kids remember this, but

03:05.200 --> 03:10.000
I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders. Put the kettle on, Karen.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.760
So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.

03:15.760 --> 03:21.920
Look, there's these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.680
It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.

03:25.680 --> 03:31.520
I certainly can't. It's pretty bomb, it's lit, it's, uh, it's groovy, it's fab, it's far out,

03:31.520 --> 03:36.560
man, it's a gas, I fully dig it. Free love, give peace a chance, Nixon's a fascist.

03:36.560 --> 03:43.680
So back in May of this year, James' colleague and mother figure, fellow YouTube beauty guru

03:43.680 --> 03:50.560
Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40-minute video accusing James of endorsing a different brand

03:50.560 --> 03:58.160
of hair vitamins than the brand that she, wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.

03:58.160 --> 04:03.600
An enthralling plotline, I know. And this was huge, this was covered in the New York Times.

04:03.600 --> 04:09.520
And while Tati was at it, almost as an afterthought to the, uh, hair vitamin dispute,

04:09.520 --> 04:14.560
she also accused James of being a sexual predator.

04:14.560 --> 04:19.040
Now I actually went back and checked Tati's original deleted video,

04:19.040 --> 04:22.800
and she actually never uses the phrase sexual predator.

04:22.800 --> 04:27.360
It's funny, I remember her calling him that, because that became the story on Twitter.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.760
But what she actually said was,

04:29.760 --> 04:34.320
James had tried to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.

04:34.320 --> 04:39.200
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay, yet again.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.000
Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.160
But see, this is what cancel culture does.

04:46.160 --> 04:51.280
It takes one story and transforms it into a significantly different story.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.440
You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read,

04:55.440 --> 05:02.400
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.920
But cancel culture transforms that story into the headline,

05:05.920 --> 05:10.160
James Charles is a sexual predator.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.200
Interesting.

05:11.200 --> 05:16.000
Now I want to make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James Charles.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.760
I'm not a James Charles stan.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.400
I'm a biological female in my 30s.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.680
Close to death I know.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.440
Please leave a comment before I die.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.800
That said, I do think the statement,

05:26.800 --> 05:29.200
James Charles is a sexual predator,

05:29.200 --> 05:31.040
is a stretch to say the least.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.400
At least based on the information I have in December 2019.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.520
So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.960
Cancel culture trope one.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.480
And you should be writing this down class, because this will be on the test.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.920
Cancel culture trope one.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.520
Presumption of guilt.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.240
There's a traditional understanding of justice,

05:48.240 --> 05:51.760
according to which, before you condemn or punish a person,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.000
you hear the accuser's side of the story,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.320
and the accused's side of the story.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.480
You allow both sides to present evidence,

05:58.480 --> 06:02.400
and only after everyone involved has had a chance to make their case,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.280
do you pass sentence and punish the convict.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.960
Aw, punish me king.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.720
Drinking this is punishment enough.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.080
Am I uncanceled yet?

06:10.080 --> 06:10.960
Please?

06:10.960 --> 06:12.080
Now in the United States of...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.600
We legally have the presumption of innocence,

06:15.600 --> 06:18.720
but canceling does not abide by the law.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.600
Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice,

06:21.600 --> 06:24.880
and a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.400
Now that's basically the point of the progressive slogan,

06:28.400 --> 06:30.160
believe victims.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.280
It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces,

06:33.280 --> 06:35.200
because out in the world at large,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.760
people generally don't believe victims.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.560
But I think it's pretty obvious how believe victims

06:40.640 --> 06:42.880
is a norm that's easy to abuse.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.600
Was Tati really James' victim?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.320
No, she's not some powerless woman

06:48.320 --> 06:51.040
abused by a prominent man in her industry.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.800
She's on top of the industry,

06:52.800 --> 06:55.600
and she wasn't victimized by James at all.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.960
I see this case more as she weaponized cancel culture

06:58.960 --> 07:00.480
against a business rival.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.480
Anyway, before James had even had a chance

07:02.480 --> 07:04.400
to respond to Tati's accusation,

07:04.400 --> 07:07.360
the story had already gone from Tati Westbrook

07:07.360 --> 07:10.800
accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men

07:10.800 --> 07:13.920
to James Charles tried to trick straight men.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.480
And from there, it was generalized into

07:16.480 --> 07:19.200
James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

07:19.200 --> 07:23.200
which brings us to cancel culture trope two, abstraction.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.240
Abstraction replaces the specific,

07:26.240 --> 07:30.000
concrete details of a claim with a more generic statement.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.080
In the transition from Tati Westbrook

07:32.080 --> 07:35.200
accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men

07:35.200 --> 07:38.160
to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

07:38.160 --> 07:40.080
we've lost not only the sense of this

07:40.080 --> 07:42.160
being an unverified accusation,

07:42.160 --> 07:45.680
but we've also lost all the specific details.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.840
James Charles is toxic and manipulative

07:47.840 --> 07:50.000
is an incredibly vague statement.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.480
It may as well be James Charles is bad.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.800
But even without the presumption of guilt,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.280
if someone tells me James Charles is accused

07:57.280 --> 07:59.440
of toxic and manipulative behavior,

07:59.440 --> 08:02.080
I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.800
And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics,

08:04.800 --> 08:07.040
and whatever my imagination comes up with

08:07.040 --> 08:08.720
is likely going to be worse

08:08.720 --> 08:10.800
than whatever he's actually accused of.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.160
Also, the specific accusation that he tried

08:14.160 --> 08:16.720
to trick straight men into thinking they're gay

08:16.720 --> 08:20.240
is self-evidently kind of questionable.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.720
How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?

08:22.720 --> 08:24.000
If you find out, let me know.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.120
It's bad, I'm bad, I'm super bad.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.440
This is not a problem that straight men

08:29.440 --> 08:30.800
usually seem to have.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.520
At the very least, it requires further explanation.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.880
It's the kind of story that sounds

08:34.880 --> 08:36.320
like it has more than one side.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.880
So I'm immediately gonna feel a little bit skeptical

08:38.880 --> 08:40.000
of the accusation.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.440
And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.920
because this accusation is setting off

08:45.920 --> 08:47.840
my homophobia detection alarm.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.400
Leave the gays alone.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.640
But I'm not gonna have an opportunity

08:52.640 --> 08:54.800
to pick up on the potential homophobia

08:54.800 --> 08:56.240
and be skeptical of it,

08:56.240 --> 08:58.160
if all I've heard about the situation

08:58.160 --> 09:00.880
is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.320
And I also wanna point out a linguistic shift

09:04.320 --> 09:05.440
that's happening here.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.040
When the claim was James Charles

09:07.040 --> 09:08.400
tried to trick straight men,

09:08.400 --> 09:11.360
the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.400
So what we're criticizing here is James's behavior.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.200
We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,

09:17.200 --> 09:18.800
trying to trick straight men.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.200
But once the claim morphs into James Charles

09:21.200 --> 09:23.440
is toxic and manipulative,

09:23.440 --> 09:26.640
the verb in the sentence is is, to be.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.280
So these adjectives are characteristics of James,

09:29.280 --> 09:31.600
and it's now not his actions we're criticizing,

09:31.600 --> 09:35.920
but his personality, his toxicity, his manipulativeness.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.040
This is what I'll call cancel culture trope three,

09:39.040 --> 09:40.080
essentialism.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.520
Essentialism is when we go

09:41.520 --> 09:43.680
from criticizing a person's actions

09:43.680 --> 09:46.160
to criticizing the person themselves.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.400
We're not just saying they did bad things,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.560
we're saying they're a bad person.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.160
And that's what takes us from

09:52.160 --> 09:54.320
James Charles tried to trick straight men

09:54.320 --> 09:58.240
to James Charles is a sexual predator.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.880
So here, we're targeting James himself,

10:00.880 --> 10:04.160
not just his actions, but the type of person he is,

10:04.160 --> 10:06.560
a sexual predator.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.680
And we've also really escalated the accusation,

10:09.680 --> 10:11.200
because I don't know about you guys,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.600
but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.480
the image that comes to mind is a rapist

10:16.480 --> 10:19.680
or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss,

10:19.680 --> 10:21.440
not a teenage twink hung up

10:21.440 --> 10:22.880
on wanting to date straight guys.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.400
I mean, not that a person like that

10:24.400 --> 10:26.080
couldn't be a sexual predator,

10:26.080 --> 10:29.600
but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator

10:29.600 --> 10:32.240
is a fair summary of the accusation.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.920
So this seems to me like a pretty nasty

10:33.920 --> 10:36.080
and dishonest twisting of the story,

10:36.080 --> 10:38.640
and it happened instantaneously on Twitter.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.640
It totally dominated the conversation

10:40.640 --> 10:44.000
in a community of millions of people for weeks.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.200
In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers,

10:47.200 --> 10:49.760
and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.600
Not that anyone seems to care.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.600
In fact, most people seem to be enjoying his downfall.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.200
He was a teenage millionaire,

10:57.200 --> 10:59.200
a young, beautiful superstar,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.440
easy to envy, easy to resent,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.160
hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.560
What was the point of canceling James Charles?

11:06.560 --> 11:08.160
Did we want to teach him a lesson?

11:08.160 --> 11:10.320
Did we want him to learn from his mistakes

11:10.320 --> 11:11.920
and grow as a person?

11:11.920 --> 11:14.160
Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.000
Imagine actually caring.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.880
My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer

11:18.880 --> 11:21.200
was not sincerely outraged and hurt

11:21.200 --> 11:22.720
by their sincere belief

11:22.720 --> 11:25.040
that James Charles was a sexual predator.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.160
In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.200
This was a controversy manufactured from the top

11:31.200 --> 11:34.720
by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.160
I honestly think that most of the

11:36.160 --> 11:38.480
James Charles is a sexual predator crowd

11:39.200 --> 11:41.200
just wanted to bring him down a peg.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.720
Cancel culture trope four,

11:42.720 --> 11:45.600
pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.520
If you look at the world we live in,

11:47.520 --> 11:50.240
would you say that people are usually motivated

11:50.240 --> 11:54.000
by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.080
No, maybe not.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.680
Let's be real, America.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.880
We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags

12:00.880 --> 12:04.240
constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.360
For Tati, calling out James, this was really,

12:08.240 --> 12:10.480
it was about the hair vitamins, right?

12:10.480 --> 12:14.000
I think Sis was super salty that this millionaire kid

12:14.000 --> 12:15.920
who she had supported and helped

12:15.920 --> 12:18.800
had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand

12:18.800 --> 12:21.920
and accusing him of trying to trick straight men

12:21.920 --> 12:23.920
was just a twist of the knife.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.160
But moralism or intellectualism

12:26.160 --> 12:29.040
provide a phony pretext for the call-out.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.200
You can pretend you just want an apology.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.600
You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen

12:33.600 --> 12:35.280
who wants the person to improve.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.000
You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism

12:38.000 --> 12:39.200
when what you're really doing

12:39.200 --> 12:41.600
is attacking a person's career and reputation

12:41.600 --> 12:44.080
out of spite, envy, revenge.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.520
I mean, it could be any motivation.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.000
Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.600
spoiled little brat,

12:49.600 --> 12:53.440
and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face,

12:53.440 --> 12:54.880
at least for a few weeks.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.480
It's schadenfreude, right?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.160
This kind of petty sadism.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.920
Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.000
but not the most shameful either.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.360
And that's not to say that everyone

13:03.360 --> 13:05.600
canceling James Charles was insincere,

13:05.600 --> 13:08.080
but there's a world of difference

13:08.080 --> 13:11.760
between cancel R. Kelly and cancel James Charles.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.600
And I'm interested to know

13:13.600 --> 13:16.080
how these two things came to look the same.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.600
When James was being canceled,

13:17.600 --> 13:19.680
I remember being kind of transfixed

13:19.680 --> 13:21.920
by the sight of his life and career

13:21.920 --> 13:24.560
falling from the sky, full tailspin,

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
black smoke spewing out.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.240
And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,

13:28.240 --> 13:30.240
lol, did you see James Charles is canceled?

13:30.240 --> 13:31.680
LOL, LOL, LOL.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.200
But I looked up at James and I said,

13:34.160 --> 13:37.680
oh God, that's gonna be me someday.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.120
Stay strong, sister.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.280
Don't let the bastards get you down.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.280
Let's switch over to White Claw.

13:45.280 --> 13:45.920
These are cute.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.040
These are fun.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.960
A little more of a feminine moment for me.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.920
They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.840
I'm not even wearing makeup.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.440
I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.960
Keep drinking, people.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.480
We're gonna make it through this together.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.480
So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology

14:04.480 --> 14:07.120
when I was looking into the James Charles canceling,

14:07.120 --> 14:09.200
and I found a bunch of tweets

14:09.200 --> 14:12.000
referencing earlier James Charles scandals.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.680
Y'all forgiving James Charles?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.280
He's still a transphobe.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.720
Y'all are acting like just because

14:16.720 --> 14:18.160
James Charles has receipts,

14:18.160 --> 14:20.480
he's no longer a racist transphobe.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.480
Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,

14:24.480 --> 14:26.400
and a sexual predator.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.520
A white woman.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.920
Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncanceled.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.280
So according to Twitter,

14:31.280 --> 14:34.400
James Charles is not only a sexual predator,

14:34.400 --> 14:38.240
he's also a racist and a transphobe.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.920
That sounds pretty serious.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.600
Let's investigate.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.760
We'll start with the transphobia allocation.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.480
Cockerels of the jury, exhibit A.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.680
So you're not even full gay?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.040
I mean, no, there have been girls in the past

14:49.040 --> 14:50.560
that I've thought were really, really beautiful.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.560
There's also been trans guys in the past, too,

14:52.560 --> 14:55.520
that I was really, really into for a moment in time.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.240
And I oop.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.320
As I say on Twitter, yikes.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.680
This ain't it, chief.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.640
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.800
Maybe don't be transphobic.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.920
Disappointing.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.560
So James did fuck up here.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.560
The problem is he's suggesting

15:10.560 --> 15:14.080
that being attracted to trans men makes him less gay,

15:14.080 --> 15:17.200
which implies that trans men aren't really men,

15:17.200 --> 15:19.280
which is at odds with the way trans men

15:19.280 --> 15:20.480
understand themselves.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.280
So this does deserve criticism, no doubt, no doubt.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.960
However, what I see when I look at this clip of James

15:26.960 --> 15:31.040
is not a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.640
I see a very young person who's still working

15:34.640 --> 15:36.960
on understanding his own sexuality

15:36.960 --> 15:39.040
and is trying to figure out

15:39.040 --> 15:41.600
where his attraction to trans men fits into that.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.480
And it seems to me that the proportionate response

15:44.480 --> 15:48.720
to that situation is for someone to take James's side

15:48.720 --> 15:50.160
and explain to him,

15:50.160 --> 15:53.600
look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,

15:53.600 --> 15:55.760
and here are some tips on how to avoid

15:55.760 --> 15:57.360
saying that kind of thing in the future.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.960
You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.600
Not understanding someone is not the same

16:03.600 --> 16:05.200
as wanting them dead.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.200
Of course, there are committed bigots

16:07.200 --> 16:09.440
who it's just a waste of time to engage with,

16:09.440 --> 16:12.160
but sometimes just talking to someone

16:12.160 --> 16:15.120
with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.200
But that's not what cancel culture does.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.520
Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation

16:21.520 --> 16:24.560
to the highest possible level of conflict.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.480
So by abstraction, we get

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
James Charles made transphobic comments.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.480
And by essentialism, we get

16:30.480 --> 16:33.840
James Charles is a transphobe.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.680
We don't give him a chance to reflect.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.080
We don't give him an opportunity to learn.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.360
We go straight to branding him a bigot.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.280
Nonetheless, that same week,

16:43.280 --> 16:46.320
James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,

16:46.320 --> 16:48.560
regardless of whatever my intentions were,

16:48.560 --> 16:51.600
that came across as me saying I'm not fully gay

16:51.600 --> 16:53.440
because I have been with a trans man.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.160
And that is absolutely, first of all, not true.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.160
Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.080
But that stereotype and implication

17:00.080 --> 17:02.000
is really, really dangerous.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.080
And I'm very, very sorry.

17:04.080 --> 17:06.320
If you are a trans man, you are a man.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.640
If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.400
You are valid in your identity.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.640
Could you ask for a better apology?

17:12.640 --> 17:15.120
Like he not only apologizes for what he said,

17:15.120 --> 17:17.600
but he also demonstrates a clear understanding

17:17.600 --> 17:19.280
of why it was wrong.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.200
So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.240
Of course not.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.160
Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.920
Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,

17:31.920 --> 17:34.480
no matter how convincingly written or delivered.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.000
And of course, an insincere apology is further proof

17:38.000 --> 17:41.360
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.360
Now sometimes, a good apology

17:43.360 --> 17:45.520
will calm things down for a while.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.440
But the next time there's a scandal,

17:47.440 --> 17:50.160
the original accusation will be raised again,

17:50.160 --> 17:51.920
as if you never apologized.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.800
And that's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,

17:54.800 --> 17:59.440
when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.000
And that's to say nothing of this racism

18:02.000 --> 18:03.120
I've been hearing about.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.480
Here's the receipts.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.760
Exhibit B.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.800
In February 2017, when James was much less famous

18:08.800 --> 18:10.640
than he is now, he tweeted,

18:10.640 --> 18:12.560
I can't believe we're going to Africa today.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.480
OMG, what if we get Ebola?

18:14.480 --> 18:15.360
James, we're fine.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.440
We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.240
Okay, well, that's a little insensitive maybe.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.880
It's not really something an influencer should tweet.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.840
And fear of disease associated with Africa,

18:28.720 --> 18:32.560
I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area

18:32.560 --> 18:34.320
as certain racist tropes.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.120
But clearly, this was intended as a joke

18:37.120 --> 18:40.880
about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.440
And anyway, he did apologize, saying,

18:43.440 --> 18:46.800
as a white cis male, I recognize my privilege

18:46.800 --> 18:49.280
and would never want to take that for granted,

18:49.280 --> 18:50.560
but I fucked up.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.800
I feel awful for posting what I said.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.840
I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.200
And James hasn't made a habit

18:57.200 --> 19:00.240
of making jokes like that ever since, so.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.720
Is this one tweet from two years ago

19:02.720 --> 19:05.280
that he apologized for, on its own,

19:05.280 --> 19:09.920
enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist?

19:09.920 --> 19:13.040
Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.520
Abstraction takes us from two years ago,

19:15.520 --> 19:17.440
James Charles made a joke that referenced

19:17.440 --> 19:19.680
his fear of getting Ebola in Africa

19:19.680 --> 19:22.720
to James Charles made a racist joke.

19:22.720 --> 19:27.520
And then essentialism takes us to James Charles is a racist.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.320
I don't think that's racist.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.720
Look, I want to pause to say,

19:36.720 --> 19:40.000
I really do believe in social justice,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.840
at least as much as trash like me believes in anything.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.640
And believe me, I am well aware that jokes,

19:46.640 --> 19:49.920
irony and even complaints about cancel culture

19:49.920 --> 19:53.600
are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.720
The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video

19:56.720 --> 19:59.680
about how far-right racists use jokes and memes

19:59.680 --> 20:03.040
and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage

20:03.040 --> 20:05.760
their hateful beliefs and make them more palatable

20:05.760 --> 20:07.280
to a wider audience.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.560
So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern

20:10.560 --> 20:13.280
for anti-racism and anti-transphobia,

20:13.280 --> 20:17.360
as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture

20:17.360 --> 20:20.160
is often just a conservative red herring

20:20.160 --> 20:22.240
used to shut down any and all complaints

20:22.240 --> 20:24.080
about racism or transphobia.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.840
But I've also become very disillusioned

20:27.840 --> 20:30.160
with the way these accusations are thrown around

20:30.160 --> 20:32.880
so frivolously on social media.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.280
By the way, they're used to escalate conflict

20:35.280 --> 20:37.280
instead of promote understanding.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.480
And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized

20:40.480 --> 20:43.840
to destroy people who have made mistakes

20:43.840 --> 20:46.960
but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.360
Now maybe you're thinking, destroyed?

20:49.360 --> 20:50.960
What do you mean destroyed?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.720
James is a 20-year-old millionaire

20:52.720 --> 20:54.960
on his way to owning his own makeup empire,

20:54.960 --> 20:57.760
and you are completely correct.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.800
If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,

21:00.800 --> 21:04.080
then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.840
The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters,

21:07.840 --> 21:10.720
and they can set you back a few million subscribers

21:10.720 --> 21:13.200
and a lot of emotional turmoil,

21:13.200 --> 21:16.800
but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.160
But here's the thing, what if you're not James Charles?

21:20.160 --> 21:21.840
What if you're a small creator?

21:21.920 --> 21:24.720
What if you can't afford public relations help?

21:24.720 --> 21:27.040
What if you belong to a marginalized community,

21:27.040 --> 21:29.280
and you rely on that community for support?

21:29.280 --> 21:32.240
Well in that case, it's a whole different story.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.840
Let's Irish up this coffee.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.600
Shaken, not stirred.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.720
Spilled it all over my pussy.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.640
That's good.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.160
Booze and coffee is a good combination.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.080
I'm feeling amped right now.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.360
I'm feeling hyped.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.600
So this is the part in the video where I should admit

21:55.600 --> 21:57.760
that I'm not just a casual observer here.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.600
At the time of making this video,

21:59.600 --> 22:01.840
sweaty, I'm super canceled.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.800
You know, I try to make videos

22:02.800 --> 22:04.880
that are both informative and entertaining.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.560
So in this video, the information is

22:06.560 --> 22:08.160
you get to learn about cancel culture,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.080
and the entertainment is

22:10.080 --> 22:12.160
you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.840
Let's get started.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.520
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.400
Hey, how are you?

22:16.400 --> 22:18.080
God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber

22:18.080 --> 22:20.480
who would resort to making videos about my own drama,

22:20.480 --> 22:23.200
but things have gotten to a point.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.600
I feel like I cannot continue this channel

22:25.600 --> 22:26.960
until I spill some tea.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.560
So let's get started.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.960
Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.640
I've never talked about this on my channel before,

22:32.640 --> 22:35.280
so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

22:35.280 --> 22:38.000
but I am in fact a transgender woman,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.160
which may come as a big shock to many of you

22:40.160 --> 22:41.920
since I'm 100% real fesh.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.680
I get comments all the time from like very solemn people,

22:45.680 --> 22:49.840
like, guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.880
Great work, detective.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.000
You cracked the case.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.680
You're doing very good, sweetie.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.520
Very, very good.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.360
But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,

22:59.360 --> 23:01.440
I am a prime target for cancellation,

23:01.440 --> 23:04.400
and I have been canceled many, many times.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.600
And we're gonna talk about some of the things

23:05.600 --> 23:06.720
I've been canceled for

23:06.720 --> 23:08.560
and some of the things I've been criticized for,

23:08.560 --> 23:10.880
and the difference between criticism and canceling,

23:10.880 --> 23:12.800
because yes, there is a difference.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.200
As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes

23:15.200 --> 23:18.400
because despite how I look, I am not a literal goddess,

23:18.400 --> 23:22.800
and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.560
However, where I believe that criticism of me

23:26.560 --> 23:29.920
is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize

23:29.920 --> 23:31.600
because here at ContraPoints Industries,

23:31.600 --> 23:34.080
we are not in the business of serving bullshit.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.200
So the reason for my current cancellation is,

23:37.840 --> 23:40.960
in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,

23:40.960 --> 23:43.760
I cast transsexual porn star Buck Angel

23:43.760 --> 23:45.200
in the role of John Waters.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.800
And yes, it's a much better story

23:46.800 --> 23:48.240
than the hair vitamin debacle,

23:48.240 --> 23:51.120
so notify the drama channels, put in a good word for me,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.600
because sweetie, I'm not here to make friends.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.400
I'm here to win.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.200
So basically I'm canceled for collaborating with Buck Angel,

23:57.200 --> 23:59.440
and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel

23:59.440 --> 24:01.520
is a horrible person.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.680
And so my collaboration with Buck Angel

24:03.680 --> 24:07.280
is evidence that I too am a horrible person.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.960
Cancel culture trope six,

24:08.960 --> 24:11.280
the transitive property of cancellation.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.440
Cancellation is infectious.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.520
If you associate with a canceled person,

24:15.520 --> 24:17.600
the cancellation rubs off.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.760
It's like gonorrhea, except doxycycline

24:19.760 --> 24:21.360
won't save you this time, sweetie.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.840
Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,

24:23.840 --> 24:28.160
on whether Buck Angel is, in fact, a horrible person.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.000
So who is Buck Angel?

24:30.000 --> 24:33.200
Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.120
He grew up in a world where there was not anything

24:35.120 --> 24:37.040
like the visibility and access to information

24:37.040 --> 24:38.560
about transition we have today,

24:38.560 --> 24:40.720
and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system

24:40.720 --> 24:43.200
in place for people who wanted to transition.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.680
In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient

24:45.680 --> 24:47.120
his doctor had ever treated.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.160
In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,

24:50.160 --> 24:52.720
his gimmick at the time being the man with a pussy.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.320
But he also became an activist.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.800
He wanted to create more positive trans representation

24:56.800 --> 24:57.840
within the porn world,

24:57.840 --> 24:59.920
and from there he became a more general educator

24:59.920 --> 25:01.440
and advocate for trans people.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.360
I first heard about him in the early 2010s

25:03.360 --> 25:05.520
when I was doing some Googling

25:05.520 --> 25:08.240
about some little gender issues I was having myself,

25:08.240 --> 25:10.400
although I ended up deciding to remain a female.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.560
And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people

25:12.560 --> 25:13.600
I'd ever heard about,

25:13.600 --> 25:15.040
and he made an impact on me in part

25:15.040 --> 25:16.720
because you take one look at him and you think,

25:16.720 --> 25:19.040
honey, that's a man, but he was born a woman.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.600
You can do that.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.320
So it's not like he inspired me to transition or anything,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.240
it's just, it was one of many moments

25:26.240 --> 25:27.920
along my whole entire gender journey.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.320
So I had positive feelings about Trampot,

25:30.320 --> 25:32.320
that's what he calls himself, from back then,

25:32.320 --> 25:33.520
and then a few months ago,

25:33.520 --> 25:36.640
when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised

25:36.640 --> 25:38.960
over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,

25:38.960 --> 25:40.320
we'll get to that one later,

25:40.320 --> 25:43.200
I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.840
Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.680
It is okay that you lash out at me.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.960
You do this because I am you

25:48.960 --> 25:51.200
and you are reflecting your self-hate to me.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.280
I am strong and will be here for you forever

25:53.280 --> 25:54.400
and no matter what.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.440
This is my intention as a human being, to help others.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.640
Love, Buck Angel.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.800
And then the caption, suffering.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.360
That is why the trans community lashes out at each other.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.280
I am very aware of the hate towards me

26:05.280 --> 26:06.640
by some in the community.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.200
They hate on me and others because they are hurt.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.520
And those were exactly the words I needed to hear

26:11.520 --> 26:12.400
at that moment.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.200
So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me

26:15.200 --> 26:16.480
and he said, I love you.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.480
And I was like, senpai noticed me.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.240
And so I said, I love you back.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.080
Then when I was working on Opulence,

26:22.080 --> 26:25.680
I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.000
And it was my co-director, Theron, who suggested,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.320
don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.240
And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.440
Let's see if he wants to do it.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.160
And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel

26:36.160 --> 26:38.160
as John Waters in the video credits.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.040
A trans icon playing a gay icon.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.880
In my head, it was just so, well, iconic.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.320
So I got in touch with Buck about the line

26:46.320 --> 26:48.000
and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.200
So here it is.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.080
The 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.120
One must remember, there is such a thing

26:55.120 --> 26:58.240
as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

26:58.240 --> 27:02.000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.400
That's it, children.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.000
That's why mommy's canceled.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.280
Now, I was aware at the time

27:07.280 --> 27:09.200
that trans Twitter hated Buck Angel,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.040
but my thinking was, well,

27:11.040 --> 27:13.680
trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity

27:13.680 --> 27:15.200
and they certainly hate me.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.360
So I wasn't gonna let that stop me.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.280
Little did I know quite how vicious

27:19.280 --> 27:20.560
things were about to get.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.480
Now, so far, I've been telling this story

27:22.480 --> 27:23.600
from my point of view,

27:23.600 --> 27:26.400
but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.400
So I want to pause and contextualize

27:28.400 --> 27:31.280
why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much

27:31.280 --> 27:32.640
they're willing to cancel anyone

27:32.640 --> 27:34.080
who even associates with him.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.200
Basically, it all goes back

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
to this old debate in the trans community

27:37.200 --> 27:38.880
known today in Tumblr lingo

27:38.880 --> 27:41.440
as truscum versus transtrenders.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.120
So truscum are trans people

27:43.120 --> 27:45.520
who distinguish between true trans people

27:45.520 --> 27:46.720
and fake trans people,

27:46.720 --> 27:49.040
who they call trenders or too-cutes.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.520
Usually truscum think that what it is to be trans

27:51.520 --> 27:53.840
is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.440
to pursue a medical transition

27:55.440 --> 27:57.040
involving hormones and surgery,

27:57.040 --> 27:58.640
and to socially re-assimilate

27:58.640 --> 28:00.240
into your target binary gender,

28:00.240 --> 28:01.440
so male or female.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.000
Anyone who's not that, according to truscum,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.080
must either be a confused teenager,

28:06.080 --> 28:07.600
someone just trying to get attention,

28:07.600 --> 28:09.120
someone mistaking their trauma

28:09.120 --> 28:11.040
or their fetish for being trans,

28:11.040 --> 28:12.640
in a word, a trender.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.480
So that's a viz of transness

28:14.480 --> 28:16.640
that usually excludes non-binary people

28:16.640 --> 28:17.840
as well as people who don't want

28:17.840 --> 28:19.920
to medically transition for whatever reason,

28:19.920 --> 28:20.720
and for that reason,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.680
this view is sometimes also called transmedicalism,

28:23.680 --> 28:25.760
truscum obviously being the derogatory term

28:25.760 --> 28:26.480
for these people.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.680
So truscum are very hated by a lot of trans people

28:29.680 --> 28:30.800
because their viewpoint

28:30.800 --> 28:32.960
is that not all trans identities are valid,

28:32.960 --> 28:36.320
and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be truscum.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.080
So the next question to ask is,

28:38.080 --> 28:39.360
is this true?

28:39.360 --> 28:42.000
Is Buck Angel, in fact, truscum?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.640
Now my honest answer to that question is,

28:44.640 --> 28:45.440
I don't know.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.800
He's certainly said some things

28:46.800 --> 28:48.480
that sound like things truscum say,

28:48.480 --> 28:49.280
I'll give you that.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.560
A point he likes to make a lot

28:50.560 --> 28:53.440
is that he's transsexual, not transgender,

28:53.440 --> 28:54.880
and the difference between those terms

28:54.880 --> 28:56.480
is sometimes defined as,

28:56.480 --> 28:58.240
transsexual implies that you want

28:58.240 --> 28:59.920
to pursue medical transition,

28:59.920 --> 29:01.360
so hormones and surgery,

29:01.360 --> 29:03.680
and transgender doesn't imply that.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.880
And people associate this

29:04.880 --> 29:07.600
I'm transsexual, not transgender thing with truscum

29:07.600 --> 29:10.480
because truscum often call themselves transsexuals

29:10.480 --> 29:12.640
and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual

29:12.640 --> 29:13.920
isn't really trans.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.840
And often those people will be very mean

29:15.840 --> 29:17.360
to people they call trenders,

29:17.360 --> 29:19.520
especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers

29:19.520 --> 29:21.520
like Vanessa LeBlanc

29:21.520 --> 29:23.520
and Too Cute Smasher 9000.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.520
Too Cute Smasher 9000.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.040
Roast me back, Calvin, I dare you.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.440
But I think it's important to keep in mind

29:35.440 --> 29:37.520
that the term truscum is a product

29:37.520 --> 29:39.520
of the 2014 Tumblr wars,

29:39.520 --> 29:41.200
and trying to apply it to trans people

29:41.200 --> 29:44.320
of an older generation can sometimes be misleading.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.840
Like when Buck Angel transitioned,

29:45.840 --> 29:48.960
the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,

29:48.960 --> 29:50.480
and he still identifies that way.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.000
So when younger trans people tell him

29:52.000 --> 29:54.080
it's wrong to use the word transsexual,

29:54.080 --> 29:56.160
he feels like these ungrateful millennials

29:56.160 --> 29:57.840
are invalidating his identity,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.000
and I do understand where he's coming from with that.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.720
But I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people

30:02.720 --> 30:04.320
are skeptical about Buck.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.520
Like he says again and again,

30:05.520 --> 30:07.520
I'm transsexual, not transgender,

30:07.520 --> 30:09.520
like don't mix me up with those people.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.360
And that eagerness to separate himself

30:11.360 --> 30:12.880
from transgender people,

30:12.880 --> 30:14.960
it comes across as hostility.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.640
Like I don't think he's ever actually said

30:16.640 --> 30:18.400
that nonbinary people aren't valid,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.960
but I personally don't like that he seems like

30:20.960 --> 30:22.880
he wants to distance himself from them.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.560
And that's my disagreement with Buck.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.200
It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
because I don't really see him doing that.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.560
And if he was doing that,

30:30.560 --> 30:31.520
I would have seen it,

30:31.520 --> 30:32.720
because for the last two months,

30:32.720 --> 30:34.000
a lot of people have been doing nothing

30:34.000 --> 30:36.400
but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.040
But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,

30:39.040 --> 30:42.000
and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.800
it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.960
And I hope he listens to this criticism,

30:46.960 --> 30:48.320
because I think it would be cool

30:48.320 --> 30:50.000
if he got better about this.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Of course, Buck is technically right

30:52.000 --> 30:53.680
that there are different kinds of trans people,

30:53.680 --> 30:54.880
and I agree it's important

30:54.880 --> 30:56.560
that we can make those distinctions

30:56.560 --> 30:58.720
and talk about the differences when they're relevant.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.120
But I also think that as a community,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.680
trans people benefit from unity, not division.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.880
Like, if you have an employer

31:04.880 --> 31:06.960
who discriminates against trans people,

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
they're not gonna care if you're transsexual,

31:08.960 --> 31:11.680
transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.840
They're gonna discriminate against you regardless.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.520
So we're all in this together,

31:15.520 --> 31:17.280
and there's a lot of disagreements among us,

31:17.280 --> 31:19.440
and we often don't get along so well.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.680
But politically, I think we should work together

31:21.680 --> 31:22.720
as much as possible

31:22.720 --> 31:24.640
instead of splitting into little factions,

31:24.640 --> 31:27.440
because we share most of the same interests.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.200
And I think the best way to do that

31:29.200 --> 31:31.200
is to build bridges instead of burning them.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.960
And that's why I'm willing to work with people

31:32.960 --> 31:35.760
like Buck Angel, who I have some disagreements with.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.520
It creates a connection, you know?

31:37.520 --> 31:40.560
And having that connection can lead to communication

31:40.560 --> 31:41.680
and build understanding.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.520
Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.120
I am very lonely.

31:46.000 --> 31:46.640
It's not a joke.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.080
It's true.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.840
Now, I get that some people have views

31:49.840 --> 31:50.960
that are so harmful

31:50.960 --> 31:53.600
that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.000
But in any case, I didn't even give Buck a platform

31:56.000 --> 31:57.360
to share his opinions.

31:57.440 --> 32:00.320
I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.080
A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,

32:02.080 --> 32:04.640
why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?

32:04.640 --> 32:06.560
Well, first of all, I don't actually know John,

32:06.560 --> 32:08.800
but I just have a feeling he would write me off

32:08.800 --> 32:11.280
as some kind of tranny millennial SJW.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.880
Like, why is Buck Angel canceled but John Waters isn't?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.640
Well, because trans Twitter does not know

32:16.640 --> 32:17.840
who John Waters is.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.280
And let's try to keep it that way.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.880
I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine

32:20.880 --> 32:21.840
who knows John,

32:21.840 --> 32:23.680
and he told me that he and John

32:23.680 --> 32:26.320
have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.160
So, plot twist.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.840
Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me

32:31.840 --> 32:33.920
unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum

32:33.920 --> 32:35.760
and apologize for ever working with him.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.440
But I'm not gonna do that,

32:37.440 --> 32:40.240
because I don't think it would be the right thing to do,

32:40.240 --> 32:42.640
and doing it just to get myself uncanceled

32:42.640 --> 32:43.600
would be cowardly.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.080
I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree

32:46.080 --> 32:47.520
with Buck's divisive rhetoric

32:47.520 --> 32:49.600
about transsexual versus transgender.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.160
I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella

32:52.160 --> 32:54.480
instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.080
And I'm happy to hear out the perspective

32:56.080 --> 32:58.000
of non-binary people who don't trust him,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.760
because I totally get where they're coming from

32:59.760 --> 33:01.120
and I think that's valid.

33:01.120 --> 33:04.640
But I also respect the decades of good activism

33:04.640 --> 33:06.720
Buck Angel has done for trans people,

33:06.720 --> 33:08.640
and I am grateful to him for that.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.600
And in light of that,

33:09.600 --> 33:11.760
I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt

33:11.760 --> 33:13.040
about where his heart is,

33:13.040 --> 33:15.600
and express my criticism in a more measured way

33:15.600 --> 33:18.000
than just attacking who he is as a person.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.920
But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,

33:21.920 --> 33:24.160
because this is the strategy they've chosen

33:24.160 --> 33:27.280
to establish that I am a horrible person.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.640
And if the true scum allegation

33:28.640 --> 33:30.080
isn't strong enough to prove it,

33:30.080 --> 33:32.720
oh, they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on

33:32.720 --> 33:34.080
to hold up their conclusion.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.800
For example, here's a tweet claiming,

33:36.800 --> 33:39.280
Natalie's trying so fucking hard

33:39.280 --> 33:41.600
to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did

33:41.600 --> 33:43.200
was write a few iffy tweets,

33:43.200 --> 33:46.320
and that's just so fucking far from the truth.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.360
Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
outing a trans woman against her will,

33:51.360 --> 33:52.640
with a specific intent

33:52.640 --> 33:55.440
of causing her physical, emotional, and professional harm.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.880
The shorter way of saying that

33:56.880 --> 33:58.560
is that he wanted to make her suffer,

33:58.560 --> 34:00.560
and she very well could have been killed.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.080
Yikes.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.360
This ain't it, chief.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.240
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.480
Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.520
Disappointing.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.040
It sounds pretty serious.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.880
Let's investigate.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.480
Here's what I've managed to piece together.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.200
Scene one.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.520
The year is 2003, Los Angeles,

34:17.520 --> 34:19.280
where the movie world, the porn world,

34:19.280 --> 34:20.960
and the BDSM scene come together

34:20.960 --> 34:24.400
in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal, and transsexualism.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.280
La la land.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.960
Dramatis Personae.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.360
Buck Angel, transsexual porn star.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.880
Ilsa Strix, dominatrix, then-wife of Buck Angel.

34:32.880 --> 34:36.400
Lana Wachowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix,

34:36.400 --> 34:39.040
at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.960
The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix

34:40.960 --> 34:42.880
and Buck Angel's marriage ended

34:42.880 --> 34:45.520
after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,

34:45.520 --> 34:47.040
who was not yet out as trans.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.520
So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,

34:49.600 --> 34:52.080
and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,

34:52.080 --> 34:53.680
told a series of magazines

34:53.680 --> 34:56.000
that this celebrity director Wachowski

34:56.000 --> 34:58.720
was a crossdresser who had stolen his wife,

34:58.720 --> 35:01.920
which I guess was the information he had at the time.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.680
So is that outing a trans woman against her will?

35:05.680 --> 35:07.520
Well, in retrospect, it seems like it,

35:07.520 --> 35:08.960
though that may not be what he thought

35:08.960 --> 35:10.320
he was doing at the time.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.240
But to really get to the bottom of this,

35:12.240 --> 35:13.440
we have to do some digging.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.600
We have to trawl through the dirty details

35:15.600 --> 35:17.680
of trans people's personal histories,

35:17.680 --> 35:19.280
which I've noticed is one of the internet's

35:19.280 --> 35:20.720
favorite activities.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.720
So I actually went on eBay,

35:22.720 --> 35:27.120
and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991, January 2006,

35:27.120 --> 35:28.880
and I'm finally able to reveal

35:28.880 --> 35:33.920
that the seller canceled the order.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.520
God damn it!

35:35.520 --> 35:37.840
But I was finally able to track down

35:37.840 --> 35:39.680
and translate a Spanish version

35:39.680 --> 35:40.800
of the Rolling Stone article

35:40.800 --> 35:42.080
from the Wayback Machine,

35:42.080 --> 35:45.600
and I'm finally able to expose the truth.

35:45.680 --> 35:46.180
Stop.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.880
Freeze exactly where you are.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.160
Take a look at yourself

35:50.160 --> 35:51.680
and what all of us have been doing

35:51.680 --> 35:52.960
for the last 30 seconds.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
Who does this behavior remind you of?

35:54.960 --> 35:57.280
If your answer is social justice advocates

35:57.280 --> 35:58.640
fighting for trans equality,

35:59.200 --> 36:00.640
you are incorrect.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.240
If your answer is creepy stalkers

36:02.240 --> 36:03.280
who hate trans people,

36:05.360 --> 36:07.680
I am very suspicious of anyone

36:07.680 --> 36:09.680
whose online behavior prompts me

36:09.680 --> 36:11.920
to dig through articles full of dead names

36:11.920 --> 36:13.920
and sordid scandals involving trans people

36:13.920 --> 36:15.600
from almost two decades ago.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.000
This is very similar to techniques

36:18.000 --> 36:20.800
used against trans people by internet fascists.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.480
So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone

36:22.480 --> 36:24.400
pushing this kind of investigation.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.760
How can you tell the difference

36:25.760 --> 36:27.520
between a trans anarcho-socialist

36:27.520 --> 36:28.880
with an anime avatar

36:28.880 --> 36:30.720
and a Nazi pretending to be

36:30.720 --> 36:33.280
a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?

36:33.280 --> 36:35.200
Well, you can't.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.600
Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,

36:37.600 --> 36:39.600
whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.680
So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,

36:41.680 --> 36:43.680
or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me

36:43.680 --> 36:46.800
and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason

36:46.800 --> 36:48.480
they want me to publicly dig up

36:48.480 --> 36:50.720
their 17-year-old divorce drama,

36:50.720 --> 36:53.600
this is none of my fucking business.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.120
And it's none of yours either,

36:55.120 --> 36:57.440
so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms

36:57.440 --> 36:58.160
where you belong.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.080
Let's Irish up this tea.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.840
Doesn't work as well with tea.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.400
So setting aside any tabloid drama

37:16.400 --> 37:19.120
that may have happened during the Bush administration,

37:20.320 --> 37:22.400
I'm saying this in the cuntiest way

37:22.960 --> 37:24.480
and they deserve it.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.840
They fucking deserve the cuntiness.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.440
I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.400
I'm a lady.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.120
She's a woman.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.520
The main argument against me

37:35.520 --> 37:37.200
usually references a collage

37:37.200 --> 37:39.360
of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.520
And this is supposed to be definitive evidence

37:41.520 --> 37:43.600
that he is a horrible person

37:43.600 --> 37:46.240
and therefore that I am a horrible person

37:46.240 --> 37:47.840
for collaborating with him.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.080
Well, here's the thing though.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.400
A collage of problematic tweets

37:52.400 --> 37:54.160
does not define a person.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.800
And I'm very used to being defined that way myself

37:56.800 --> 37:58.960
so I know how unfair it can be.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.440
Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,

38:01.440 --> 38:02.480
a lot of people on Twitter

38:02.480 --> 38:04.240
were already calling me truscum.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.640
That's been going on a year and a half now.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.560
And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,

38:08.560 --> 38:09.840
a bunch of people respond saying

38:09.840 --> 38:11.040
Natalie is truscum,

38:11.040 --> 38:12.400
Natalie is a transmedicalist,

38:12.400 --> 38:14.240
Natalie hates non-binary people,

38:14.240 --> 38:15.520
and you should really think

38:15.520 --> 38:17.040
what kind of message you're sending

38:17.040 --> 38:19.040
to your trans and non-binary followers

38:19.040 --> 38:20.560
by platforming her.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.080
And if the person defends me

38:22.080 --> 38:23.840
or argues back in any way,

38:23.840 --> 38:24.560
they say,

38:24.560 --> 38:26.400
I can't believe you're ignoring

38:26.400 --> 38:29.120
the valid concerns of marginalized people.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.400
You know, they're weaponizing

38:30.400 --> 38:32.960
their marginalized status as trans people

38:32.960 --> 38:36.320
to isolate and attack another trans person.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.400
And sometimes this stuff gets to my head too.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.600
I start asking myself,

38:39.600 --> 38:41.520
wait, am I a transmedicalist?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.520
Do I really believe all these awful things

38:43.520 --> 38:44.640
they say I believe?

38:44.640 --> 38:46.000
But the answer is,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
no, I just don't.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.600
These things they're saying about me

38:49.600 --> 38:51.760
are 100% not true.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.320
You know,

38:52.320 --> 38:54.560
believe marginalized people is a norm

38:54.560 --> 38:56.560
that is encouraged in leftist spaces

38:56.560 --> 38:57.840
for good reason,

38:57.840 --> 39:00.480
much like believe victims or believe women.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.160
And these norms were established

39:02.160 --> 39:04.720
to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,

39:04.720 --> 39:07.440
which is not to listen to marginalized people

39:07.440 --> 39:09.280
or to victims or to women.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
But any norm can be abused.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.880
And the blunt fact of the matter is,

39:13.520 --> 39:16.560
sometimes marginalized people are wrong.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.120
Sometimes people calling themselves victims

39:19.120 --> 39:22.000
are obscuring a more complicated situation.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.960
And it's even happened once or twice

39:24.960 --> 39:27.120
that a woman has lied.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.600
And the accusation that I'm truscum

39:29.600 --> 39:31.920
is simply false.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.800
I mean, first of all,

39:33.360 --> 39:35.680
I don't even think of my own transgenderism

39:35.680 --> 39:36.880
as a medical disorder,

39:36.880 --> 39:38.240
much less everyone else's.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.680
I have of course collaborated with Dr. Spiegel et al,

39:41.680 --> 39:44.000
but I will not have my artistry

39:44.000 --> 39:45.840
reduced to mere medicine.

39:45.840 --> 39:49.360
Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people

39:49.360 --> 39:51.120
is just, no.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.340
No.

39:53.040 --> 39:53.540
Eh.

39:54.800 --> 39:55.360
Eh no.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.800
My thinking about trans identity

39:56.800 --> 39:59.680
has always been informed by non-binary people.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.680
I used to identify as non-binary myself

40:01.680 --> 40:03.360
before I medically transitioned,

40:03.360 --> 40:06.160
and some of the closest people to me in my life today

40:06.160 --> 40:07.760
are non-binary trans people,

40:07.760 --> 40:10.880
some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.400
It's complicated.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.960
I've also made at least five videos on this channel

40:14.960 --> 40:17.680
arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities

40:17.680 --> 40:19.520
going back more than three years.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.000
So that's five out of around 50 videos,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.120
or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,

40:25.120 --> 40:26.880
is about non-binary identity.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.040
A few months ago I even made a 30-minute video

40:29.040 --> 40:30.400
called Trans-Trenders,

40:30.400 --> 40:32.240
which uses character dialogue to show

40:32.240 --> 40:34.960
what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.040
But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter

40:37.040 --> 40:39.680
saying that I'm true scum who hates non-binary people,

40:39.680 --> 40:42.240
and their main piece of evidence for that

40:42.240 --> 40:44.560
is a collage of my problematic tweets.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.960
So let's take a look at that.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.560
Here's the three tweets that I usually see

40:48.560 --> 40:50.560
scrapbooked together as definitive proof

40:50.560 --> 40:52.480
that I hate non-binary people.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.040
This is the first one, from September 2018.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.120
Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread

40:57.120 --> 40:59.040
so you can't even see what I'm talking about.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.600
I'm sure this is not the experience of many enbies.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.200
Enbie means non-binary people.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.640
I leave it to them to articulate

41:04.640 --> 41:07.520
what enbie existence looks like in a binary world.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.000
I do not and I cannot speak for them,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.280
but surely an account,

41:11.280 --> 41:13.360
God, I used to write like such a nerd,

41:13.360 --> 41:16.080
but surely an account that begins and ends

41:16.080 --> 41:19.040
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

41:19.040 --> 41:20.080
is pretty weak.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.240
Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread

41:22.240 --> 41:24.640
that that tweet has been clipped out of,

41:24.640 --> 41:27.280
I was defending myself from accusations

41:27.280 --> 41:29.280
that my most recent video at the time,

41:29.280 --> 41:31.760
The Aesthetic, was anti-non-binary.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.640
In that video, there's a character named Justine

41:34.640 --> 41:35.840
who defends a version

41:35.840 --> 41:37.680
of the performativity theory of gender.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.120
And basically I made this video

41:39.120 --> 41:40.960
to express some angst I was feeling

41:40.960 --> 41:43.760
about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.

41:43.760 --> 41:47.040
This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,

41:47.040 --> 41:49.040
and I've already moved on in my thinking.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.480
At that time I was very, um,

41:51.600 --> 41:54.000
my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times

41:54.000 --> 41:55.520
or else I'm not really a woman.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.680
My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping

41:57.680 --> 41:59.680
with heterosexual men who resemble my father.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.760
Mmmmmm.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.600
And anyone who knows anything about trans women

42:03.600 --> 42:06.000
knows that most of us go through a stage like this

42:06.000 --> 42:09.200
at some point, and some YouTubers never get out of it.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.680
But personally, these days,

42:11.680 --> 42:13.680
it doesn't matter what I wear.

42:13.680 --> 42:17.280
It's when I dream their lilies dreams.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.000
Oh, dragging the Danish girl.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.120
Well, fuck the Danish.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.800
I could never abide that sort of person.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.240
We all know what I'm talking about.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.160
You can tell the whisky is getting to me

42:26.160 --> 42:29.200
because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.480
These things come out, you know.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.720
You get honest, you get real

42:33.440 --> 42:35.760
when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.600
Did I just fucking put lipstick

42:37.600 --> 42:39.600
outside of the fucking lip liner?

42:39.600 --> 42:41.040
This is all Lily's fault.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.320
Lily Alba.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.520
Fuck her dreams.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.520
The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,

42:45.520 --> 42:47.760
I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.360
And people will say that the fact that

42:49.360 --> 42:52.640
not every video I make references non-binary people

42:52.640 --> 42:54.960
is itself enbyphobic.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.600
As I've said, about one in 10 of my videos

42:57.600 --> 42:58.800
is about non-binary.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.160
But not all of them are.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.880
And I feel entitled to make some videos

43:04.880 --> 43:06.720
that are just about trans women.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.200
But still, some people on Twitter were saying

43:09.200 --> 43:12.080
that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.

43:12.080 --> 43:16.240
And because she maybe wins the fictional debate

43:16.240 --> 43:19.280
in the video, I, Natalie Wynn,

43:19.280 --> 43:21.840
am therefore a transmedicalist.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.040
Here's the thing, though.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.280
The performativity theory of gender,

43:25.280 --> 43:27.760
the one that Justine defends in that video,

43:27.840 --> 43:31.840
is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism

43:31.840 --> 43:33.760
as it is possible to be.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.960
Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,

43:36.960 --> 43:38.560
it's neurological, it's hormonal,

43:38.560 --> 43:40.240
it's diagnosable and treatable.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.160
Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,

43:44.160 --> 43:45.920
it's expression, it's performance,

43:45.920 --> 43:48.080
it's a social phenomenon.

43:48.080 --> 43:48.720
Phenomenon.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.840
Phenomenon.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.400
Phenomenon.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.480
Phenomenon.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.440
Phenomenon.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.320
Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria

43:56.320 --> 43:58.560
or to any kind of medical concept at all.

43:58.560 --> 44:02.560
So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,

44:02.560 --> 44:05.760
performativity is a kind of social constructionism.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.480
So these are exact opposite theories of gender.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.240
Are you following along, class?

44:10.240 --> 44:10.740
I'm not.

44:10.740 --> 44:14.160
I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.560
But some trans people felt invalidated

44:16.560 --> 44:18.720
by things Justine says in that video.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.760
And transmedicalism is another thing

44:21.760 --> 44:23.600
that makes them feel invalidated.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.800
So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist

44:26.800 --> 44:29.520
and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.

44:29.520 --> 44:33.040
And this is literally just bad media comprehension.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.720
Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video

44:36.720 --> 44:40.240
that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.320
And so much of the negative response to that video

44:42.320 --> 44:43.680
is just pure emotion.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.480
I always hear, I don't care what you intended,

44:46.480 --> 44:48.640
trans people were hurt by that video.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.400
You hurt trans people.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.600
But here's the thing,

44:51.600 --> 44:54.160
just because you were hurt by content I made

44:54.160 --> 44:56.240
doesn't mean that the content is bad

44:56.240 --> 44:58.400
or that I'm victimizing you in some way.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.760
I'll give you an example.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.760
I did a stream a couple years ago

45:01.760 --> 45:04.080
with a BDSM and kink activist.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.760
We were talking about various kinks

45:05.760 --> 45:10.080
and we got to DDLG, which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.

45:10.080 --> 45:14.400
Basically when consenting adults roleplay age difference

45:14.400 --> 45:16.480
and the power dynamic that comes with that.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.680
And me and this kink activist

45:17.680 --> 45:20.400
who are just casually discussing what DDLG is,

45:20.400 --> 45:23.760
what it isn't, when I noticed someone in the chat

45:23.760 --> 45:25.680
was starting to totally freak out.

45:25.680 --> 45:26.960
They were typing in all caps,

45:26.960 --> 45:30.320
like my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.080
Why are you defending my abuser?

45:32.080 --> 45:34.400
I can't believe you'd betray me like this.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.400
Please stop taking my abuser's side.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.760
Please stop, I'm begging you.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.560
This was actually really fucking upsetting to me

45:40.560 --> 45:43.280
because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.360
They were having a panic attack

45:45.360 --> 45:48.080
because they were having a trauma trigger reaction

45:48.080 --> 45:49.360
to this conversation.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.840
And I kept telling them to leave the stream

45:51.840 --> 45:54.400
and take care of themselves, but they wouldn't do it.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.520
So I had to block them and then later get in touch

45:57.520 --> 45:58.720
and make sure they were okay.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.240
Now, was their pain very real?

46:02.240 --> 46:02.880
Yes.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.600
Was it triggered by the content I was streaming?

46:06.240 --> 46:06.880
Yes.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.560
But does that mean I did anything wrong?

46:09.760 --> 46:10.480
No.

46:10.480 --> 46:13.120
Is it wrong to talk about kink in contexts

46:13.120 --> 46:15.280
where it's clear you're going to be talking about kink?

46:16.080 --> 46:16.800
No.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.120
But when you produce content online

46:19.120 --> 46:20.720
that's going to be viewed by thousands

46:20.720 --> 46:22.000
or millions of people,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.840
there's always some people out there

46:23.840 --> 46:25.520
who are going to be hurt by it.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.560
So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made

46:28.560 --> 46:29.840
is somehow immoral,

46:31.040 --> 46:32.880
I think you need more of an argument

46:32.880 --> 46:34.800
than just people were hurt.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.720
All right, back to the tweet.

46:36.720 --> 46:39.200
To this day, people quote tweet the sentence,

46:39.200 --> 46:41.040
but surely an account that begins and ends

46:41.040 --> 46:43.440
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

46:43.440 --> 46:44.320
is pretty weak.

46:44.320 --> 46:46.960
And they claim this is evidence that I'm true scum

46:47.040 --> 46:48.720
or that I think people have to prove

46:48.720 --> 46:50.160
their identities somehow,

46:50.160 --> 46:53.200
which is not at all what I was saying in that thread.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.880
What I was saying is,

46:54.880 --> 46:57.520
if you're trying to persuade a skeptic

46:57.520 --> 46:59.520
that trans identity is valid,

46:59.520 --> 47:01.280
simply saying I'm not a man

47:01.280 --> 47:02.960
because I don't identify as one

47:02.960 --> 47:04.480
isn't a very good argument,

47:04.480 --> 47:05.840
which it isn't.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that

47:07.840 --> 47:08.880
so far as I'm aware.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.760
That said, I do now disagree with the mindset

47:11.760 --> 47:13.440
I had when I tweeted this.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.920
Back then, I still delusionally believed

47:15.920 --> 47:18.080
that it was possible to rationally explain

47:18.080 --> 47:19.920
why trans identity is valid,

47:19.920 --> 47:22.400
and I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument

47:22.400 --> 47:24.320
than this is how I identify,

47:24.320 --> 47:27.040
you have to believe me, no further questions.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.640
But I no longer believe there can be

47:28.640 --> 47:31.200
any rational justification of gender identity,

47:31.200 --> 47:33.520
which is another reason I'm not a transmedicalist.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.320
Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory

47:36.320 --> 47:38.160
about why trans identity is valid,

47:38.160 --> 47:40.160
and I don't think it succeeds as that.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.600
I don't think anything does.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.920
My current opinion about this is that

47:43.920 --> 47:46.560
I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

47:46.560 --> 47:50.080
is as good, or rather as bad, an argument as any.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.920
You know, some things in life

47:51.920 --> 47:54.240
just can't be rationally explained.

47:54.240 --> 47:54.800
Like love.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.120
Why do you love the person you love?

47:57.840 --> 47:59.280
Well, because you love them.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.560
You could write a poem about it

48:00.560 --> 48:02.320
or some gay shit like that,

48:02.320 --> 48:04.560
but you can't give any actual arguments.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.840
And why am I a woman?

48:07.280 --> 48:08.160
Because I'm a woman.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.440
That's it.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.360
I mean, I can describe my experiences

48:11.360 --> 48:13.840
and my feelings to you to help you understand better,

48:14.320 --> 48:16.720
but I can't logically prove anything.

48:16.720 --> 48:19.760
And I'm super fucking sorry if you can't handle

48:19.760 --> 48:22.640
that mankind was set adrift in an absurd world.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.960
That must be super fucking hard for you.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.080
Tell me all about it.

48:26.720 --> 48:27.840
Next please.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.880
Okay, again we're mid-thread with missing context,

48:30.880 --> 48:32.000
but the tweet says,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.640
whereas I've met 20-year-olds in full-on boy mode

48:34.640 --> 48:35.200
who are like,

48:35.200 --> 48:36.640
hi, I'm a trans woman.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.080
She, her pronouns.

48:38.080 --> 48:40.640
So, I guess by including this tweet

48:40.640 --> 48:43.680
in the ContraPoints is Problematic collage,

48:43.680 --> 48:46.880
people are implying that I don't think it's valid

48:46.880 --> 48:49.600
for someone who presents male to identify as a woman

48:49.600 --> 48:51.280
and request she, her pronouns.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.800
Well, that's not true.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.880
I was surprised when I first experienced this,

48:54.880 --> 48:56.400
but I think it's valid.

48:56.400 --> 48:56.900
Next.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.320
Okay, mid-thread, no context once again,

49:00.320 --> 49:03.360
but now you go into these leftist Discord slash Facebook groups

49:03.360 --> 49:06.800
and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.520
Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.040
That seems to be the future.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.960
Okay, well, it's true that many leftist Discord servers

49:14.960 --> 49:15.920
are like this,

49:15.920 --> 49:17.040
but reading this back,

49:17.040 --> 49:19.360
I don't like the way the phrase

49:19.360 --> 49:22.400
conventional binary transsexuals is hitting my ear.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.360
I can see how it could imply that non-binary identities

49:25.360 --> 49:28.240
are somehow newfangled, which isn't true.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.160
There's been non-binary people for longer

49:30.160 --> 49:32.880
than there's been medical transsexuals, in fact,

49:32.880 --> 49:35.200
so we'll call this a bad tweet.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.040
I apologize for tweeting it,

49:37.040 --> 49:39.680
and I apologize to any non-binary people

49:39.680 --> 49:41.200
who felt trivialized by it.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.000
Okay, this is the big one.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.120
This tweet got its own article in the fucking Guardian.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.120
You know, I really wish people would pay less attention

49:49.120 --> 49:51.360
to the tweets I spend 30 seconds writing

49:51.360 --> 49:53.120
and a little more attention to the videos

49:53.120 --> 49:56.160
that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.320
Anyway, let's look at the tweet.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.200
This is the most scrutinized paragraph I've ever written,

50:01.200 --> 50:03.280
and it's so mediocre.

50:03.280 --> 50:06.080
This has happened to me before in hyper-woke spaces,

50:06.080 --> 50:07.840
like it's me and a bunch of cis women,

50:07.840 --> 50:10.320
and we all have to go in a circle saying she, her,

50:10.320 --> 50:11.360
because I'm there.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.600
There's this paradox where I can go to a sports bar

50:13.600 --> 50:15.920
in North Carolina and be Miss Mammed all night,

50:15.920 --> 50:19.440
no question, but in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,

50:19.440 --> 50:20.960
I have to explain my pronouns

50:20.960 --> 50:23.520
and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves

50:23.520 --> 50:25.360
every time they say you guys.

50:25.360 --> 50:27.600
I guess it's good for people who use they, them only

50:27.600 --> 50:29.360
and want only gender-neutral language,

50:29.360 --> 50:31.280
but it comes at the minor expense

50:31.280 --> 50:34.000
of semi-passable transes like me,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
and that's super fucking hard for us.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.320
So people interpreted this tweet

50:38.320 --> 50:41.840
as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns,

50:41.840 --> 50:44.720
which I'm literally just not.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.000
Like, I've actually been the person

50:46.000 --> 50:48.960
who initiates the pronoun circle many times.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.840
The backstory of this tweet is basically that

50:51.840 --> 50:54.720
I once got triggered in a situation

50:54.720 --> 50:56.720
where I was with a bunch of cis women

50:56.720 --> 50:59.440
and we all had to go around saying our pronouns,

50:59.440 --> 51:02.160
and like a typical triggered tranny,

51:02.160 --> 51:06.240
I tiptoed over to Twitter to tip-tap type it out.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.400
But here's the thing, by the end of this thread,

51:08.400 --> 51:10.240
I had already talked myself away

51:10.240 --> 51:12.640
from the initial frustration I was expressing.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.640
If you know my videos and my voice,

51:14.640 --> 51:16.000
then you know me saying,

51:16.000 --> 51:20.640
it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable transes,

51:20.640 --> 51:25.040
and that's super fucking hard for us is sarcastic.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.200
It's a minor expense.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.080
It's not actually very hard for us, Gorge.

51:30.080 --> 51:30.960
It's fine.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.480
But people on Twitter don't watch my videos

51:34.480 --> 51:36.640
and they don't get sarcasm.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.840
So people flipped out over this.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.920
I was getting dragged,

51:41.920 --> 51:43.840
and I made the poor decision

51:43.840 --> 51:47.040
to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting,

51:47.040 --> 51:49.360
which 100% of the time

51:49.360 --> 51:52.800
is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.840
So me and my dumb brain did another short thread

51:55.840 --> 51:57.520
trying to clarify what I was saying

51:57.520 --> 52:00.160
and defending my right to talk about my own experiences,

52:00.880 --> 52:02.560
that didn't make things any better.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.440
So in a state of anger and frustration,

52:05.440 --> 52:07.520
I tweeted out yet another thread.

52:07.520 --> 52:10.560
And this time I said some truly stupid things,

52:10.560 --> 52:12.800
including the now infamous line,

52:12.800 --> 52:15.200
I sometimes feel like the last

52:15.200 --> 52:17.280
of the old school transsexuals.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.760
I honestly don't know what the fuck

52:19.760 --> 52:21.600
I was even trying to say.

52:21.600 --> 52:25.280
I don't feel like the last of the old school transsexuals.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.280
I don't even know what that means.

52:27.360 --> 52:30.800
I guess I basically meant that offline,

52:30.800 --> 52:33.040
I don't have any radical aspirations.

52:33.040 --> 52:34.880
You know, I want to be inconspicuous.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.080
I want to blend in.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.160
And that's what I meant by old school.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.720
You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.040
You know, it's funny because it is very different

52:43.040 --> 52:44.320
from the way I am online

52:44.320 --> 52:46.960
where I'm totally shameless and open.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.120
I'm like, sexual confession, everybody.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.560
Sexual confession.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.160
I have abnormal urges.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.080
It's 1am.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.640
My neighbors can definitely hear that.

52:56.640 --> 52:58.320
They know I have abnormal urges now.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.440
They already knew that.

53:00.560 --> 53:03.040
But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,

53:03.040 --> 53:04.560
like a total coward.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.120
So, this was a rage thread,

53:07.920 --> 53:09.440
and I apologize for tweeting it.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.040
Let's go back to Bug Angel.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.840
I'm kind of a conscientious objector

53:19.840 --> 53:21.520
to the practice of condemning someone

53:21.520 --> 53:23.440
based on a collage of their worst tweets

53:23.440 --> 53:24.800
taken out of context.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.520
But I definitely do have anxiety about this.

53:27.520 --> 53:29.600
Like, I think I'm doing the right thing

53:29.600 --> 53:31.920
by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,

53:31.920 --> 53:34.720
but I mean, I could be wrong.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.960
What if I am basically sacrificing myself

53:36.960 --> 53:38.000
for the sake of a person

53:38.000 --> 53:40.400
who really is as bad as Twitter says?

53:40.400 --> 53:41.760
Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,

53:41.760 --> 53:43.120
fuck non-binary people,

53:43.120 --> 53:44.720
and then I'll have fucked up.

53:45.840 --> 53:48.240
This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.760
But I do believe that by refusing to participate

53:51.760 --> 53:53.520
in the anti-Buck Angel pile-on,

53:54.080 --> 53:57.680
I am erring on the morally safer side of things.

53:57.680 --> 54:00.160
Because even if he is a little true scummy,

54:00.160 --> 54:02.480
excommunicating him from the trans community

54:02.480 --> 54:05.360
is still probably not the best approach to take.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.080
In my experience,

54:06.080 --> 54:07.600
when people accept binary

54:07.600 --> 54:09.360
but not non-binary trans people,

54:09.920 --> 54:12.320
it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation

54:12.320 --> 54:14.320
to win them over to some level

54:14.320 --> 54:15.840
of non-binary acceptance.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.440
And I'll give you a couple examples.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.360
The first time I was ever canceled,

54:19.360 --> 54:21.600
like totally trashed on Twitter,

54:21.600 --> 54:23.280
was back in 2017,

54:23.600 --> 54:25.440
when I had not yet medically transitioned,

54:25.440 --> 54:28.000
and at the time, I identified as non-binary.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.480
And at VidCon 2017,

54:30.480 --> 54:32.960
I met up with a YouTuber named June,

54:32.960 --> 54:34.240
who had made some videos

54:34.240 --> 54:37.520
where she basically mocked the idea of non-binary people.

54:37.520 --> 54:41.120
And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June

54:41.120 --> 54:42.080
and some other people,

54:42.080 --> 54:43.440
but let's keep them out of it.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.520
And people on Twitter totally dragged me

54:45.520 --> 54:47.200
for being a peak liberal bootlicker

54:47.200 --> 54:49.280
who's best friends with transphobic abusers.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.200
Oh, Christ.

54:51.840 --> 54:52.800
Fucking people, man.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.200
So fucking frustrating.

54:55.200 --> 54:57.840
And you know, I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,

54:57.840 --> 55:00.000
because I don't know what her thought process was,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.800
but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,

55:02.800 --> 55:05.600
and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.520
And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.

55:12.720 --> 55:13.920
Example two.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.200
A couple months later,

55:15.200 --> 55:16.480
I did a live stream

55:16.480 --> 55:19.120
with a conservative trans woman YouTuber named...

55:22.240 --> 55:22.960
What was her name?

55:23.440 --> 55:23.920
Sharon?

55:24.480 --> 55:25.840
Sharon? Was it Sharon?

55:25.840 --> 55:28.080
I guess she's just not a very memorable person.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.920
Anyway, she had made some videos

55:29.920 --> 55:32.400
saying that non-binary identities aren't real,

55:32.400 --> 55:33.680
but I gave her a chance,

55:33.680 --> 55:34.800
and she surprised me

55:34.800 --> 55:36.800
by being super compassionate and thoughtful.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.000
By the end of that stream,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.480
she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.

55:40.480 --> 55:41.680
So again, the point is not

55:41.680 --> 55:43.520
that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.040
If I was a persuasive genius,

55:45.040 --> 55:47.360
maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.440
The point is that sometimes,

55:49.440 --> 55:51.760
people who seem ignorant or hateful

55:51.760 --> 55:54.320
just need to be given a non-judgmental space

55:54.320 --> 55:56.160
to learn and grow and think.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.160
And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots

55:58.160 --> 56:00.080
actually prevents that growth from happening.

56:00.080 --> 56:02.400
And Sharon, despite her, you know,

56:02.400 --> 56:03.920
totally forgettable personality,

56:03.920 --> 56:06.320
turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.

56:06.320 --> 56:06.960
Like later on,

56:06.960 --> 56:09.840
she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,

56:09.840 --> 56:11.440
and I became good friends with her,

56:11.440 --> 56:12.640
and we worked together

56:12.640 --> 56:14.560
on most of the videos I've made this year.

56:14.560 --> 56:16.240
You know, until she ruined my life

56:16.240 --> 56:18.640
by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.080
I guess the moral is

56:20.160 --> 56:22.240
never talk to people you disagree with.

56:22.240 --> 56:24.000
It will only lead to pain.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.360
I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.

56:35.360 --> 56:38.000
Like, I'm crying three times a day.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.160
Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators

56:40.160 --> 56:41.600
in at least three of my holes.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.040
It happens like once a month.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.480
There has to be a full moon.

56:44.480 --> 56:45.840
I honestly only still bother

56:45.840 --> 56:47.920
because it numbs the pain for a few moments.

56:47.920 --> 56:49.040
What I'm trying to say is

56:49.040 --> 56:50.960
I really do believe in conversation,

56:50.960 --> 56:53.360
which means hearing out multiple perspectives.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.280
I don't want my audience to get all their information

56:55.280 --> 56:56.960
about trans people from me,

56:56.960 --> 56:59.360
and I think it's important to listen to criticism.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.760
So I encourage my audience to go watch

57:01.760 --> 57:04.160
some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me

57:04.160 --> 57:05.680
and criticized Buck Angel.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.520
For example, go check out

57:07.520 --> 57:10.480
non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,

57:10.480 --> 57:13.920
and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.560
I think YouTube as a platform

57:16.640 --> 57:20.480
is better at producing criticism rather than canceling,

57:20.480 --> 57:24.080
and I think that's because, at least in the vlog format,

57:24.080 --> 57:26.800
making a video forces you to confront the fact

57:26.800 --> 57:29.760
that you're a human being with a face and a name

57:29.760 --> 57:32.400
who can be held accountable for the things that you say.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.800
But people on Twitter, it's a different story,

57:34.800 --> 57:36.080
and I think it's time we take a look

57:36.080 --> 57:37.840
at what canceling really is.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.600
I've given you enough context now

57:39.600 --> 57:41.840
for you to understand what I'm about to show you,

57:41.840 --> 57:44.160
which is what I saw on my timeline every day

57:44.160 --> 57:45.440
for nearly a month.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.600
All these tweets are from the aftermath

57:47.600 --> 57:50.320
of my uploading opulence two months ago,

57:50.320 --> 57:52.720
when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.400
And someone better hold my hand now,

57:54.400 --> 57:55.440
because this gets ugly.

57:55.440 --> 58:01.440
Hey, if any of you still support Contrapoints

58:01.440 --> 58:03.040
after her bigging up and collaborating

58:03.040 --> 58:06.080
with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,

58:06.080 --> 58:08.160
you're no friend to gender non-conforming,

58:08.160 --> 58:10.560
non-passing, and non-binary trans people.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.280
Fuck her, and fuck her fucking rift.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.760
I am absolutely furious right now.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.200
Weird how I'm 30 and trans

58:17.200 --> 58:18.720
and manage not to be a true scum?

58:18.720 --> 58:20.320
Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.

58:20.320 --> 58:22.240
Or maybe Contrapoints is a conniving,

58:22.240 --> 58:23.920
rat-fucking capo who could do

58:23.920 --> 58:26.320
with a fully-wound backhand to the mouth.

58:26.320 --> 58:27.920
Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,

58:27.920 --> 58:30.160
I just want to say fuck Contrapoints,

58:30.160 --> 58:31.600
her sycophantic stance,

58:31.600 --> 58:34.320
and all her bread-tube chums who close ranks

58:34.320 --> 58:35.680
to protect her after she throws

58:35.680 --> 58:36.960
the rest of the trans community

58:36.960 --> 58:38.480
under the bus for profit.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.400
Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.

58:40.400 --> 58:43.040
Contrapoints videos are now just style over substance,

58:43.040 --> 58:44.320
so that explains why she took

58:44.320 --> 58:46.000
to TERF ideology so well.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.680
Contrapoints working with true scum

58:47.680 --> 58:50.080
now definitively proves that pretty much

58:50.080 --> 58:51.600
everyone defending Contrapoints

58:51.600 --> 58:54.160
just hates enbies and are also true scum.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.920
Legit gonna start unfollowing peeps

58:55.920 --> 58:58.080
that continue to follow Contrapoints at this point.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.720
Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.

59:00.720 --> 59:02.480
I know there are some that were probably

59:02.480 --> 59:04.480
blindsided by this somehow.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.040
So long as you know that Contrapoints is true scum,

59:07.040 --> 59:08.880
you're safe and cool.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.240
Eat shit, Natalie.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.240
For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,

59:12.240 --> 59:13.760
we expected more from you,

59:13.760 --> 59:16.240
but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,

59:16.240 --> 59:17.920
it's hard to consider others.

59:17.920 --> 59:20.160
Contrapoints more like disappoints.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.000
That's a good one.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.920
If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.280
Fuck Buck Angel.

59:25.280 --> 59:26.560
Fuck Contrapoints.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.040
Fuck any real transsexual.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.160
Fuck your grift.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.600
Here's what hashtag Contrapoints stans don't understand.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.600
If Natalie refuses to accept

59:35.600 --> 59:37.280
that she has an apology to make

59:37.280 --> 59:39.040
and continues profiting from it,

59:39.040 --> 59:41.120
it will become our responsibility

59:41.120 --> 59:42.720
to work on deplatforming her

59:42.720 --> 59:45.200
just like every other racist, sexist,

59:45.200 --> 59:46.720
bigoted content creator.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.720
No one has actually suggested or attempted

59:48.720 --> 59:50.000
to actually cancel her,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.160
but the longer this goes on without an apology

59:52.160 --> 59:53.600
and commitment to do better,

59:53.600 --> 59:55.200
the stronger the case becomes

59:55.200 --> 59:57.600
for actively working to deplatform her.

59:57.600 --> 59:58.720
So in other words,

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.720
no one has suggested we cancel her,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.320
but we should cancel her.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.000
Great.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.640
Can everyone finally agree that Contrapoints belongs

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.640
directly inside a garbage can?

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.920
Here I am, sweetie.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.240
Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.520
Angel Buck.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.720
Thanks for letting us all know

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.760
that you had no idea who he even was

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.720
until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.280
Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.000
a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.520
to try and destroy them,

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.480
and supporting him

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.960
because he looks and sounds like a proper man

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.880
isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.320
This is a huge deal.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.120
Contrapoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.080
We have a Hitler comparison.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.040
Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.240
And y'all would be like,

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.200
oh well, she's just a little flawed, you know.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.000
Fuck off.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.240
Can Natalie Wynn stop being a coward

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.760
and commit to being a transmed?

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.560
It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.320
Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.240
who refuses to take accountability.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.680
Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.600
does not support non-binary people.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.640
Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person, my god.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.200
Every cis and non-binary person

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.360
who thought Natalie Wynn wasn't transmed

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.800
now owes me and every non-binary person $50.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.960
Joe Biden has a better position on the validity

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.120
of non-binary gender than Contrapoints.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.320
My opinion is that Contrapoints really sucks a lot

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.440
and I don't like her.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.040
I hate Contrapoints so goddamn much it's unbelievable.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.400
Contrapoints be like,

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.320
excuse me, non-binary people.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.480
This is a very good impression of me.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.840
You're doing very good, sweetie.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.360
You're doing very, very good.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.200
Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer, bootlicker, and true scum.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.480
Any association with him must be seen as hostile

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.320
to the trans community as a whole,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.880
let alone denial of non-binary existence.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.040
That's the line in the sand, folks.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.800
Where do you stand?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.960
And here we fucking are, dude.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.560
Buck fucking Angel on Contrapoints.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.960
Eat my entire ass.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.520
What, what?

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.520
This is Natalie.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.680
Natalie is a trans medicalist.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.680
This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.600
Lindsay is a left-tuber.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.600
Natalie and Lindsay are still friends

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.800
because Natalie and Lindsay are both cowards.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.880
Left-tube is a griv.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.400
Oh, and they made me the man.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.360
The shade.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.960
Issues that arose with being in Contra's new video.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.880
Her video on TERFs make no sense now.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.280
Her video on trans-trenders make no sense now.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.480
You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.160
totally contradicts the videos

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.080
I've spent hundreds of hours making,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.720
do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.920
Apparently not.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.760
Her apology is completely void,

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.480
sends a message that she hates non-binary people,

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.240
she is reckless with her content,

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.000
positives that arose from Buck Angel

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.520
being in Contra's new video.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.240
She has $400,000 this month from Patreon.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.800
400,000.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.960
This number is completely made up.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.440
Like, it is exponentially wrong.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.760
$400,000.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.440
$400,000 a month.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.080
Hot take.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.320
ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.240
Personally, I like to characterize her

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.840
as the Blair White wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.800
Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.920
who still has not apologized for platforming True Scum

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.000
and is actively taking their side.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.560
Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.080
get the hell away from me.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.440
Pee pee poo poo.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.640
I'm ContraPoints and I can't stop being a trans-medicalist

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.320
and shitting myself in public.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.800
Valid criticisms of marginalized people.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.640
Fuck ContraPoints.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.400
Fuck True Scum.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.240
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.000
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.920
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.840
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.120
ContraPoints is a True-

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.360
You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.120
over and over again, it doesn't-

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.880
You know when you repeat the same sentence

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.800
over and over again, it actually doesn't get more persuasive.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.120
In fact, it might get less persuasive

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.840
because true things usually only have to be said once.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.120
If you still support ContraPoints,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.800
unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.200
In conclusion, fuck Natalie Wynn

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.280
and fuck everything she has to say.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.320
Okay, let's get started.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.160
So that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.240
And all of this, let me remind you,

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.200
is over a 10-second voiceover clip

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.520
and a 48-minute video about a completely unrelated topic.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.200
Like, how do you work?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.720
How do you create when a decision so trivial

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.440
can become the main event for weeks of your life?

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.200
And the tweets are just the beginning.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.800
After that, there's the Reddit threads

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.280
and the YouTube comments and the Facebook discourse

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.840
and the Medium posts and the Newsweek article.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.760
Opulence is a video me and Theron spent hundreds of hours

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.440
carefully piecing together.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.960
I think it's my best video.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.000
And to have the response to it completely overwhelmed

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.240
by one minor casting decision

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.640
is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.000
And it's left me with much less energy to create new things.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.120
But here's the thing,

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.360
people on Twitter saying mean things about me

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.160
is not the worst of it, not even close.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.960
Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.720
who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist content

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.960
on a notoriously right-wing platform.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.480
Ah, sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.920
about myself online,

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.720
most of you probably can't even begin to imagine

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.920
how used to it I am.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.560
And the way you psychologically survive in that situation

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.520
is you block the people and platforms who are harassing you

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.040
and you pay it no mind.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.440
But there's some things you can't block.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.840
And a big one is you can't block people

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.160
from going after your friends and colleagues.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.880
And that is exactly what people did to me

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.200
at the height of the Buck Angel incident.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.680
Lindsay Ellis, Ollie from Philosophy Tube,

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.720
and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.200
demanding that they publicly disown me,

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.680
a person they've all been friends with for years, or else.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.400
In response to demands that she apologize,

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.560
Lindsay released a statement where she said,

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.640
I was not involved in opulence.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.080
My name was mentioned in it,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.480
but I did not participate in the production.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.000
Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.640
I have to ask, apologize for what?

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.960
There is only one logical answer.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.480
Apologize for being friends with Natalie.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.560
And here's a response to her statement.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.720
I don't need to consider you my fucking friend

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.280
to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.880
or allow on your platform.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.000
Same with Contra.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.560
It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.120
to fester for the sake of financial gain,

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.560
which is fine, but it makes you a piece of shit.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.560
And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.240
I doubt that you are gonna read this,

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.160
but can you please just tell us your thoughts

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.600
on that whole situation

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.800
so we could at least know that you were on our side?

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.240
We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.400
and cause BreadTube to go into a schism

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.920
as a result of this.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.420
Thank you.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.440
Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.840
Would be a shame if someone cancelled it.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.120
Oh, so fucking sinister.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.080
Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.600
affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding,

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.400
Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.400
had my private life speculated on,

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.160
and my loved ones insulted.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.760
In recognizing the feelings of those

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.480
who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.040
I do not wish to legitimize the great many people

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.480
who use their hurt as a cover

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.120
for unacceptable, toxic, and abusive behavior.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.200
And here's some responses to Oli.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.440
As a non-binary fan of yours,

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.920
I'm disappointed in this non-apology.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.080
Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.000
Ever having associated with me?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.280
Thinks we are going to criticize Oli of PhilosophyTube for

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.400
being a sniveling, hypocritical piece of shit

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.400
refusing to listen to trans people,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.560
actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.960
the trans people he refuses to listen to.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.240
Thanks for the apology.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240
Now stop endorsing ContraPoints.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.280
Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.520
is demanding that cis people publicly condemn

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.320
a trans woman for loosely associating

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.840
with another trans person.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.800
Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.520
Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who is never

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.200
publicly associated with me,

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.560
got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli,

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.080
you know, after he made the post

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.080
discussing being doxxed and threatened.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.200
And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.560
I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list of people

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.080
that have stood by ContraPoints

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.800
as she's continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.400
To which Mia responds,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:51.360
stood by ContraPoints? Jesus Christ.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.120
No matter what I do, people call me out

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.560
and I'm not even related to the video

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.920
and I don't even know Natalie.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.320
The chain of guilt by association is so long and twisted

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.000
I can barely even follow it.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.400
So they're going after Mia, who tweeted a heart at Oli,

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.320
who failed to condemn me for my voiceover casting

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.160
of Buck Angel, who was retweeted by a TERF.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.480
We're only missing a couple degrees of separation

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.960
before every living person on the planet Earth

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.920
is counseled over the Buck Angel situation.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.240
And several colleagues of mine, by the way,

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.760
Lindsay, Harry, Oli,

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.080
they all took a financial hit over this.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.920
They've all lost some Patreon support.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.320
One of Lindsay's former supporters even demanded

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.760
a $38 lifetime refund, saying,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.400
Dear Lindsay, I'm sorry for being pushy,

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.440
but I really am going to be needing a refund.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.640
I gave money to your operation under the pretense

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.120
that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.680
and supporting ContraPoints and blaming us

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.840
for taking issue with that is, in my opinion, amoral.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.040
Please respond.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.280
I hope she sent it to them in pennies.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.920
So look, I'm very grateful to my colleagues

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.920
for sticking by me through all this,

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.360
but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.280
to anyone who associates with me.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.280
I have no collaborators in this video.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.520
I'm working on this totally alone

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.800
because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.280
and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.760
During the height of this most recent canceling,

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.720
a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.960
I cut the shout out to you in my last video

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.000
because I was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.760
who are getting genuinely scary,

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.320
but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.040
regardless of how many people are asking me to.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.280
Jesus Christ.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.400
The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.800
or even associates with me in any way,

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.560
will be labeled a transphobe.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.120
Any binary trans person who associates with me

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.120
will be branded an NB-phobe.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.680
And any non-binary people who associate with me

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.240
will be ostracized from their own community.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.440
So on the internet, I find myself increasingly alone.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.680
I'm isolated by the harassment.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.160
And that is ultimately the point.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.200
To exile me from my community, from any community.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.200
And it's all because I refuse to participate

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.440
in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.000
My experiences have made me so disillusioned

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.160
with the idea that social media call-outs

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.080
can lead to any kind of justice,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.880
that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.000
There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.720
who I could absolutely hashtag me to,

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.800
but I'm never gonna do it,

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800
because I have no faith left

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.680
in the process of call-out vigilante justice.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.480
And I'm not saying I'm totally against me-to-ing people,

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.000
because I think in some cases,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.720
it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.760
But in my case, I feel like I just know too much

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.480
about the dark side of social media shaming

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.800
to ever wanna participate in it again.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.320
You know, I feel like the story would end up

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.240
being taken out of my control,

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.280
warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.440
It would end up just haunting both me

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.280
and the person I'd be accusing,

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.280
which in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.680
So I'm just not willing to take that risk,

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.080
except maybe in some very extreme situation,

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.760
which this just isn't.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.800
It's not worth it.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.520
And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.360
demanding I condemn Buck Angel

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.120
to save myself from cancellation,

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.900
no!

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.800
I'm just not gonna do that.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.800
I'm a conscientious objector.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.040
I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.320
Take me away, boys.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:27.940
Ugh.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:28.760
Ugh.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.620
If there's one thing I can't stand,

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:37.220
it's Breadtube videos.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.060
Part eight and a half.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.940
The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.440
Ugh.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.260
I have done this to YouTube.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.580
And I'm sorry.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.780
So look, cancelling is not criticism.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.940
It is not holding someone accountable.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.420
It is an attack on a human being.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.660
In this video, I use the word canceling

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.420
more or less synonymously

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.100
with what feminist Jo Freeman,

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.860
author of The Bitch Manifesto,

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.380
calls trashing.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.460
And I've linked her essay Trashing,

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.220
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.260
and the description.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.100
It was originally published in Ms. Magazine in 1976,

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.340
but it is a perfect description

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.820
of what goes on on trans Twitter today.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.100
It is not disagreement.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.300
It is not conflict.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.060
It is not opposition.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.140
These are perfectly ordinary phenomena,

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.980
which, when engaged in mutually,

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.660
honestly, and not excessively,

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.500
are necessary to keep an organism

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.660
or organization healthy and active.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.620
Trashing is a particularly vicious

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.300
form of character assassination

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.300
which amounts to psychological rape.

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.500
It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.260
It is occasionally disguised

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:44.260
by the rhetoric of honest conflict

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.700
or covered up by denying

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.780
that any disapproval exists at all.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:50.340
But it is not done to expose disagreements

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.700
or resolve differences.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.740
It is done to disparage and destroy.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.260
Whatever methods are used,

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.060
trashing involves a violation of one's integrity,

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.220
a declaration of one's worthlessness,

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.300
and an impugning of one's motives.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.580
In effect, what is attacked is not one's actions

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.140
or one's ideas, but one's self.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.340
And that's what distinguishes trashing,

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.060
bullying, or abuse from criticism

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.500
or holding accountable.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.380
Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.460
But when people are canceling me,

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.780
they're not bringing up my problematic tweets

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.260
because they want me to revise my beliefs.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:26.980
No.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.780
What they're doing is accumulating evidence

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.820
to support the case they've decided to make

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.340
that I am a horrible person who must be shunned.

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.020
You know, the only sense in which I am,

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.220
as they like to say,

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.660
the new Blaire White,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.500
is that I think I actually have now

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.060
snatched Vanessa's crown

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.460
as the most hated tran on tran Twitter.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.420
Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.700
Feud with me, goddammit.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.380
You can't have a one-sided feud.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.220
I don't want to be one of those trans YouTubers

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.220
that just drags other trans people all day

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.500
and they never respond.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.020
That would be really pathetic.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.500
The new Laci Green, that's the other one.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.580
The newest in a series of women

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.060
you've decided to treat like supervillains.

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.460
Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.180
And supervillain is the right word.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.900
Like, I'm the bad guy, duh.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.580
I'm the enemy.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.820
And what do you do with the enemy?

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.500
Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform, and destroy.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.020
As that one tweet put it,

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.020
that's the line in the sand, folks.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.620
Where do you stand?

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.300
If you adequately demonstrate

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.700
your searing hatred of Natalie Wynn,

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.540
then you're safe and cool.

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.580
But if you don't,

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:37.540
you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.340
And you too are now the enemy.

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.060
Cancel culture trope seven, dualism.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.980
Certain ancient religions teach their followers

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.580
to understand the cosmos

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.820
as a struggle between light and dark,

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.100
good and evil.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.620
And cancel culture does more or less the same thing.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.220
It's binary thinking.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.540
People are either good or they're bad.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.460
And to add to that, essentialism.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:04.260
If a person says or does a bad thing,

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.300
we should interpret that as the mask slipping,

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.500
as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.420
And anyone who wants to remain good

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.460
had better be willing to publicly condemn

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.500
anyone the community has decided is bad.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.580
There really is something dystopian about this.

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.540
You have to be willing to accuse other people

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.300
to prove your own innocence.

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.220
That's the line in the sand, folks.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.660
Where do you stand?

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.500
In the most extreme version of this,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.820
all bad people are equally bad.

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.500
So collaborating with truscum

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.660
means you may as well be truscum.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.820
And of course, being truscum

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.580
is tantamount to being a TERF.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:41.940
And on trans Twitter,

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:46.020
it is a known fact that TERFs are Nazis.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.700
And this implies that Nazis, TERFs, truscum,

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.620
people who associate with truscum,

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.980
people who fail to condemn

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.740
people who associate with truscum,

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.420
people who offer emotional support

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.780
to people who fail to condemn

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.380
people who associate with truscum,

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.580
all of them must be treated the same way.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.300
Deplatform her just like every other racist,

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.860
sexist, bigoted content creator.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.420
A fully wound backhand to the mouth.

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.660
I recently read a book by Sarah Shulman

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.820
called Conflict is Not Abuse,

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.380
Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility,

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.900
and the Duty of Repair.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.420
Basically, Shulman's argument

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.340
is that in various contexts,

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:24.100
from romantic relationships,

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.940
to community infighting,

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.860
to international politics,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.700
the overstatement of harm

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.660
is used as a justification for cruelty

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.340
and for escalating conflict.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.700
So for example,

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.700
and this is my example, not Shulman's,

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.460
TERFs fixate on the exaggerated danger

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.500
that trans women supposedly pose to cis women.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.980
And in very classic overstatement of harm,

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.260
they'll describe everything they don't like as rape.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:53.140
Trans women entering women's spaces is rape.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.660
Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape.

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.500
And then they use that exaggerated harm

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:02.100
as a justification to retaliate against them,

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.340
to dox and harass and shun.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.940
Well, the same kind of logic

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.940
is used to justify abusive behavior

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.780
within the trans community.

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.220
The dualistic thinking,

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.420
the essentialism,

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:13.940
the pseudo-moralism.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.940
All of this allows people on Twitter

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.980
to treat me in an obviously abusive way,

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.500
all the while feeling like they're doing the right thing,

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.900
because they're attacking the enemy.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.180
And I realize that some people will say

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.340
that I'm the one who's overstating harm

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.700
to evade criticism.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.540
Well look, you've seen the tweets,

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.020
the furious demands for me to be exiled,

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:36.260
the doxing and threatening and ordering around

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.220
of my colleagues,

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.620
the attempts to isolate me from my community,

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.140
the attacks not on my actions

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.820
but on who I am as a person.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.300
There's not really anything ambiguous about this,

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.580
it's just abuse.

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.500
But I don't think it feels like abuse

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.340
to the people who are doing it.

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.980
They feel like they're punching up,

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.900
because I'm a celebrity with a platform

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.740
and lots of Twitter followers.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.900
And it's true that I do have more power

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.060
than any of them individually.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.220
But as a collective,

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.060
they have a terrifying power

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.180
that they don't seem to be aware of as individuals.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:11.380
As John Ronson,

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.940
author of a great book on public shaming put it,

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.780
I suppose that when shamings are delivered

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.020
like remotely administered drone strikes,

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.100
nobody needs to think about how ferocious

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.780
our collective power might be.

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.660
The snowflake never needs to feel responsible

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.780
for the avalanche.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.940
And that's how you get these situations

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.700
where you have hundreds of people

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.300
endlessly bashing someone

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.540
who's already been knocked to the ground

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.500
and feeling all the while like they're punching up.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.140
You know, there's actually a kind of power

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.180
and safety in anonymity and obscurity.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.420
And there are many ways that being a public figure

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.580
makes you really vulnerable.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.220
For example, you're more vulnerable to doxing,

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.140
stalking, and harassment

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.900
on a scale that most people probably can't even imagine.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.220
You're vulnerable to having your reputation

01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.060
permanently degraded

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.940
in a way that people who are posting anonymously

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.740
or pseudonymously are pretty much invulnerable to.

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:07.060
And a lot of the people who are attacking me,

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:09.220
they're not pausing to self-reflect.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.060
They're not holding themselves accountable

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.140
for the consequences of their actions.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.020
They're just venting their unfiltered rage.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.700
But in response to these attacks,

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.540
I, as a powerful person with a platform,

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:24.340
I'm not allowed to react like a human being.

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.020
I'm not allowed to get angry.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.620
I'm not allowed to show pain.

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.220
I'm not allowed to get defensive.

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.820
I'm not allowed to lash out.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:34.420
All I'm allowed to do is go totally numb on the inside

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.500
as I try to frantically calculate

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.140
the ideal public relations response

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.860
that pays due deference to the valid concerns

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.940
of these poor, marginalized people,

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.620
all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.060
that's crashing over me.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.740
You know, people on Twitter,

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.020
they don't try to persuade me like I'm a human being.

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.540
They order me around.

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.060
They tell me what to believe.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.140
They demand that I say exactly

01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.540
what they want me to say or else.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.460
It's extremely objectifying.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.140
They don't treat me like a person

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.220
with my own opinions and feelings.

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:11.380
They treat me as this like brand of moral commodity

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.460
to be consumed or denounced.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.220
And this is all terribly ironic

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.140
because of the conflicting demand

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.580
that creators be authentic all the time.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.460
One thing that always frustrates me about these situations

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:27.380
is there's this demand that you apologize instantly,

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:30.660
and there's this perception that a fast apology

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.820
is more sincere than a delayed one.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.060
But in fact, the opposite is true.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.820
It takes longer than a couple hours

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:41.940
to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow,

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.820
seriously reflect on what you may have done

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.020
or said that was wrong.

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.700
That can take days or weeks or months.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.820
I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon,

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.740
and at the beginning of the stream,

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.940
I gave my emotional half-formed reaction

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.420
to the Buck Angel situation.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:06.580
And some traitor on my Patreon transcribed

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.700
that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.860
just to instigate another round of canceling.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.900
You're not allowed a chance to think or feel.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.700
And because supposedly the best thing to do

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.820
from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately,

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.300
canceling produces a lot of insincere bullshit apologies

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:28.180
from people who haven't in fact learned anything.

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:30.420
And I think most people are aware of that.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.860
In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:35.300
is often insincere.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.260
If you're being canceled rather than criticized,

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.380
then the line in the sand has been drawn.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.820
You and all your kin have been declared the enemy.

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.900
Apologize to Twitter.

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.860
At this point, I may as well apologize to 4chan.

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.140
Dear 4chan, I am super fucking sorry

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.860
I called you thin-wristed otaku shitweasels

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.940
who like looking at pictures of little girls.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.860
I have been trying to educate myself

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.300
and learn from my mistakes,

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:04.340
and I now realize that's only 70% of you.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.380
Once you're canceled, you can really do no right.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.260
If you apologize, the apology will be declared

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.580
a manipulative attempt to save face,

01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.380
and in fact it will be used as further evidence

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.420
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.580
If you try to explain or defend yourself,

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.540
I mean first of all,

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.940
you'll almost certainly dig yourself in deeper.

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.420
But even if you're articulate and correct,

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.220
you'll still be seen as unable to take criticism

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.860
and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people.

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.460
And if you just go silent,

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.500
you'll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability,

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.500
even though there's lots of reasons

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.020
why you might go silent.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.500
Maybe you're taking a few days away from social media

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.820
to try to cool down and think clearly,

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:47.620
or maybe you're so overwhelmed by the harassment

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.900
that you've just shut down.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:56.340
Let's do shots.

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.700
Who wants to do a shot with me?

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.060
Do you want to do a shot with me?

01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.860
Let's do a shot.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.340
A tequila shot is my favorite.

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.980
I like the whole salt tequila lime ritual.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.820
It's just very satisfying to me.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.380
It's the end of that bottle.

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.580
Okay, let's get started.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.420
You feel warm right away,

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.460
you know that feeling where it's like,

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:28.100
oh, hey how are you happiness?

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:28.740
Hey how are you?

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.220
Feeling that life is worth living?

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.020
It's a good moment.

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.780
You're like, oh, this is okay.

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.900
This is gonna be okay.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.020
I can get through this.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.060
That's how it starts.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:37.940
To watch out for that.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.180
So look, I really don't like to represent myself as a victim.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:46.020
That's not really a narrative that I identify with.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.660
But for the purposes of communicating

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.180
what effect canceling has,

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:54.740
I feel like I should say something about the pain.

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:57.220
Much of the happiness that you might expect

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.140
to come along with success

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.460
has been taken away from me

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:05.220
by this constant fury that surrounds me.

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.220
Try to think about this rationally.

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.980
I'm a Libra sun, Pisces moon.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.980
Being canceled is hell for me.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.780
You know, I want to be liked by everyone.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.060
And I'm starting to think

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.900
I might be in the wrong career for that.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.180
In a way, leftist Twitter finally accomplished

01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.980
what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:28.180
have been trying and failing to do to me for years.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.940
They've made Twitter into a platform

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.260
so hostile to my existence

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.100
that I've decided to leave it forever.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.180
And they demoralized me to the point

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:38.500
I could barely get out of bed for a month.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.420
And I know that sounds really melodramatic,

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.060
but I'm just trying to be honest with you

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:46.020
about what a melodramatic person I am.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.100
I find I have trouble convincing people

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.460
of the severity of the pain that being canceled causes,

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.180
because I think it's just hard to imagine

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.860
if you haven't been through it yourself.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.740
And I don't know a more succinct way to convey it to you

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:01.860
than by telling you that in the last few years

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.820
I've been harassed by Nazis, I've been harassed by TERFs,

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.940
I've been stalked, I've been doxxed, I've been threatened,

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.540
I've been sexually assaulted.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.460
And the pain of being canceled,

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.420
of being totally trashed by other trans people online

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.620
for years has been more difficult for me to cope with

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.220
than all the rest of it combined.

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.060
Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.780
better than I think I can describe it myself.

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:25.700
I was one of the first in the country,

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.620
perhaps the first in Chicago,

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.700
to have my character, my commitment,

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.980
and my very self attacked in such a way by movement women

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.060
that it left me torn in little pieces

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.180
and unable to function.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.620
It took me years to recover,

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.940
and even today the wounds have not entirely healed.

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.420
This attack is accomplished by making you feel

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.940
that your very existence is inimical to the movement,

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:49.300
and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist.

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.580
These feelings are reinforced

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.740
when you are isolated from your friends.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.620
As they become convinced that their association with you

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.820
is similarly inimical to the movement and to themselves,

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.060
any support of you will taint them.

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.140
Eventually all your colleagues join in

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:06.340
in a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced,

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.300
and you are reduced to a mere parody of your previous self.

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.500
Yeah, that just about sums it up.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.220
Now as it happens, I am going to survive this

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:19.220
because I have very deliberately built a support network

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.500
that will be there for me

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.700
regardless of what online trans communities say.

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.700
And I have very deliberately done that

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:28.740
because early in my transition back in 2017,

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:33.620
I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:35.460
for all kinds of emotional support.

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.060
You know, when you're early in transition,

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:38.980
I mean, it just sucks.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.620
You feel like the whole world is against you.

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.700
And I talked about this a little bit in my last video,

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.580
you know, feeling like a freak show walking down the street.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.460
And even if you're lucky enough to have a supportive family,

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.740
it usually still is gonna take them a while to come around.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.020
At first they don't get it.

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.380
They say things to you like,

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.220
aren't you worried you'll regret this?

01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.540
And they struggle with your name and pronouns,

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.900
which is understandable,

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.180
but at the same time,

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.220
it makes you feel like you're not being seen for who you are.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.540
So you need a kind of second family

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.300
that understands how you're feeling

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.460
and acts happy about your transition

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.820
and validates your gender.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:15.300
And for the first couple months of my transition,

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:19.300
I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.460
Well, that didn't last long because,

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.940
well, I was, what, two months into my transition

01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.860
when first I did an interview

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.620
with the journalist Jessie Single,

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.580
and then I agreed to do a debate with Theron and Vanessa.

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.540
So that's a long story,

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.580
but in short, I associated with a string of people

01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:37.140
that trans Twitter considers the enemy.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.780
And trans Twitter tore me apart over this,

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.460
and it completely broke my heart

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:44.260
because I was really leaning

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.580
on basically emotional support from strangers online,

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.660
which seems really stupid in retrospect.

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:52.100
And after they turned against me,

01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.300
I decided, one,

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:55.700
that I was never going to rely on this group of people again,

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:56.260
and two,

01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.140
that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.100
And in retrospect,

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.860
I think this actually may have been good for me

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.220
in a roundabout way

01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.300
because I was kicked out of the safe space,

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.820
and I dropped that mentality.

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.620
And so basically I was thrown into the deep end of reality

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.220
and forced to sink or swim.

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.620
And I don't know if my transition or my channel

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:14.900
would be where they are today

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:16.900
if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.100
Are we swimming through fire,

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.700
or are we mixing metaphors?

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.580
The point is,

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.940
I'm more armored against canceling

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.300
than I was two years ago.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.260
And the reason why

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.940
is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and security

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.860
and independence from any one community

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.340
so that if one community cancels me,

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.100
I still have somewhere else to go.

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.780
You know, the people who are most vulnerable

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.900
to cancel culture

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:40.580
are not white guy comedians.

01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.780
They're not James Charles.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:42.740
They're not me.

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.340
They are marginalized people

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.180
who feel like they have nowhere else to go

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.940
when they're rejected by their community.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.180
That means struggling trans people

01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.940
with a few hundred Twitter followers.

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.700
It means a lot of sex workers.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:57.380
It means people who totally rely on activist circles

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.380
for emotional and material support.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.380
I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.820
I had survived my youth

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.900
because I had never given anyone or any group

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.100
the right to judge me.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.340
That right I had reserved to myself.

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.420
But the movement seduced me

01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:12.900
by its sweet promise of sisterhood.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.420
It claimed to provide a haven

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.740
from the ravages of a sexist society,

01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.740
a place where one would be understood.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.540
It was my very need for feminism and feminists

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.220
that made me vulnerable.

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.860
I gave the movement the right to judge me

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.060
because I trusted it.

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.060
And when it judged me worthless,

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.740
I accepted that judgment.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.980
There's a really irritating point

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.540
that people on the left like to make that goes,

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:38.020
well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.100
Canceled people usually get a new job

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.300
or keep their platform,

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.860
so I guess it's not really that bad, huh?

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.300
I think people say this

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.980
because they're trying to mitigate

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:48.660
any sense of guilt they might feel

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.100
about how they're treating people,

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.940
because it's a really stupid argument.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.940
There's lots of things that don't end your life

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:55.140
that are still terrible,

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.660
but also there's cases

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.900
where canceling has ended someone's life.

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.900
On December 5th, 2017,

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.060
a porn star named August Ames

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.700
killed herself by hanging in a public park

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.820
after being canceled on Twitter over a homophobic tweet.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.660
On December 3rd, she tweeted,

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:13.140
whichever lady performer is replacing me tomorrow

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.660
for Erotica X News,

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.740
you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.780
just to let you know.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.700
BS is all I can say, shrug.

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.100
Do agents really not care about who they're representing?

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.660
LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:26.340
So I've never worked in porn,

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.980
so I can't really tell you what the norms are

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.340
around women working with men who have done gay porn.

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.060
But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.580
and that seemed to be the consensus

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.260
of other industry people on Twitter.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.780
So Twitter did its thing,

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:42.180
people in August's community called her a homophobe

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:43.220
and lashed out at her.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:44.740
And as always happens,

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.420
plenty of passersby jumped in

01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.580
to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.

01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.620
Over the next few days,

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.620
August tweeted several more times,

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.780
going through the usual stages that you go through

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:54.980
when you're being canceled.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:56.900
First, she defended herself.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.980
She claimed most other women in the industry

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.100
feel the same as her.

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.540
Then she said she's bisexual

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.220
and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.

01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:05.140
Then she said, fine, I guess I'll be fake

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.420
and not have opinions then.

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.500
Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is,

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.780
and she got really defensive

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:12.100
about her right to choose who she has sex with.

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.420
And she lashed out at the people attacking her.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.500
And then in her final tweet,

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.420
she just said, fuck y'all,

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:21.220
and went to the park that night and killed herself.

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.900
This is all so familiar to me.

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.980
I feel like I'm able to relive with her

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.060
each stage of this emotional process.

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:28.180
There's that first moment

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.940
when you realize the outrage is beginning

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:32.580
and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:35.140
And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.220
And then the bargaining, the fear,

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.700
and finally the shame and the despair.

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.820
And here's the thing,

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.180
I totally agree with her critics that her tweet was bad.

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.900
Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.580
but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:54.260
But she was still a person who deserves to live.

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:55.780
And I think there's gotta be a better way

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.460
to deal with these situations

01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.420
than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:01.860
And I know it's never as simple

01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:03.620
as Twitter made her kill herself.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.100
There's always other things going on in the background.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.780
But the point I'm making is,

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.660
canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.060
because marginalized people generally

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:15.460
have more things going on in the background.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.820
Jon Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death,

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.940
and it goes into how she was sexually abused as a child,

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.380
abandoned by her father.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.660
She was living with a boyfriend

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.740
she was kind of emotionally detached from.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:27.780
And a few weeks earlier,

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.060
she'd filmed a scene with a guy

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.300
who was unnecessarily rough and mean

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.660
and who mistreated her.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.660
So she was kind of traumatized by that.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:36.820
And so she was kind of on edge

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.060
and really defensive about who she worked with

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.020
when she was tweeting.

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.460
Then the backlash happened.

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.020
And since she had no other support network,

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:47.220
she probably felt like the only community she had

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.100
turned against her.

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.580
And that's a really painful feeling.

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.700
She must have felt so despised.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.740
Which is how I've felt for the last two months.

01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:00.340
I feel despised and burdensome.

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.380
And I can imagine how a person who feels that way

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.540
could have an impulsive couple hours

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.860
where they think their best option is suicide.

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.220
I mean, I can more than imagine it

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.740
because I've been there myself.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.300
And I'm still here because at those moments,

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.700
I've been with good friends who took care of me.

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.660
And by friends, I do mean Xanax.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.700
But I've also survived

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.540
because there's a lot of people on the internet

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.780
who'd be very entertained if I killed myself

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.820
and I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:29.860
Oh no, bitch.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:33.140
I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.740
I mean, who needs a guardian angel

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:37.060
when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.220
on the fumes of total contempt?

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:40.740
What I'm really trying to say is,

01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:43.700
Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.

01:34:43.700 --> 01:35:06.660
Oh, holy night, the stars are bright.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:14.500
The shining meow, meow, meow, meow,

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:19.780
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.780
To get my lesbian pliers out again.

01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.700
Have a super fucking happy new year, bitch.

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:34.340
How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.180
Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.020
Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.940
All right, I need to take a deep breath

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.060
because let's be honest,

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:43.140
I'm about one crack away from attacking

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.220
my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:48.660
I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.980
and making a suit out of women's skin.

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.340
Just kidding, I would never do that.

01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.620
Though on a bad skin day,

01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.940
I've given it serious consideration.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.780
Oh, I'll be fine.

01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.140
I've gotta sober up anyway

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.700
because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.820
And plastic surgery,

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:05.220
that's about the only thing holding me together

01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:05.940
at this point.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.340
YouTubing, this is a healthy profession.

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:11.460
This is great.

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.660
Anyone want my job?

01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.420
Step right up.

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.020
All you have to do is make informative

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:16.980
and entertaining videos

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.980
about extremely controversial topics

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.540
while of course representing the full range of experiences

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.100
in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.420
and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:27.140
Well, go on.

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.300
I'm waiting to be entertained.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.180
Feed me, mother.

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.220
Oh, don't mind me.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:34.420
I'll just sit back and pour another glass of wine.

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:37.540
Oh, and I will of course be obsessively scrutinizing

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:40.580
every word you say for any hint of moral transgression

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.940
as well as critiquing your look,

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.620
you third-rate cross-dresser.

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:44.900
Zero out of 10.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:46.020
Get off my stage.

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.940
You successfully spilled that everywhere.

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:48.440
That's good.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.700
I do still want to talk about why people cancel

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.060
and the effect that it's having,

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.260
but it looks like there's gonna have to be a part two gorge

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.700
because I have hit my limit.

01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:59.620
So why don't we all cut our losses

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:01.860
and try again in 2020, hmm?

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.220
I realize that people on Twitter

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.060
aren't actually gonna watch this video,

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.740
they're just gonna make fun of the title

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.940
and how long it is,

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.300
which fair enough,

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.380
but they're the ones whose accusations against me

01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.140
are so numerous and convoluted

01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:15.700
it required a feature-length film to respond to.

01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.060
But yeah, they're gonna see the title

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.700
and they're gonna transcribe quotes out of context

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.380
and they're gonna say I'm a fascist,

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.180
I'm a TERF,

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.060
I'm true scum,

01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.180
I'm the new Blaire White,

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.380
I'm the new Lacey Green,

01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.820
I'm a cis bootlicker,

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.340
I'm an enlightened centrist,

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.380
I'm a shitlib,

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:32.740
I'm a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars

01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.580
over the bodies of dead trans women.

01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.500
Mask off, yikes.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.780
This ain't it, chief.

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.500
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.820
Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:43.860
Disappointing.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:45.540
But they're saying all those things already

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.740
so I'm inoculated.

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.460
See their mistake was completely breaking my spirit,

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.620
they should have left a little piece intact.

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:53.380
But it's good, it's good, it's good,

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:57.540
because basically my survival from here on out

01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:01.140
hinges on my ability to not care at all

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.900
what people say about me online.

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:04.260
So.

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.060
Here's to not giving a fuck.

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:16.340
This is almost a Norma Desmond cosplay,

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.860
which is good because I'm not gonna age gracefully

01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:22.740
and it's the best to get into character now.

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:26.580
YouTube stars never die.
