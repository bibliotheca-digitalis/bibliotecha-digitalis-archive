0	19680	Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help!
19680	22560	All right, I'm gonna get pliers. The lesbian solution.
24800	29520	Okay. Let's get started.
39120	43600	I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my
43600	51280	2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands. All right, no one thinks I'm cute.
51280	57120	Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about canceling, also known as cancel culture,
57120	61120	formerly known as called out culture. And I know you kids know all about this,
61120	66080	but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.
66080	71680	So listen up oldies, in the lingo of these young avocado guzzling smartphone addicts
71680	78320	who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent
78320	83120	members of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang,
83120	89520	this use of the word canceling started out on Black Twitter, where a few years ago people,
89520	93840	well mostly women, would tweet cancel R. Kelly and things like that. You know,
93840	98000	it started out as this vigilante strategy for bringing justice and accountability
98000	103040	to powerful people who previously had been immune to any consequences for their actions.
103040	108160	For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually
108160	112720	abusive men in power who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of
112720	117600	canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none, and bring justice
117600	122240	to prominent abusers. It's in a way the 21st century version of the guillotine,
122240	127520	the bringer of justice, the people's avenger. But also like the guillotine, it can become
127520	132160	a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have,
133040	137120	well, a teensy bit of a reign of terror situation on our hands, Gorge.
137120	141520	Now there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.
141520	146080	On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture
146080	149920	is out of control, you can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial
149920	154080	jackals trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive think piece
154080	158880	authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture, it's just that powerful people
158880	162560	are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it so
162560	167120	they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints
167120	172960	is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.
172960	176560	He didn't know I was transgender. Storytime, emotional, not clickbait.
176560	180800	Let's start with an example. The most high profile YouTube canceling of 2019
180800	184240	was the canceling of James Charles. And again, I know you kids remember this, but
185200	190000	I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders. Put the kettle on, Karen.
190000	195760	So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.
195760	201920	Look, there's these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup.
201920	205680	It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.
205680	211520	I certainly can't. It's pretty bomb, it's lit, it's, uh, it's groovy, it's fab, it's far out,
211520	216560	man, it's a gas, I fully dig it. Free love, give peace a chance, Nixon's a fascist.
216560	223680	So back in May of this year, James' colleague and mother figure, fellow YouTube beauty guru
223680	230560	Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40-minute video accusing James of endorsing a different brand
230560	238160	of hair vitamins than the brand that she, wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.
238160	243600	An enthralling plotline, I know. And this was huge, this was covered in the New York Times.
243600	249520	And while Tati was at it, almost as an afterthought to the, uh, hair vitamin dispute,
249520	254560	she also accused James of being a sexual predator.
254560	259040	Now I actually went back and checked Tati's original deleted video,
259040	262800	and she actually never uses the phrase sexual predator.
262800	267360	It's funny, I remember her calling him that, because that became the story on Twitter.
267360	269760	But what she actually said was,
269760	274320	James had tried to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.
274320	279200	Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay, yet again.
279200	284000	Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.
284000	286160	But see, this is what cancel culture does.
286160	291280	It takes one story and transforms it into a significantly different story.
291280	295440	You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read,
295440	302400	Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.
302400	305920	But cancel culture transforms that story into the headline,
305920	310160	James Charles is a sexual predator.
310160	311200	Interesting.
311200	316000	Now I want to make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James Charles.
316000	317760	I'm not a James Charles stan.
317760	320400	I'm a biological female in my 30s.
320400	321680	Close to death I know.
321680	323440	Please leave a comment before I die.
324240	326800	That said, I do think the statement,
326800	329200	James Charles is a sexual predator,
329200	331040	is a stretch to say the least.
331040	334400	At least based on the information I have in December 2019.
334400	337520	So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.
337520	338960	Cancel culture trope one.
338960	342480	And you should be writing this down class, because this will be on the test.
342480	343920	Cancel culture trope one.
343920	345520	Presumption of guilt.
345520	348240	There's a traditional understanding of justice,
348240	351760	according to which, before you condemn or punish a person,
351760	354000	you hear the accuser's side of the story,
354000	356320	and the accused's side of the story.
356320	358480	You allow both sides to present evidence,
358480	362400	and only after everyone involved has had a chance to make their case,
362400	365280	do you pass sentence and punish the convict.
365280	366960	Aw, punish me king.
366960	368720	Drinking this is punishment enough.
368720	370080	Am I uncanceled yet?
370080	370960	Please?
370960	372080	Now in the United States of...
373040	375600	We legally have the presumption of innocence,
375600	378720	but canceling does not abide by the law.
378720	381600	Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice,
381600	384880	and a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.
384880	388400	Now that's basically the point of the progressive slogan,
388400	390160	believe victims.
390160	393280	It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces,
393280	395200	because out in the world at large,
395200	397760	people generally don't believe victims.
397760	400560	But I think it's pretty obvious how believe victims
400640	402880	is a norm that's easy to abuse.
402880	405600	Was Tati really James' victim?
405600	408320	No, she's not some powerless woman
408320	411040	abused by a prominent man in her industry.
411040	412800	She's on top of the industry,
412800	415600	and she wasn't victimized by James at all.
415600	418960	I see this case more as she weaponized cancel culture
418960	420480	against a business rival.
420480	422480	Anyway, before James had even had a chance
422480	424400	to respond to Tati's accusation,
424400	427360	the story had already gone from Tati Westbrook
427360	430800	accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men
430800	433920	to James Charles tried to trick straight men.
433920	436480	And from there, it was generalized into
436480	439200	James Charles is toxic and manipulative,
439200	443200	which brings us to cancel culture trope two, abstraction.
443760	446240	Abstraction replaces the specific,
446240	450000	concrete details of a claim with a more generic statement.
450000	452080	In the transition from Tati Westbrook
452080	455200	accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men
455200	458160	to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,
458160	460080	we've lost not only the sense of this
460080	462160	being an unverified accusation,
462160	465680	but we've also lost all the specific details.
465680	467840	James Charles is toxic and manipulative
467840	470000	is an incredibly vague statement.
470000	472480	It may as well be James Charles is bad.
472480	474800	But even without the presumption of guilt,
474800	477280	if someone tells me James Charles is accused
477280	479440	of toxic and manipulative behavior,
479440	482080	I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.
482080	484800	And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics,
484800	487040	and whatever my imagination comes up with
487040	488720	is likely going to be worse
488720	490800	than whatever he's actually accused of.
490800	494160	Also, the specific accusation that he tried
494160	496720	to trick straight men into thinking they're gay
496720	500240	is self-evidently kind of questionable.
500240	502720	How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?
502720	504000	If you find out, let me know.
504880	507120	It's bad, I'm bad, I'm super bad.
507120	509440	This is not a problem that straight men
509440	510800	usually seem to have.
510800	513520	At the very least, it requires further explanation.
513520	514880	It's the kind of story that sounds
514880	516320	like it has more than one side.
516320	518880	So I'm immediately gonna feel a little bit skeptical
518880	520000	of the accusation.
520000	523440	And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook,
523440	525920	because this accusation is setting off
525920	527840	my homophobia detection alarm.
527840	530400	Leave the gays alone.
530400	532640	But I'm not gonna have an opportunity
532640	534800	to pick up on the potential homophobia
534800	536240	and be skeptical of it,
536240	538160	if all I've heard about the situation
538160	540880	is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.
540880	544320	And I also wanna point out a linguistic shift
544320	545440	that's happening here.
545440	547040	When the claim was James Charles
547040	548400	tried to trick straight men,
548400	551360	the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.
551360	554400	So what we're criticizing here is James's behavior.
554400	557200	We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,
557200	558800	trying to trick straight men.
558800	561200	But once the claim morphs into James Charles
561200	563440	is toxic and manipulative,
563440	566640	the verb in the sentence is is, to be.
566640	569280	So these adjectives are characteristics of James,
569280	571600	and it's now not his actions we're criticizing,
571600	575920	but his personality, his toxicity, his manipulativeness.
575920	579040	This is what I'll call cancel culture trope three,
579040	580080	essentialism.
580080	581520	Essentialism is when we go
581520	583680	from criticizing a person's actions
583680	586160	to criticizing the person themselves.
586160	588400	We're not just saying they did bad things,
588400	590560	we're saying they're a bad person.
590560	592160	And that's what takes us from
592160	594320	James Charles tried to trick straight men
594320	598240	to James Charles is a sexual predator.
598240	600880	So here, we're targeting James himself,
600880	604160	not just his actions, but the type of person he is,
604160	606560	a sexual predator.
606560	609680	And we've also really escalated the accusation,
609680	611200	because I don't know about you guys,
611200	613600	but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,
613600	616480	the image that comes to mind is a rapist
616480	619680	or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss,
619680	621440	not a teenage twink hung up
621440	622880	on wanting to date straight guys.
622880	624400	I mean, not that a person like that
624400	626080	couldn't be a sexual predator,
626080	629600	but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator
629600	632240	is a fair summary of the accusation.
632240	633920	So this seems to me like a pretty nasty
633920	636080	and dishonest twisting of the story,
636080	638640	and it happened instantaneously on Twitter.
638640	640640	It totally dominated the conversation
640640	644000	in a community of millions of people for weeks.
644000	647200	In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers,
647200	649760	and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.
649760	651600	Not that anyone seems to care.
651600	655600	In fact, most people seem to be enjoying his downfall.
655680	657200	He was a teenage millionaire,
657200	659200	a young, beautiful superstar,
659200	661440	easy to envy, easy to resent,
661440	664160	hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.
664160	666560	What was the point of canceling James Charles?
666560	668160	Did we want to teach him a lesson?
668160	670320	Did we want him to learn from his mistakes
670320	671920	and grow as a person?
671920	674160	Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.
674720	676000	Imagine actually caring.
676000	678880	My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer
678880	681200	was not sincerely outraged and hurt
681200	682720	by their sincere belief
682720	685040	that James Charles was a sexual predator.
685040	688160	In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.
688160	691200	This was a controversy manufactured from the top
691200	694720	by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.
694720	696160	I honestly think that most of the
696160	698480	James Charles is a sexual predator crowd
699200	701200	just wanted to bring him down a peg.
701200	702720	Cancel culture trope four,
702720	705600	pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.
705600	707520	If you look at the world we live in,
707520	710240	would you say that people are usually motivated
710240	714000	by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?
714000	716080	No, maybe not.
716080	717680	Let's be real, America.
717680	720880	We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags
720880	724240	constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.
724240	727360	For Tati, calling out James, this was really,
728240	730480	it was about the hair vitamins, right?
730480	734000	I think Sis was super salty that this millionaire kid
734000	735920	who she had supported and helped
735920	738800	had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand
738800	741920	and accusing him of trying to trick straight men
741920	743920	was just a twist of the knife.
743920	746160	But moralism or intellectualism
746160	749040	provide a phony pretext for the call-out.
749040	751200	You can pretend you just want an apology.
751200	753600	You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen
753600	755280	who wants the person to improve.
755280	758000	You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism
758000	759200	when what you're really doing
759200	761600	is attacking a person's career and reputation
761600	764080	out of spite, envy, revenge.
764080	765520	I mean, it could be any motivation.
765520	768000	Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,
768000	769600	spoiled little brat,
769600	773440	and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face,
773440	774880	at least for a few weeks.
774880	776480	It's schadenfreude, right?
776480	778160	This kind of petty sadism.
778160	779920	Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,
779920	782000	but not the most shameful either.
782000	783360	And that's not to say that everyone
783360	785600	canceling James Charles was insincere,
785600	788080	but there's a world of difference
788080	791760	between cancel R. Kelly and cancel James Charles.
791760	793600	And I'm interested to know
793600	796080	how these two things came to look the same.
796080	797600	When James was being canceled,
797600	799680	I remember being kind of transfixed
799680	801920	by the sight of his life and career
801920	804560	falling from the sky, full tailspin,
804560	806560	black smoke spewing out.
806560	808240	And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,
808240	810240	lol, did you see James Charles is canceled?
810240	811680	LOL, LOL, LOL.
811680	813200	But I looked up at James and I said,
814160	817680	oh God, that's gonna be me someday.
817680	819120	Stay strong, sister.
819120	821280	Don't let the bastards get you down.
823920	825280	Let's switch over to White Claw.
825280	825920	These are cute.
825920	827040	These are fun.
827040	828960	A little more of a feminine moment for me.
828960	831920	They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.
832560	833840	I'm not even wearing makeup.
833840	837440	I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.
839760	840960	Keep drinking, people.
840960	842480	We're gonna make it through this together.
842480	844480	So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology
844480	847120	when I was looking into the James Charles canceling,
847120	849200	and I found a bunch of tweets
849200	852000	referencing earlier James Charles scandals.
852000	853680	Y'all forgiving James Charles?
853680	855280	He's still a transphobe.
855280	856720	Y'all are acting like just because
856720	858160	James Charles has receipts,
858160	860480	he's no longer a racist transphobe.
860480	864480	Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,
864480	866400	and a sexual predator.
866400	867520	A white woman.
867520	869920	Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncanceled.
869920	871280	So according to Twitter,
871280	874400	James Charles is not only a sexual predator,
874400	878240	he's also a racist and a transphobe.
878240	879920	That sounds pretty serious.
879920	881600	Let's investigate.
881600	883760	We'll start with the transphobia allocation.
883760	886480	Cockerels of the jury, exhibit A.
886480	887680	So you're not even full gay?
887680	889040	I mean, no, there have been girls in the past
889040	890560	that I've thought were really, really beautiful.
890560	892560	There's also been trans guys in the past, too,
892560	895520	that I was really, really into for a moment in time.
895520	896240	And I oop.
896240	898320	As I say on Twitter, yikes.
898320	899680	This ain't it, chief.
899680	902640	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.
902640	904800	Maybe don't be transphobic.
904800	905920	Disappointing.
905920	908560	So James did fuck up here.
908560	910560	The problem is he's suggesting
910560	914080	that being attracted to trans men makes him less gay,
914080	917200	which implies that trans men aren't really men,
917200	919280	which is at odds with the way trans men
919280	920480	understand themselves.
920480	923280	So this does deserve criticism, no doubt, no doubt.
923280	926960	However, what I see when I look at this clip of James
926960	931040	is not a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.
931040	934640	I see a very young person who's still working
934640	936960	on understanding his own sexuality
936960	939040	and is trying to figure out
939040	941600	where his attraction to trans men fits into that.
941600	944480	And it seems to me that the proportionate response
944480	948720	to that situation is for someone to take James's side
948720	950160	and explain to him,
950160	953600	look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,
953600	955760	and here are some tips on how to avoid
955760	957360	saying that kind of thing in the future.
957360	960960	You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.
960960	963600	Not understanding someone is not the same
963600	965200	as wanting them dead.
965200	967200	Of course, there are committed bigots
967200	969440	who it's just a waste of time to engage with,
969440	972160	but sometimes just talking to someone
972160	975120	with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.
975120	977200	But that's not what cancel culture does.
977200	981520	Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation
981520	984560	to the highest possible level of conflict.
984560	986480	So by abstraction, we get
986480	988640	James Charles made transphobic comments.
988640	990480	And by essentialism, we get
990480	993840	James Charles is a transphobe.
993840	995680	We don't give him a chance to reflect.
995680	998080	We don't give him an opportunity to learn.
998080	1001360	We go straight to branding him a bigot.
1001360	1003280	Nonetheless, that same week,
1003280	1006320	James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,
1006320	1008560	regardless of whatever my intentions were,
1008560	1011600	that came across as me saying I'm not fully gay
1011600	1013440	because I have been with a trans man.
1013440	1016160	And that is absolutely, first of all, not true.
1016160	1018160	Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.
1018160	1020080	But that stereotype and implication
1020080	1022000	is really, really dangerous.
1022000	1024080	And I'm very, very sorry.
1024080	1026320	If you are a trans man, you are a man.
1026400	1028640	If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.
1028640	1030400	You are valid in your identity.
1030960	1032640	Could you ask for a better apology?
1032640	1035120	Like he not only apologizes for what he said,
1035120	1037600	but he also demonstrates a clear understanding
1037600	1039280	of why it was wrong.
1039280	1043200	So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?
1043200	1044240	Of course not.
1044880	1048160	Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.
1048160	1051920	Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,
1051920	1054480	no matter how convincingly written or delivered.
1054480	1058000	And of course, an insincere apology is further proof
1058000	1061360	of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.
1061360	1063360	Now sometimes, a good apology
1063360	1065520	will calm things down for a while.
1065520	1067440	But the next time there's a scandal,
1067440	1070160	the original accusation will be raised again,
1070160	1071920	as if you never apologized.
1071920	1074800	And that's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,
1074800	1079440	when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.
1079440	1082000	And that's to say nothing of this racism
1082000	1083120	I've been hearing about.
1083120	1084480	Here's the receipts.
1084480	1085760	Exhibit B.
1085760	1088800	In February 2017, when James was much less famous
1088800	1090640	than he is now, he tweeted,
1090640	1092560	I can't believe we're going to Africa today.
1092560	1094480	OMG, what if we get Ebola?
1094480	1095360	James, we're fine.
1095360	1097440	We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.
1098000	1102240	Okay, well, that's a little insensitive maybe.
1102240	1104880	It's not really something an influencer should tweet.
1104880	1107840	And fear of disease associated with Africa,
1108720	1112560	I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area
1112560	1114320	as certain racist tropes.
1114320	1117120	But clearly, this was intended as a joke
1117120	1120880	about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?
1120880	1123440	And anyway, he did apologize, saying,
1123440	1126800	as a white cis male, I recognize my privilege
1126800	1129280	and would never want to take that for granted,
1129280	1130560	but I fucked up.
1130560	1132800	I feel awful for posting what I said.
1132800	1135840	I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.
1135840	1137200	And James hasn't made a habit
1137200	1140240	of making jokes like that ever since, so.
1140240	1142720	Is this one tweet from two years ago
1142720	1145280	that he apologized for, on its own,
1145280	1149920	enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist?
1149920	1153040	Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.
1153040	1155520	Abstraction takes us from two years ago,
1155520	1157440	James Charles made a joke that referenced
1157440	1159680	his fear of getting Ebola in Africa
1159680	1162720	to James Charles made a racist joke.
1162720	1167520	And then essentialism takes us to James Charles is a racist.
1167600	1172320	I don't think that's racist.
1175120	1176720	Look, I want to pause to say,
1176720	1180000	I really do believe in social justice,
1180000	1183840	at least as much as trash like me believes in anything.
1183840	1186640	And believe me, I am well aware that jokes,
1186640	1189920	irony and even complaints about cancel culture
1189920	1193600	are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.
1193600	1196720	The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video
1196720	1199680	about how far-right racists use jokes and memes
1199680	1203040	and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage
1203040	1205760	their hateful beliefs and make them more palatable
1205760	1207280	to a wider audience.
1207280	1210560	So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern
1210560	1213280	for anti-racism and anti-transphobia,
1213280	1217360	as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture
1217360	1220160	is often just a conservative red herring
1220160	1222240	used to shut down any and all complaints
1222240	1224080	about racism or transphobia.
1224080	1227840	But I've also become very disillusioned
1227840	1230160	with the way these accusations are thrown around
1230160	1232880	so frivolously on social media.
1232880	1235280	By the way, they're used to escalate conflict
1235280	1237280	instead of promote understanding.
1237280	1240480	And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized
1240480	1243840	to destroy people who have made mistakes
1243840	1246960	but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.
1246960	1249360	Now maybe you're thinking, destroyed?
1249360	1250960	What do you mean destroyed?
1250960	1252720	James is a 20-year-old millionaire
1252720	1254960	on his way to owning his own makeup empire,
1254960	1257760	and you are completely correct.
1257760	1260800	If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,
1260800	1264080	then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.
1264080	1267840	The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters,
1267840	1270720	and they can set you back a few million subscribers
1270720	1273200	and a lot of emotional turmoil,
1273200	1276800	but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.
1276800	1280160	But here's the thing, what if you're not James Charles?
1280160	1281840	What if you're a small creator?
1281920	1284720	What if you can't afford public relations help?
1284720	1287040	What if you belong to a marginalized community,
1287040	1289280	and you rely on that community for support?
1289280	1292240	Well in that case, it's a whole different story.
1294880	1297840	Let's Irish up this coffee.
1302320	1303600	Shaken, not stirred.
1303600	1304720	Spilled it all over my pussy.
1307840	1308640	That's good.
1308640	1310160	Booze and coffee is a good combination.
1310240	1312080	I'm feeling amped right now.
1312080	1313360	I'm feeling hyped.
1313360	1315600	So this is the part in the video where I should admit
1315600	1317760	that I'm not just a casual observer here.
1317760	1319600	At the time of making this video,
1319600	1321840	sweaty, I'm super canceled.
1321840	1322800	You know, I try to make videos
1322800	1324880	that are both informative and entertaining.
1324880	1326560	So in this video, the information is
1326560	1328160	you get to learn about cancel culture,
1328160	1330080	and the entertainment is
1330080	1332160	you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.
1332800	1333840	Let's get started.
1333840	1335520	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
1335520	1336400	Hey, how are you?
1336400	1338080	God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber
1338080	1340480	who would resort to making videos about my own drama,
1340480	1343200	but things have gotten to a point.
1343200	1345600	I feel like I cannot continue this channel
1345600	1346960	until I spill some tea.
1346960	1348560	So let's get started.
1348560	1350960	Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene.
1350960	1352640	I've never talked about this on my channel before,
1352640	1355280	so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,
1355280	1358000	but I am in fact a transgender woman,
1358000	1360160	which may come as a big shock to many of you
1360160	1361920	since I'm 100% real fesh.
1362960	1365680	I get comments all the time from like very solemn people,
1365680	1369840	like, guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.
1369840	1370880	Great work, detective.
1370880	1372000	You cracked the case.
1372000	1373680	You're doing very good, sweetie.
1373680	1375520	Very, very good.
1375520	1379360	But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,
1379360	1381440	I am a prime target for cancellation,
1381440	1384400	and I have been canceled many, many times.
1384400	1385600	And we're gonna talk about some of the things
1385600	1386720	I've been canceled for
1386720	1388560	and some of the things I've been criticized for,
1388560	1390880	and the difference between criticism and canceling,
1390880	1392800	because yes, there is a difference.
1392800	1395200	As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes
1395200	1398400	because despite how I look, I am not a literal goddess,
1398400	1402800	and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.
1403520	1406560	However, where I believe that criticism of me
1406560	1409920	is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize
1409920	1411600	because here at ContraPoints Industries,
1411600	1414080	we are not in the business of serving bullshit.
1414080	1417200	So the reason for my current cancellation is,
1417840	1420960	in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,
1420960	1423760	I cast transsexual porn star Buck Angel
1423760	1425200	in the role of John Waters.
1425200	1426800	And yes, it's a much better story
1426800	1428240	than the hair vitamin debacle,
1428240	1431120	so notify the drama channels, put in a good word for me,
1431120	1433600	because sweetie, I'm not here to make friends.
1433600	1434400	I'm here to win.
1434400	1437200	So basically I'm canceled for collaborating with Buck Angel,
1437200	1439440	and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel
1439440	1441520	is a horrible person.
1441520	1443680	And so my collaboration with Buck Angel
1443680	1447280	is evidence that I too am a horrible person.
1447280	1448960	Cancel culture trope six,
1448960	1451280	the transitive property of cancellation.
1451280	1453440	Cancellation is infectious.
1453520	1455520	If you associate with a canceled person,
1455520	1457600	the cancellation rubs off.
1457600	1459760	It's like gonorrhea, except doxycycline
1459760	1461360	won't save you this time, sweetie.
1461360	1463840	Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,
1463840	1468160	on whether Buck Angel is, in fact, a horrible person.
1468160	1470000	So who is Buck Angel?
1470000	1473200	Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.
1473200	1475120	He grew up in a world where there was not anything
1475120	1477040	like the visibility and access to information
1477040	1478560	about transition we have today,
1478560	1480720	and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system
1480720	1483200	in place for people who wanted to transition.
1483520	1485680	In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient
1485680	1487120	his doctor had ever treated.
1487120	1490160	In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,
1490160	1492720	his gimmick at the time being the man with a pussy.
1492720	1494320	But he also became an activist.
1494320	1496800	He wanted to create more positive trans representation
1496800	1497840	within the porn world,
1497840	1499920	and from there he became a more general educator
1499920	1501440	and advocate for trans people.
1501440	1503360	I first heard about him in the early 2010s
1503360	1505520	when I was doing some Googling
1505520	1508240	about some little gender issues I was having myself,
1508240	1510400	although I ended up deciding to remain a female.
1510400	1512560	And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people
1512560	1513600	I'd ever heard about,
1513600	1515040	and he made an impact on me in part
1515040	1516720	because you take one look at him and you think,
1516720	1519040	honey, that's a man, but he was born a woman.
1520480	1521600	You can do that.
1521600	1524320	So it's not like he inspired me to transition or anything,
1524320	1526240	it's just, it was one of many moments
1526240	1527920	along my whole entire gender journey.
1527920	1530320	So I had positive feelings about Trampot,
1530320	1532320	that's what he calls himself, from back then,
1532320	1533520	and then a few months ago,
1533520	1536640	when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised
1536640	1538960	over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,
1538960	1540320	we'll get to that one later,
1540320	1543200	I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.
1543200	1545840	Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain.
1545840	1547680	It is okay that you lash out at me.
1547680	1548960	You do this because I am you
1548960	1551200	and you are reflecting your self-hate to me.
1551200	1553280	I am strong and will be here for you forever
1553280	1554400	and no matter what.
1554400	1557440	This is my intention as a human being, to help others.
1557440	1558640	Love, Buck Angel.
1558640	1560800	And then the caption, suffering.
1560800	1563360	That is why the trans community lashes out at each other.
1563360	1565280	I am very aware of the hate towards me
1565280	1566640	by some in the community.
1566640	1569200	They hate on me and others because they are hurt.
1569280	1571520	And those were exactly the words I needed to hear
1571520	1572400	at that moment.
1572400	1575200	So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me
1575200	1576480	and he said, I love you.
1576480	1578480	And I was like, senpai noticed me.
1578480	1580240	And so I said, I love you back.
1580240	1582080	Then when I was working on Opulence,
1582080	1585680	I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.
1585680	1588000	And it was my co-director, Theron, who suggested,
1588000	1590320	don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?
1590320	1592240	And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta.
1592240	1593440	Let's see if he wants to do it.
1593440	1596160	And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel
1596160	1598160	as John Waters in the video credits.
1598800	1601040	A trans icon playing a gay icon.
1601040	1604880	In my head, it was just so, well, iconic.
1604880	1606320	So I got in touch with Buck about the line
1606320	1608000	and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.
1608000	1609200	So here it is.
1609200	1612080	The 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.
1612080	1615120	One must remember, there is such a thing
1615120	1618240	as good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1618240	1622000	To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.
1622960	1624400	That's it, children.
1624400	1626000	That's why mommy's canceled.
1626080	1627280	Now, I was aware at the time
1627280	1629200	that trans Twitter hated Buck Angel,
1629200	1631040	but my thinking was, well,
1631040	1633680	trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity
1633680	1635200	and they certainly hate me.
1635200	1637360	So I wasn't gonna let that stop me.
1637360	1639280	Little did I know quite how vicious
1639280	1640560	things were about to get.
1640560	1642480	Now, so far, I've been telling this story
1642480	1643600	from my point of view,
1643600	1646400	but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.
1646400	1648400	So I want to pause and contextualize
1648400	1651280	why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much
1651280	1652640	they're willing to cancel anyone
1652640	1654080	who even associates with him.
1654080	1655200	Basically, it all goes back
1655200	1657200	to this old debate in the trans community
1657200	1658880	known today in Tumblr lingo
1658880	1661440	as truscum versus transtrenders.
1661440	1663120	So truscum are trans people
1663120	1665520	who distinguish between true trans people
1665520	1666720	and fake trans people,
1666720	1669040	who they call trenders or too-cutes.
1669040	1671520	Usually truscum think that what it is to be trans
1671520	1673840	is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,
1673840	1675440	to pursue a medical transition
1675440	1677040	involving hormones and surgery,
1677040	1678640	and to socially re-assimilate
1678640	1680240	into your target binary gender,
1680240	1681440	so male or female.
1681440	1684000	Anyone who's not that, according to truscum,
1684000	1686080	must either be a confused teenager,
1686080	1687600	someone just trying to get attention,
1687600	1689120	someone mistaking their trauma
1689120	1691040	or their fetish for being trans,
1691040	1692640	in a word, a trender.
1692640	1694480	So that's a viz of transness
1694480	1696640	that usually excludes non-binary people
1696640	1697840	as well as people who don't want
1697840	1699920	to medically transition for whatever reason,
1699920	1700720	and for that reason,
1700720	1703680	this view is sometimes also called transmedicalism,
1703680	1705760	truscum obviously being the derogatory term
1705760	1706480	for these people.
1706480	1709680	So truscum are very hated by a lot of trans people
1709680	1710800	because their viewpoint
1710800	1712960	is that not all trans identities are valid,
1712960	1716320	and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be truscum.
1716320	1718080	So the next question to ask is,
1718080	1719360	is this true?
1719360	1722000	Is Buck Angel, in fact, truscum?
1722000	1724640	Now my honest answer to that question is,
1724640	1725440	I don't know.
1725440	1726800	He's certainly said some things
1726800	1728480	that sound like things truscum say,
1728480	1729280	I'll give you that.
1729280	1730560	A point he likes to make a lot
1730560	1733440	is that he's transsexual, not transgender,
1733440	1734880	and the difference between those terms
1734880	1736480	is sometimes defined as,
1736480	1738240	transsexual implies that you want
1738240	1739920	to pursue medical transition,
1739920	1741360	so hormones and surgery,
1741360	1743680	and transgender doesn't imply that.
1743680	1744880	And people associate this
1744880	1747600	I'm transsexual, not transgender thing with truscum
1747600	1750480	because truscum often call themselves transsexuals
1750480	1752640	and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual
1752640	1753920	isn't really trans.
1753920	1755840	And often those people will be very mean
1755840	1757360	to people they call trenders,
1757360	1759520	especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers
1759520	1761520	like Vanessa LeBlanc
1761520	1763520	and Too Cute Smasher 9000.
1763520	1767520	Too Cute Smasher 9000.
1767520	1769040	Roast me back, Calvin, I dare you.
1772240	1775440	But I think it's important to keep in mind
1775440	1777520	that the term truscum is a product
1777520	1779520	of the 2014 Tumblr wars,
1779520	1781200	and trying to apply it to trans people
1781200	1784320	of an older generation can sometimes be misleading.
1784320	1785840	Like when Buck Angel transitioned,
1785840	1788960	the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,
1788960	1790480	and he still identifies that way.
1790480	1792000	So when younger trans people tell him
1792000	1794080	it's wrong to use the word transsexual,
1794080	1796160	he feels like these ungrateful millennials
1796160	1797840	are invalidating his identity,
1797840	1800000	and I do understand where he's coming from with that.
1800000	1802720	But I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people
1802720	1804320	are skeptical about Buck.
1804320	1805520	Like he says again and again,
1805520	1807520	I'm transsexual, not transgender,
1807520	1809520	like don't mix me up with those people.
1809520	1811360	And that eagerness to separate himself
1811360	1812880	from transgender people,
1812880	1814960	it comes across as hostility.
1814960	1816640	Like I don't think he's ever actually said
1816640	1818400	that nonbinary people aren't valid,
1818400	1820960	but I personally don't like that he seems like
1820960	1822880	he wants to distance himself from them.
1822880	1824560	And that's my disagreement with Buck.
1824560	1827200	It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities
1827200	1829200	because I don't really see him doing that.
1829200	1830560	And if he was doing that,
1830560	1831520	I would have seen it,
1831520	1832720	because for the last two months,
1832720	1834000	a lot of people have been doing nothing
1834000	1836400	but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.
1836400	1839040	But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,
1839040	1842000	and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,
1842000	1844800	it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.
1844800	1846960	And I hope he listens to this criticism,
1846960	1848320	because I think it would be cool
1848320	1850000	if he got better about this.
1850000	1852000	Of course, Buck is technically right
1852000	1853680	that there are different kinds of trans people,
1853680	1854880	and I agree it's important
1854880	1856560	that we can make those distinctions
1856560	1858720	and talk about the differences when they're relevant.
1858800	1861120	But I also think that as a community,
1861120	1863680	trans people benefit from unity, not division.
1863680	1864880	Like, if you have an employer
1864880	1866960	who discriminates against trans people,
1866960	1868960	they're not gonna care if you're transsexual,
1868960	1871680	transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming.
1871680	1873840	They're gonna discriminate against you regardless.
1873840	1875520	So we're all in this together,
1875520	1877280	and there's a lot of disagreements among us,
1877280	1879440	and we often don't get along so well.
1879440	1881680	But politically, I think we should work together
1881680	1882720	as much as possible
1882720	1884640	instead of splitting into little factions,
1884640	1887440	because we share most of the same interests.
1887440	1889200	And I think the best way to do that
1889200	1891200	is to build bridges instead of burning them.
1891200	1892960	And that's why I'm willing to work with people
1892960	1895760	like Buck Angel, who I have some disagreements with.
1895760	1897520	It creates a connection, you know?
1897520	1900560	And having that connection can lead to communication
1900560	1901680	and build understanding.
1901680	1903520	Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.
1903520	1905120	I am very lonely.
1906000	1906640	It's not a joke.
1907600	1908080	It's true.
1908080	1909840	Now, I get that some people have views
1909840	1910960	that are so harmful
1910960	1913600	that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.
1913600	1916000	But in any case, I didn't even give Buck a platform
1916000	1917360	to share his opinions.
1917440	1920320	I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.
1920320	1922080	A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,
1922080	1924640	why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?
1924640	1926560	Well, first of all, I don't actually know John,
1926560	1928800	but I just have a feeling he would write me off
1928800	1931280	as some kind of tranny millennial SJW.
1931280	1934880	Like, why is Buck Angel canceled but John Waters isn't?
1934880	1936640	Well, because trans Twitter does not know
1936640	1937840	who John Waters is.
1937840	1939280	And let's try to keep it that way.
1939280	1940880	I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine
1940880	1941840	who knows John,
1941840	1943680	and he told me that he and John
1943680	1946320	have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.
1946320	1948160	So, plot twist.
1949280	1951840	Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me
1951840	1953920	unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum
1953920	1955760	and apologize for ever working with him.
1955760	1957440	But I'm not gonna do that,
1957440	1960240	because I don't think it would be the right thing to do,
1960240	1962640	and doing it just to get myself uncanceled
1962640	1963600	would be cowardly.
1963600	1966080	I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree
1966080	1967520	with Buck's divisive rhetoric
1967520	1969600	about transsexual versus transgender.
1969600	1972160	I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella
1972160	1974480	instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.
1974480	1976080	And I'm happy to hear out the perspective
1976080	1978000	of non-binary people who don't trust him,
1978000	1979760	because I totally get where they're coming from
1979760	1981120	and I think that's valid.
1981120	1984640	But I also respect the decades of good activism
1984640	1986720	Buck Angel has done for trans people,
1986720	1988640	and I am grateful to him for that.
1988640	1989600	And in light of that,
1989600	1991760	I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt
1991760	1993040	about where his heart is,
1993040	1995600	and express my criticism in a more measured way
1995600	1998000	than just attacking who he is as a person.
1998000	2001920	But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,
2001920	2004160	because this is the strategy they've chosen
2004160	2007280	to establish that I am a horrible person.
2007280	2008640	And if the true scum allegation
2008640	2010080	isn't strong enough to prove it,
2010080	2012720	oh, they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on
2012720	2014080	to hold up their conclusion.
2014080	2016800	For example, here's a tweet claiming,
2016800	2019280	Natalie's trying so fucking hard
2019280	2021600	to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did
2021600	2023200	was write a few iffy tweets,
2023200	2026320	and that's just so fucking far from the truth.
2026320	2029360	Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign
2029360	2031360	outing a trans woman against her will,
2031360	2032640	with a specific intent
2032640	2035440	of causing her physical, emotional, and professional harm.
2035440	2036880	The shorter way of saying that
2036880	2038560	is that he wanted to make her suffer,
2038560	2040560	and she very well could have been killed.
2041120	2042080	Yikes.
2042080	2043360	This ain't it, chief.
2043360	2046240	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.
2046240	2048480	Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.
2048480	2049520	Disappointing.
2049520	2051040	It sounds pretty serious.
2051040	2052880	Let's investigate.
2052880	2054480	Here's what I've managed to piece together.
2054480	2055200	Scene one.
2055200	2057520	The year is 2003, Los Angeles,
2057520	2059280	where the movie world, the porn world,
2059280	2060960	and the BDSM scene come together
2060960	2064400	in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal, and transsexualism.
2064400	2065280	La la land.
2065280	2066960	Dramatis Personae.
2066960	2069360	Buck Angel, transsexual porn star.
2069360	2072880	Ilsa Strix, dominatrix, then-wife of Buck Angel.
2072880	2076400	Lana Wachowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix,
2076400	2079040	at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.
2079040	2080960	The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix
2080960	2082880	and Buck Angel's marriage ended
2082880	2085520	after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,
2085520	2087040	who was not yet out as trans.
2087040	2089520	So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,
2089600	2092080	and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,
2092080	2093680	told a series of magazines
2093680	2096000	that this celebrity director Wachowski
2096000	2098720	was a crossdresser who had stolen his wife,
2098720	2101920	which I guess was the information he had at the time.
2101920	2105680	So is that outing a trans woman against her will?
2105680	2107520	Well, in retrospect, it seems like it,
2107520	2108960	though that may not be what he thought
2108960	2110320	he was doing at the time.
2110320	2112240	But to really get to the bottom of this,
2112240	2113440	we have to do some digging.
2113440	2115600	We have to trawl through the dirty details
2115600	2117680	of trans people's personal histories,
2117680	2119280	which I've noticed is one of the internet's
2119280	2120720	favorite activities.
2120720	2122720	So I actually went on eBay,
2122720	2127120	and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991, January 2006,
2127120	2128880	and I'm finally able to reveal
2128880	2133920	that the seller canceled the order.
2133920	2135520	God damn it!
2135520	2137840	But I was finally able to track down
2137840	2139680	and translate a Spanish version
2139680	2140800	of the Rolling Stone article
2140800	2142080	from the Wayback Machine,
2142080	2145600	and I'm finally able to expose the truth.
2145680	2146180	Stop.
2147040	2148880	Freeze exactly where you are.
2148880	2150160	Take a look at yourself
2150160	2151680	and what all of us have been doing
2151680	2152960	for the last 30 seconds.
2152960	2154960	Who does this behavior remind you of?
2154960	2157280	If your answer is social justice advocates
2157280	2158640	fighting for trans equality,
2159200	2160640	you are incorrect.
2160640	2162240	If your answer is creepy stalkers
2162240	2163280	who hate trans people,
2165360	2167680	I am very suspicious of anyone
2167680	2169680	whose online behavior prompts me
2169680	2171920	to dig through articles full of dead names
2171920	2173920	and sordid scandals involving trans people
2173920	2175600	from almost two decades ago.
2175600	2178000	This is very similar to techniques
2178000	2180800	used against trans people by internet fascists.
2180800	2182480	So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone
2182480	2184400	pushing this kind of investigation.
2184400	2185760	How can you tell the difference
2185760	2187520	between a trans anarcho-socialist
2187520	2188880	with an anime avatar
2188880	2190720	and a Nazi pretending to be
2190720	2193280	a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?
2193280	2195200	Well, you can't.
2195200	2197600	Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,
2197600	2199600	whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.
2199600	2201680	So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,
2201680	2203680	or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me
2203680	2206800	and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason
2206800	2208480	they want me to publicly dig up
2208480	2210720	their 17-year-old divorce drama,
2210720	2213600	this is none of my fucking business.
2213600	2215120	And it's none of yours either,
2215120	2217440	so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms
2217440	2218160	where you belong.
2224720	2226080	Let's Irish up this tea.
2230320	2231840	Doesn't work as well with tea.
2232560	2236400	So setting aside any tabloid drama
2236400	2239120	that may have happened during the Bush administration,
2240320	2242400	I'm saying this in the cuntiest way
2242960	2244480	and they deserve it.
2244480	2247840	They fucking deserve the cuntiness.
2247840	2251440	I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.
2251440	2252400	I'm a lady.
2252400	2253120	She's a woman.
2253840	2255520	The main argument against me
2255520	2257200	usually references a collage
2257200	2259360	of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.
2259360	2261520	And this is supposed to be definitive evidence
2261520	2263600	that he is a horrible person
2263600	2266240	and therefore that I am a horrible person
2266240	2267840	for collaborating with him.
2267840	2270080	Well, here's the thing though.
2270080	2272400	A collage of problematic tweets
2272400	2274160	does not define a person.
2274160	2276800	And I'm very used to being defined that way myself
2276800	2278960	so I know how unfair it can be.
2278960	2281440	Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,
2281440	2282480	a lot of people on Twitter
2282480	2284240	were already calling me truscum.
2284240	2286640	That's been going on a year and a half now.
2286640	2288560	And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,
2288560	2289840	a bunch of people respond saying
2289840	2291040	Natalie is truscum,
2291040	2292400	Natalie is a transmedicalist,
2292400	2294240	Natalie hates non-binary people,
2294240	2295520	and you should really think
2295520	2297040	what kind of message you're sending
2297040	2299040	to your trans and non-binary followers
2299040	2300560	by platforming her.
2300560	2302080	And if the person defends me
2302080	2303840	or argues back in any way,
2303840	2304560	they say,
2304560	2306400	I can't believe you're ignoring
2306400	2309120	the valid concerns of marginalized people.
2309120	2310400	You know, they're weaponizing
2310400	2312960	their marginalized status as trans people
2312960	2316320	to isolate and attack another trans person.
2316320	2318400	And sometimes this stuff gets to my head too.
2318400	2319600	I start asking myself,
2319600	2321520	wait, am I a transmedicalist?
2321520	2323520	Do I really believe all these awful things
2323520	2324640	they say I believe?
2324640	2326000	But the answer is,
2326000	2328000	no, I just don't.
2328000	2329600	These things they're saying about me
2329600	2331760	are 100% not true.
2331760	2332320	You know,
2332320	2334560	believe marginalized people is a norm
2334560	2336560	that is encouraged in leftist spaces
2336560	2337840	for good reason,
2337840	2340480	much like believe victims or believe women.
2340480	2342160	And these norms were established
2342160	2344720	to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,
2344720	2347440	which is not to listen to marginalized people
2347440	2349280	or to victims or to women.
2349280	2351280	But any norm can be abused.
2351280	2352880	And the blunt fact of the matter is,
2353520	2356560	sometimes marginalized people are wrong.
2356560	2359120	Sometimes people calling themselves victims
2359120	2362000	are obscuring a more complicated situation.
2362000	2364960	And it's even happened once or twice
2364960	2367120	that a woman has lied.
2367120	2369600	And the accusation that I'm truscum
2369600	2371920	is simply false.
2371920	2372800	I mean, first of all,
2373360	2375680	I don't even think of my own transgenderism
2375680	2376880	as a medical disorder,
2376880	2378240	much less everyone else's.
2378240	2381680	I have of course collaborated with Dr. Spiegel et al,
2381680	2384000	but I will not have my artistry
2384000	2385840	reduced to mere medicine.
2385840	2389360	Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people
2389360	2391120	is just, no.
2391840	2392340	No.
2393040	2393540	Eh.
2394800	2395360	Eh no.
2395360	2396800	My thinking about trans identity
2396800	2399680	has always been informed by non-binary people.
2399680	2401680	I used to identify as non-binary myself
2401680	2403360	before I medically transitioned,
2403360	2406160	and some of the closest people to me in my life today
2406160	2407760	are non-binary trans people,
2407760	2410880	some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.
2411520	2412400	It's complicated.
2412400	2414960	I've also made at least five videos on this channel
2414960	2417680	arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities
2417680	2419520	going back more than three years.
2419520	2422000	So that's five out of around 50 videos,
2422000	2425120	or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,
2425120	2426880	is about non-binary identity.
2426880	2429040	A few months ago I even made a 30-minute video
2429040	2430400	called Trans-Trenders,
2430400	2432240	which uses character dialogue to show
2432240	2434960	what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.
2434960	2437040	But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter
2437040	2439680	saying that I'm true scum who hates non-binary people,
2439680	2442240	and their main piece of evidence for that
2442240	2444560	is a collage of my problematic tweets.
2445200	2446960	So let's take a look at that.
2446960	2448560	Here's the three tweets that I usually see
2448560	2450560	scrapbooked together as definitive proof
2450560	2452480	that I hate non-binary people.
2452480	2455040	This is the first one, from September 2018.
2455040	2457120	Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread
2457120	2459040	so you can't even see what I'm talking about.
2459040	2461600	I'm sure this is not the experience of many enbies.
2461600	2463200	Enbie means non-binary people.
2463200	2464640	I leave it to them to articulate
2464640	2467520	what enbie existence looks like in a binary world.
2467520	2470000	I do not and I cannot speak for them,
2470000	2471280	but surely an account,
2471280	2473360	God, I used to write like such a nerd,
2473360	2476080	but surely an account that begins and ends
2476080	2479040	with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2479040	2480080	is pretty weak.
2480080	2482240	Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread
2482240	2484640	that that tweet has been clipped out of,
2484640	2487280	I was defending myself from accusations
2487280	2489280	that my most recent video at the time,
2489280	2491760	The Aesthetic, was anti-non-binary.
2491760	2494640	In that video, there's a character named Justine
2494640	2495840	who defends a version
2495840	2497680	of the performativity theory of gender.
2497680	2499120	And basically I made this video
2499120	2500960	to express some angst I was feeling
2500960	2503760	about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.
2503760	2507040	This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,
2507040	2509040	and I've already moved on in my thinking.
2509040	2510480	At that time I was very, um,
2511600	2514000	my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times
2514000	2515520	or else I'm not really a woman.
2515520	2517680	My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping
2517680	2519680	with heterosexual men who resemble my father.
2520320	2521760	Mmmmmm.
2521760	2523600	And anyone who knows anything about trans women
2523600	2526000	knows that most of us go through a stage like this
2526000	2529200	at some point, and some YouTubers never get out of it.
2529200	2531680	But personally, these days,
2531680	2533680	it doesn't matter what I wear.
2533680	2537280	It's when I dream their lilies dreams.
2537280	2540000	Oh, dragging the Danish girl.
2540000	2541120	Well, fuck the Danish.
2541120	2542800	I could never abide that sort of person.
2542800	2544240	We all know what I'm talking about.
2544240	2546160	You can tell the whisky is getting to me
2546160	2549200	because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.
2549200	2550480	These things come out, you know.
2551280	2552720	You get honest, you get real
2553440	2555760	when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.
2555760	2557600	Did I just fucking put lipstick
2557600	2559600	outside of the fucking lip liner?
2559600	2561040	This is all Lily's fault.
2561040	2562320	Lily Alba.
2562320	2563520	Fuck her dreams.
2563520	2565520	The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,
2565520	2567760	I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.
2567760	2569360	And people will say that the fact that
2569360	2572640	not every video I make references non-binary people
2572640	2574960	is itself enbyphobic.
2574960	2577600	As I've said, about one in 10 of my videos
2577600	2578800	is about non-binary.
2579760	2582160	But not all of them are.
2582160	2584880	And I feel entitled to make some videos
2584880	2586720	that are just about trans women.
2586720	2589200	But still, some people on Twitter were saying
2589200	2592080	that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.
2592080	2596240	And because she maybe wins the fictional debate
2596240	2599280	in the video, I, Natalie Wynn,
2599280	2601840	am therefore a transmedicalist.
2601840	2603040	Here's the thing, though.
2603040	2605280	The performativity theory of gender,
2605280	2607760	the one that Justine defends in that video,
2607840	2611840	is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism
2611840	2613760	as it is possible to be.
2613760	2616960	Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,
2616960	2618560	it's neurological, it's hormonal,
2618560	2620240	it's diagnosable and treatable.
2620240	2624160	Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,
2624160	2625920	it's expression, it's performance,
2625920	2628080	it's a social phenomenon.
2628080	2628720	Phenomenon.
2628720	2629840	Phenomenon.
2629840	2630400	Phenomenon.
2631680	2632480	Phenomenon.
2632480	2633440	Phenomenon.
2633440	2636320	Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria
2636320	2638560	or to any kind of medical concept at all.
2638560	2642560	So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,
2642560	2645760	performativity is a kind of social constructionism.
2645760	2648480	So these are exact opposite theories of gender.
2648480	2650240	Are you following along, class?
2650240	2650740	I'm not.
2650740	2654160	I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.
2654160	2656560	But some trans people felt invalidated
2656560	2658720	by things Justine says in that video.
2659280	2661760	And transmedicalism is another thing
2661760	2663600	that makes them feel invalidated.
2663600	2666800	So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist
2666800	2669520	and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.
2669520	2673040	And this is literally just bad media comprehension.
2673040	2676720	Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video
2676720	2680240	that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.
2680240	2682320	And so much of the negative response to that video
2682320	2683680	is just pure emotion.
2683680	2686480	I always hear, I don't care what you intended,
2686480	2688640	trans people were hurt by that video.
2688640	2690400	You hurt trans people.
2690400	2691600	But here's the thing,
2691600	2694160	just because you were hurt by content I made
2694160	2696240	doesn't mean that the content is bad
2696240	2698400	or that I'm victimizing you in some way.
2698400	2699760	I'll give you an example.
2699760	2701760	I did a stream a couple years ago
2701760	2704080	with a BDSM and kink activist.
2704080	2705760	We were talking about various kinks
2705760	2710080	and we got to DDLG, which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.
2710080	2714400	Basically when consenting adults roleplay age difference
2714400	2716480	and the power dynamic that comes with that.
2716480	2717680	And me and this kink activist
2717680	2720400	who are just casually discussing what DDLG is,
2720400	2723760	what it isn't, when I noticed someone in the chat
2723760	2725680	was starting to totally freak out.
2725680	2726960	They were typing in all caps,
2726960	2730320	like my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me.
2730320	2732080	Why are you defending my abuser?
2732080	2734400	I can't believe you'd betray me like this.
2734400	2736400	Please stop taking my abuser's side.
2736400	2737760	Please stop, I'm begging you.
2737760	2740560	This was actually really fucking upsetting to me
2740560	2743280	because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.
2743280	2745360	They were having a panic attack
2745360	2748080	because they were having a trauma trigger reaction
2748080	2749360	to this conversation.
2749360	2751840	And I kept telling them to leave the stream
2751840	2754400	and take care of themselves, but they wouldn't do it.
2754400	2757520	So I had to block them and then later get in touch
2757520	2758720	and make sure they were okay.
2759280	2762240	Now, was their pain very real?
2762240	2762880	Yes.
2762880	2765600	Was it triggered by the content I was streaming?
2766240	2766880	Yes.
2766880	2768560	But does that mean I did anything wrong?
2769760	2770480	No.
2770480	2773120	Is it wrong to talk about kink in contexts
2773120	2775280	where it's clear you're going to be talking about kink?
2776080	2776800	No.
2776800	2779120	But when you produce content online
2779120	2780720	that's going to be viewed by thousands
2780720	2782000	or millions of people,
2782000	2783840	there's always some people out there
2783840	2785520	who are going to be hurt by it.
2785520	2788560	So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made
2788560	2789840	is somehow immoral,
2791040	2792880	I think you need more of an argument
2792880	2794800	than just people were hurt.
2794800	2796720	All right, back to the tweet.
2796720	2799200	To this day, people quote tweet the sentence,
2799200	2801040	but surely an account that begins and ends
2801040	2803440	with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2803440	2804320	is pretty weak.
2804320	2806960	And they claim this is evidence that I'm true scum
2807040	2808720	or that I think people have to prove
2808720	2810160	their identities somehow,
2810160	2813200	which is not at all what I was saying in that thread.
2813200	2814880	What I was saying is,
2814880	2817520	if you're trying to persuade a skeptic
2817520	2819520	that trans identity is valid,
2819520	2821280	simply saying I'm not a man
2821280	2822960	because I don't identify as one
2822960	2824480	isn't a very good argument,
2824480	2825840	which it isn't.
2825840	2827840	I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that
2827840	2828880	so far as I'm aware.
2828880	2831760	That said, I do now disagree with the mindset
2831760	2833440	I had when I tweeted this.
2833440	2835920	Back then, I still delusionally believed
2835920	2838080	that it was possible to rationally explain
2838080	2839920	why trans identity is valid,
2839920	2842400	and I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument
2842400	2844320	than this is how I identify,
2844320	2847040	you have to believe me, no further questions.
2847040	2848640	But I no longer believe there can be
2848640	2851200	any rational justification of gender identity,
2851200	2853520	which is another reason I'm not a transmedicalist.
2853520	2856320	Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory
2856320	2858160	about why trans identity is valid,
2858160	2860160	and I don't think it succeeds as that.
2860160	2861600	I don't think anything does.
2861600	2863920	My current opinion about this is that
2863920	2866560	I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2866560	2870080	is as good, or rather as bad, an argument as any.
2870080	2871920	You know, some things in life
2871920	2874240	just can't be rationally explained.
2874240	2874800	Like love.
2875600	2877120	Why do you love the person you love?
2877840	2879280	Well, because you love them.
2879280	2880560	You could write a poem about it
2880560	2882320	or some gay shit like that,
2882320	2884560	but you can't give any actual arguments.
2884560	2885840	And why am I a woman?
2887280	2888160	Because I'm a woman.
2888720	2889440	That's it.
2889440	2891360	I mean, I can describe my experiences
2891360	2893840	and my feelings to you to help you understand better,
2894320	2896720	but I can't logically prove anything.
2896720	2899760	And I'm super fucking sorry if you can't handle
2899760	2902640	that mankind was set adrift in an absurd world.
2902640	2904960	That must be super fucking hard for you.
2904960	2906080	Tell me all about it.
2906720	2907840	Next please.
2907840	2910880	Okay, again we're mid-thread with missing context,
2910880	2912000	but the tweet says,
2912000	2914640	whereas I've met 20-year-olds in full-on boy mode
2914640	2915200	who are like,
2915200	2916640	hi, I'm a trans woman.
2916640	2918080	She, her pronouns.
2918080	2920640	So, I guess by including this tweet
2920640	2923680	in the ContraPoints is Problematic collage,
2923680	2926880	people are implying that I don't think it's valid
2926880	2929600	for someone who presents male to identify as a woman
2929600	2931280	and request she, her pronouns.
2931280	2932800	Well, that's not true.
2932800	2934880	I was surprised when I first experienced this,
2934880	2936400	but I think it's valid.
2936400	2936900	Next.
2937600	2940320	Okay, mid-thread, no context once again,
2940320	2943360	but now you go into these leftist Discord slash Facebook groups
2943360	2946800	and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.
2946800	2949520	Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.
2949520	2951040	That seems to be the future.
2951600	2954960	Okay, well, it's true that many leftist Discord servers
2954960	2955920	are like this,
2955920	2957040	but reading this back,
2957040	2959360	I don't like the way the phrase
2959360	2962400	conventional binary transsexuals is hitting my ear.
2962400	2965360	I can see how it could imply that non-binary identities
2965360	2968240	are somehow newfangled, which isn't true.
2968240	2970160	There's been non-binary people for longer
2970160	2972880	than there's been medical transsexuals, in fact,
2972880	2975200	so we'll call this a bad tweet.
2975200	2977040	I apologize for tweeting it,
2977040	2979680	and I apologize to any non-binary people
2979680	2981200	who felt trivialized by it.
2982800	2984000	Okay, this is the big one.
2984000	2987120	This tweet got its own article in the fucking Guardian.
2987120	2989120	You know, I really wish people would pay less attention
2989120	2991360	to the tweets I spend 30 seconds writing
2991360	2993120	and a little more attention to the videos
2993120	2996160	that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making.
2997040	2998320	Anyway, let's look at the tweet.
2998320	3001200	This is the most scrutinized paragraph I've ever written,
3001200	3003280	and it's so mediocre.
3003280	3006080	This has happened to me before in hyper-woke spaces,
3006080	3007840	like it's me and a bunch of cis women,
3007840	3010320	and we all have to go in a circle saying she, her,
3010320	3011360	because I'm there.
3011360	3013600	There's this paradox where I can go to a sports bar
3013600	3015920	in North Carolina and be Miss Mammed all night,
3015920	3019440	no question, but in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,
3019440	3020960	I have to explain my pronouns
3020960	3023520	and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves
3023520	3025360	every time they say you guys.
3025360	3027600	I guess it's good for people who use they, them only
3027600	3029360	and want only gender-neutral language,
3029360	3031280	but it comes at the minor expense
3031280	3034000	of semi-passable transes like me,
3034000	3036000	and that's super fucking hard for us.
3036560	3038320	So people interpreted this tweet
3038320	3041840	as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns,
3041840	3044720	which I'm literally just not.
3044720	3046000	Like, I've actually been the person
3046000	3048960	who initiates the pronoun circle many times.
3048960	3051840	The backstory of this tweet is basically that
3051840	3054720	I once got triggered in a situation
3054720	3056720	where I was with a bunch of cis women
3056720	3059440	and we all had to go around saying our pronouns,
3059440	3062160	and like a typical triggered tranny,
3062160	3066240	I tiptoed over to Twitter to tip-tap type it out.
3066240	3068400	But here's the thing, by the end of this thread,
3068400	3070240	I had already talked myself away
3070240	3072640	from the initial frustration I was expressing.
3072640	3074640	If you know my videos and my voice,
3074640	3076000	then you know me saying,
3076000	3080640	it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable transes,
3080640	3085040	and that's super fucking hard for us is sarcastic.
3085040	3087200	It's a minor expense.
3087200	3090080	It's not actually very hard for us, Gorge.
3090080	3090960	It's fine.
3091840	3094480	But people on Twitter don't watch my videos
3094480	3096640	and they don't get sarcasm.
3096640	3099840	So people flipped out over this.
3099840	3101920	I was getting dragged,
3101920	3103840	and I made the poor decision
3103840	3107040	to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting,
3107040	3109360	which 100% of the time
3109360	3112800	is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid.
3112800	3115840	So me and my dumb brain did another short thread
3115840	3117520	trying to clarify what I was saying
3117520	3120160	and defending my right to talk about my own experiences,
3120880	3122560	that didn't make things any better.
3122560	3125440	So in a state of anger and frustration,
3125440	3127520	I tweeted out yet another thread.
3127520	3130560	And this time I said some truly stupid things,
3130560	3132800	including the now infamous line,
3132800	3135200	I sometimes feel like the last
3135200	3137280	of the old school transsexuals.
3138240	3139760	I honestly don't know what the fuck
3139760	3141600	I was even trying to say.
3141600	3145280	I don't feel like the last of the old school transsexuals.
3145840	3147280	I don't even know what that means.
3147360	3150800	I guess I basically meant that offline,
3150800	3153040	I don't have any radical aspirations.
3153040	3154880	You know, I want to be inconspicuous.
3154880	3156080	I want to blend in.
3156080	3158160	And that's what I meant by old school.
3158160	3160720	You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.
3160720	3163040	You know, it's funny because it is very different
3163040	3164320	from the way I am online
3164320	3166960	where I'm totally shameless and open.
3166960	3169120	I'm like, sexual confession, everybody.
3169120	3170560	Sexual confession.
3170560	3172160	I have abnormal urges.
3172880	3174080	It's 1am.
3174080	3176640	My neighbors can definitely hear that.
3176640	3178320	They know I have abnormal urges now.
3178320	3179440	They already knew that.
3180560	3183040	But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,
3183040	3184560	like a total coward.
3184560	3187120	So, this was a rage thread,
3187920	3189440	and I apologize for tweeting it.
3195920	3197040	Let's go back to Bug Angel.
3197760	3199840	I'm kind of a conscientious objector
3199840	3201520	to the practice of condemning someone
3201520	3203440	based on a collage of their worst tweets
3203440	3204800	taken out of context.
3204800	3207520	But I definitely do have anxiety about this.
3207520	3209600	Like, I think I'm doing the right thing
3209600	3211920	by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,
3211920	3214720	but I mean, I could be wrong.
3214720	3216960	What if I am basically sacrificing myself
3216960	3218000	for the sake of a person
3218000	3220400	who really is as bad as Twitter says?
3220400	3221760	Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,
3221760	3223120	fuck non-binary people,
3223120	3224720	and then I'll have fucked up.
3225840	3228240	This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.
3228240	3231760	But I do believe that by refusing to participate
3231760	3233520	in the anti-Buck Angel pile-on,
3234080	3237680	I am erring on the morally safer side of things.
3237680	3240160	Because even if he is a little true scummy,
3240160	3242480	excommunicating him from the trans community
3242480	3245360	is still probably not the best approach to take.
3245360	3246080	In my experience,
3246080	3247600	when people accept binary
3247600	3249360	but not non-binary trans people,
3249920	3252320	it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation
3252320	3254320	to win them over to some level
3254320	3255840	of non-binary acceptance.
3255840	3257440	And I'll give you a couple examples.
3257440	3259360	The first time I was ever canceled,
3259360	3261600	like totally trashed on Twitter,
3261600	3263280	was back in 2017,
3263600	3265440	when I had not yet medically transitioned,
3265440	3268000	and at the time, I identified as non-binary.
3268000	3270480	And at VidCon 2017,
3270480	3272960	I met up with a YouTuber named June,
3272960	3274240	who had made some videos
3274240	3277520	where she basically mocked the idea of non-binary people.
3277520	3281120	And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June
3281120	3282080	and some other people,
3282080	3283440	but let's keep them out of it.
3283440	3285520	And people on Twitter totally dragged me
3285520	3287200	for being a peak liberal bootlicker
3287200	3289280	who's best friends with transphobic abusers.
3289920	3291200	Oh, Christ.
3291840	3292800	Fucking people, man.
3293840	3295200	So fucking frustrating.
3295200	3297840	And you know, I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,
3297840	3300000	because I don't know what her thought process was,
3300000	3302800	but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,
3302800	3305600	and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.
3305600	3307520	And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.
3312720	3313920	Example two.
3313920	3315200	A couple months later,
3315200	3316480	I did a live stream
3316480	3319120	with a conservative trans woman YouTuber named...
3322240	3322960	What was her name?
3323440	3323920	Sharon?
3324480	3325840	Sharon? Was it Sharon?
3325840	3328080	I guess she's just not a very memorable person.
3328080	3329920	Anyway, she had made some videos
3329920	3332400	saying that non-binary identities aren't real,
3332400	3333680	but I gave her a chance,
3333680	3334800	and she surprised me
3334800	3336800	by being super compassionate and thoughtful.
3336800	3338000	By the end of that stream,
3338000	3340480	she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.
3340480	3341680	So again, the point is not
3341680	3343520	that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.
3343520	3345040	If I was a persuasive genius,
3345040	3347360	maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.
3347360	3349440	The point is that sometimes,
3349440	3351760	people who seem ignorant or hateful
3351760	3354320	just need to be given a non-judgmental space
3354320	3356160	to learn and grow and think.
3356160	3358160	And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots
3358160	3360080	actually prevents that growth from happening.
3360080	3362400	And Sharon, despite her, you know,
3362400	3363920	totally forgettable personality,
3363920	3366320	turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.
3366320	3366960	Like later on,
3366960	3369840	she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,
3369840	3371440	and I became good friends with her,
3371440	3372640	and we worked together
3372640	3374560	on most of the videos I've made this year.
3374560	3376240	You know, until she ruined my life
3376240	3378640	by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.
3378640	3380080	I guess the moral is
3380160	3382240	never talk to people you disagree with.
3382240	3384000	It will only lead to pain.
3392880	3395360	I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.
3395360	3398000	Like, I'm crying three times a day.
3398000	3400160	Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators
3400160	3401600	in at least three of my holes.
3401600	3403040	It happens like once a month.
3403040	3404480	There has to be a full moon.
3404480	3405840	I honestly only still bother
3405840	3407920	because it numbs the pain for a few moments.
3407920	3409040	What I'm trying to say is
3409040	3410960	I really do believe in conversation,
3410960	3413360	which means hearing out multiple perspectives.
3413360	3415280	I don't want my audience to get all their information
3415280	3416960	about trans people from me,
3416960	3419360	and I think it's important to listen to criticism.
3419360	3421760	So I encourage my audience to go watch
3421760	3424160	some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me
3424160	3425680	and criticized Buck Angel.
3425680	3427520	For example, go check out
3427520	3430480	non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,
3430480	3433920	and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.
3433920	3436560	I think YouTube as a platform
3436640	3440480	is better at producing criticism rather than canceling,
3440480	3444080	and I think that's because, at least in the vlog format,
3444080	3446800	making a video forces you to confront the fact
3446800	3449760	that you're a human being with a face and a name
3449760	3452400	who can be held accountable for the things that you say.
3452400	3454800	But people on Twitter, it's a different story,
3454800	3456080	and I think it's time we take a look
3456080	3457840	at what canceling really is.
3457840	3459600	I've given you enough context now
3459600	3461840	for you to understand what I'm about to show you,
3461840	3464160	which is what I saw on my timeline every day
3464160	3465440	for nearly a month.
3465520	3467600	All these tweets are from the aftermath
3467600	3470320	of my uploading opulence two months ago,
3470320	3472720	when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.
3472720	3474400	And someone better hold my hand now,
3474400	3475440	because this gets ugly.
3475440	3481440	Hey, if any of you still support Contrapoints
3481440	3483040	after her bigging up and collaborating
3483040	3486080	with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,
3486080	3488160	you're no friend to gender non-conforming,
3488160	3490560	non-passing, and non-binary trans people.
3490560	3493280	Fuck her, and fuck her fucking rift.
3493280	3495760	I am absolutely furious right now.
3495760	3497200	Weird how I'm 30 and trans
3497200	3498720	and manage not to be a true scum?
3498720	3500320	Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.
3500320	3502240	Or maybe Contrapoints is a conniving,
3502240	3503920	rat-fucking capo who could do
3503920	3506320	with a fully-wound backhand to the mouth.
3506320	3507920	Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,
3507920	3510160	I just want to say fuck Contrapoints,
3510160	3511600	her sycophantic stance,
3511600	3514320	and all her bread-tube chums who close ranks
3514320	3515680	to protect her after she throws
3515680	3516960	the rest of the trans community
3516960	3518480	under the bus for profit.
3518480	3520400	Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.
3520400	3523040	Contrapoints videos are now just style over substance,
3523040	3524320	so that explains why she took
3524320	3526000	to TERF ideology so well.
3526000	3527680	Contrapoints working with true scum
3527680	3530080	now definitively proves that pretty much
3530080	3531600	everyone defending Contrapoints
3531600	3534160	just hates enbies and are also true scum.
3534160	3535920	Legit gonna start unfollowing peeps
3535920	3538080	that continue to follow Contrapoints at this point.
3538080	3540720	Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.
3540720	3542480	I know there are some that were probably
3542480	3544480	blindsided by this somehow.
3544480	3547040	So long as you know that Contrapoints is true scum,
3547040	3548880	you're safe and cool.
3548880	3550240	Eat shit, Natalie.
3550240	3552240	For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,
3552240	3553760	we expected more from you,
3553760	3556240	but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,
3556240	3557920	it's hard to consider others.
3557920	3560160	Contrapoints more like disappoints.
3561120	3562000	That's a good one.
3562000	3563920	If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.
3563920	3565280	Fuck Buck Angel.
3565280	3566560	Fuck Contrapoints.
3566560	3569040	Fuck any real transsexual.
3569040	3570160	Fuck your grift.
3570160	3573600	Here's what hashtag Contrapoints stans don't understand.
3573600	3575600	If Natalie refuses to accept
3575600	3577280	that she has an apology to make
3577280	3579040	and continues profiting from it,
3579040	3581120	it will become our responsibility
3581120	3582720	to work on deplatforming her
3582720	3585200	just like every other racist, sexist,
3585200	3586720	bigoted content creator.
3586720	3588720	No one has actually suggested or attempted
3588720	3590000	to actually cancel her,
3590000	3592160	but the longer this goes on without an apology
3592160	3593600	and commitment to do better,
3593600	3595200	the stronger the case becomes
3595200	3597600	for actively working to deplatform her.
3597600	3598720	So in other words,
3598720	3600720	no one has suggested we cancel her,
3600720	3602320	but we should cancel her.
3603360	3604000	Great.
3604000	3606640	Can everyone finally agree that Contrapoints belongs
3606640	3608640	directly inside a garbage can?
3608640	3609920	Here I am, sweetie.
3609920	3612240	Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck.
3612240	3613520	Angel Buck.
3613520	3614720	Thanks for letting us all know
3614720	3617760	that you had no idea who he even was
3617760	3620720	until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.
3620720	3623280	Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck,
3623280	3626000	a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person
3626000	3627520	to try and destroy them,
3627520	3628480	and supporting him
3628480	3630960	because he looks and sounds like a proper man
3630960	3634880	isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.
3634880	3636320	This is a huge deal.
3636320	3639120	Contrapoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.
3639520	3642080	We have a Hitler comparison.
3642080	3645040	Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.
3645040	3646240	And y'all would be like,
3646240	3649200	oh well, she's just a little flawed, you know.
3649200	3650000	Fuck off.
3650000	3652240	Can Natalie Wynn stop being a coward
3652240	3653760	and commit to being a transmed?
3653760	3656560	It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.
3656560	3658320	Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat
3658320	3660240	who refuses to take accountability.
3660240	3661680	Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn
3661680	3663600	does not support non-binary people.
3663600	3666640	Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person, my god.
3666640	3669200	Every cis and non-binary person
3669200	3671360	who thought Natalie Wynn wasn't transmed
3671360	3674800	now owes me and every non-binary person $50.
3674800	3676960	Joe Biden has a better position on the validity
3676960	3679120	of non-binary gender than Contrapoints.
3679120	3682320	My opinion is that Contrapoints really sucks a lot
3682320	3683440	and I don't like her.
3683440	3687040	I hate Contrapoints so goddamn much it's unbelievable.
3687040	3688400	Contrapoints be like,
3688400	3690320	excuse me, non-binary people.
3690320	3692480	This is a very good impression of me.
3692480	3693840	You're doing very good, sweetie.
3693840	3695360	You're doing very, very good.
3695360	3699200	Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer, bootlicker, and true scum.
3699200	3702480	Any association with him must be seen as hostile
3702480	3704320	to the trans community as a whole,
3704320	3706880	let alone denial of non-binary existence.
3706880	3709040	That's the line in the sand, folks.
3709040	3710800	Where do you stand?
3710800	3712960	And here we fucking are, dude.
3713520	3716560	Buck fucking Angel on Contrapoints.
3716560	3718960	Eat my entire ass.
3718960	3721520	What, what?
3722160	3723520	This is Natalie.
3723520	3725680	Natalie is a trans medicalist.
3725680	3727680	This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.
3727680	3729600	Lindsay is a left-tuber.
3729600	3731600	Natalie and Lindsay are still friends
3731600	3734800	because Natalie and Lindsay are both cowards.
3735360	3736880	Left-tube is a griv.
3736880	3738400	Oh, and they made me the man.
3738400	3739360	The shade.
3739360	3742960	Issues that arose with being in Contra's new video.
3742960	3744880	Her video on TERFs make no sense now.
3744880	3747280	Her video on trans-trenders make no sense now.
3747280	3750480	You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel
3750480	3752160	totally contradicts the videos
3752160	3754080	I've spent hundreds of hours making,
3754080	3756720	do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?
3756720	3757920	Apparently not.
3757920	3759760	Her apology is completely void,
3759760	3762480	sends a message that she hates non-binary people,
3762480	3764240	she is reckless with her content,
3764240	3766000	positives that arose from Buck Angel
3766000	3767520	being in Contra's new video.
3767520	3772240	She has $400,000 this month from Patreon.
3773440	3774800	400,000.
3774800	3776960	This number is completely made up.
3776960	3779440	Like, it is exponentially wrong.
3779440	3781760	$400,000.
3781760	3783440	$400,000 a month.
3783440	3784080	Hot take.
3784080	3786320	ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.
3786320	3788240	Personally, I like to characterize her
3788240	3791840	as the Blair White wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.
3791840	3794800	Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit
3794800	3797920	who still has not apologized for platforming True Scum
3797920	3800000	and is actively taking their side.
3800000	3802560	Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,
3802560	3804080	get the hell away from me.
3804080	3805440	Pee pee poo poo.
3805440	3808640	I'm ContraPoints and I can't stop being a trans-medicalist
3808640	3810320	and shitting myself in public.
3812320	3814800	Valid criticisms of marginalized people.
3815440	3816640	Fuck ContraPoints.
3817200	3818400	Fuck True Scum.
3818400	3820240	ContraPoints is a True Scum.
3820240	3822000	ContraPoints is a True Scum.
3822000	3823920	ContraPoints is a True Scum.
3823920	3825840	ContraPoints is a True Scum.
3825840	3827120	ContraPoints is a True-
3827120	3829360	You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence
3829360	3831120	over and over again, it doesn't-
3831120	3832880	You know when you repeat the same sentence
3832880	3836800	over and over again, it actually doesn't get more persuasive.
3836800	3839120	In fact, it might get less persuasive
3839120	3841840	because true things usually only have to be said once.
3843360	3845120	If you still support ContraPoints,
3845120	3848800	unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again.
3848800	3851200	In conclusion, fuck Natalie Wynn
3851200	3853280	and fuck everything she has to say.
3864000	3866320	Okay, let's get started.
3866320	3870160	So that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.
3870160	3872240	And all of this, let me remind you,
3872240	3875200	is over a 10-second voiceover clip
3875200	3879520	and a 48-minute video about a completely unrelated topic.
3879520	3881200	Like, how do you work?
3881200	3884720	How do you create when a decision so trivial
3884720	3887440	can become the main event for weeks of your life?
3887440	3889200	And the tweets are just the beginning.
3889200	3890800	After that, there's the Reddit threads
3890800	3893280	and the YouTube comments and the Facebook discourse
3893280	3895840	and the Medium posts and the Newsweek article.
3895920	3899760	Opulence is a video me and Theron spent hundreds of hours
3899760	3901440	carefully piecing together.
3901440	3902960	I think it's my best video.
3902960	3906000	And to have the response to it completely overwhelmed
3906000	3908240	by one minor casting decision
3908240	3910640	is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.
3910640	3914000	And it's left me with much less energy to create new things.
3914000	3915120	But here's the thing,
3915120	3917360	people on Twitter saying mean things about me
3917360	3920160	is not the worst of it, not even close.
3920160	3922960	Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman
3922960	3926720	who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist content
3926720	3928960	on a notoriously right-wing platform.
3928960	3932480	Ah, sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things
3932480	3933920	about myself online,
3933920	3936720	most of you probably can't even begin to imagine
3936720	3937920	how used to it I am.
3937920	3940560	And the way you psychologically survive in that situation
3940560	3943520	is you block the people and platforms who are harassing you
3943520	3945040	and you pay it no mind.
3945040	3947440	But there's some things you can't block.
3947440	3949840	And a big one is you can't block people
3949840	3952160	from going after your friends and colleagues.
3952160	3954880	And that is exactly what people did to me
3954880	3957200	at the height of the Buck Angel incident.
3957200	3959680	Lindsay Ellis, Ollie from Philosophy Tube,
3959680	3962720	and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets
3962720	3965200	demanding that they publicly disown me,
3965200	3969680	a person they've all been friends with for years, or else.
3969680	3972400	In response to demands that she apologize,
3972400	3974560	Lindsay released a statement where she said,
3974560	3976640	I was not involved in opulence.
3976640	3978080	My name was mentioned in it,
3978080	3980480	but I did not participate in the production.
3980560	3984000	Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,
3984000	3986640	I have to ask, apologize for what?
3987200	3988960	There is only one logical answer.
3989520	3992480	Apologize for being friends with Natalie.
3992480	3994560	And here's a response to her statement.
3994560	3996720	I don't need to consider you my fucking friend
3996720	3999280	to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit
3999280	4000880	or allow on your platform.
4000880	4002000	Same with Contra.
4002000	4004560	It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas
4004560	4007120	to fester for the sake of financial gain,
4007120	4010560	which is fine, but it makes you a piece of shit.
4010560	4012560	And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.
4012560	4014240	I doubt that you are gonna read this,
4014240	4016160	but can you please just tell us your thoughts
4016160	4017600	on that whole situation
4017600	4020800	so we could at least know that you were on our side?
4021520	4024240	We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all
4024240	4026400	and cause BreadTube to go into a schism
4026400	4027920	as a result of this.
4027920	4028420	Thank you.
4029040	4031440	Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.
4031440	4033840	Would be a shame if someone cancelled it.
4034320	4037120	Oh, so fucking sinister.
4037120	4040080	Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement
4040080	4043600	affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding,
4043600	4046400	Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,
4046400	4048400	had my private life speculated on,
4048400	4050160	and my loved ones insulted.
4050160	4051760	In recognizing the feelings of those
4051760	4054480	who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,
4054480	4057040	I do not wish to legitimize the great many people
4057040	4058480	who use their hurt as a cover
4058480	4061120	for unacceptable, toxic, and abusive behavior.
4061120	4063200	And here's some responses to Oli.
4063280	4065440	As a non-binary fan of yours,
4065440	4067920	I'm disappointed in this non-apology.
4067920	4072080	Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?
4072080	4074000	Ever having associated with me?
4074000	4077280	Thinks we are going to criticize Oli of PhilosophyTube for
4077280	4080400	being a sniveling, hypocritical piece of shit
4080400	4082400	refusing to listen to trans people,
4082400	4084560	actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking
4084560	4086960	the trans people he refuses to listen to.
4086960	4088240	Thanks for the apology.
4088240	4090240	Now stop endorsing ContraPoints.
4090240	4093280	Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing
4093280	4097520	is demanding that cis people publicly condemn
4097520	4100320	a trans woman for loosely associating
4100320	4101840	with another trans person.
4101840	4104800	Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?
4104800	4107520	Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who is never
4107520	4109200	publicly associated with me,
4109200	4112560	got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli,
4112560	4114080	you know, after he made the post
4114080	4116080	discussing being doxxed and threatened.
4116080	4119200	And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.
4119200	4122560	I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list of people
4122560	4124080	that have stood by ContraPoints
4124080	4126800	as she's continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.
4126800	4128400	To which Mia responds,
4128400	4131360	stood by ContraPoints? Jesus Christ.
4131360	4133120	No matter what I do, people call me out
4133120	4134560	and I'm not even related to the video
4134560	4135920	and I don't even know Natalie.
4135920	4140320	The chain of guilt by association is so long and twisted
4140320	4142000	I can barely even follow it.
4142000	4146400	So they're going after Mia, who tweeted a heart at Oli,
4146400	4150320	who failed to condemn me for my voiceover casting
4150320	4154160	of Buck Angel, who was retweeted by a TERF.
4154160	4156480	We're only missing a couple degrees of separation
4156480	4158960	before every living person on the planet Earth
4158960	4161920	is counseled over the Buck Angel situation.
4161920	4164240	And several colleagues of mine, by the way,
4164240	4165760	Lindsay, Harry, Oli,
4165760	4168080	they all took a financial hit over this.
4168080	4169920	They've all lost some Patreon support.
4169920	4172320	One of Lindsay's former supporters even demanded
4172320	4175760	a $38 lifetime refund, saying,
4175840	4178400	Dear Lindsay, I'm sorry for being pushy,
4178400	4181440	but I really am going to be needing a refund.
4181440	4184640	I gave money to your operation under the pretense
4184640	4187120	that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable
4187120	4189680	and supporting ContraPoints and blaming us
4189680	4193840	for taking issue with that is, in my opinion, amoral.
4193840	4195040	Please respond.
4195040	4197280	I hope she sent it to them in pennies.
4197280	4199920	So look, I'm very grateful to my colleagues
4199920	4201920	for sticking by me through all this,
4201920	4205360	but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden
4205360	4207280	to anyone who associates with me.
4207280	4209280	I have no collaborators in this video.
4209280	4211520	I'm working on this totally alone
4211520	4214800	because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,
4214800	4217280	and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.
4217280	4219760	During the height of this most recent canceling,
4219760	4222720	a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,
4222720	4224960	I cut the shout out to you in my last video
4224960	4228000	because I was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors,
4228000	4229760	who are getting genuinely scary,
4229760	4232320	but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,
4232320	4235040	regardless of how many people are asking me to.
4235840	4237280	Jesus Christ.
4237280	4240400	The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,
4240400	4242800	or even associates with me in any way,
4242800	4244560	will be labeled a transphobe.
4244560	4247120	Any binary trans person who associates with me
4247120	4249120	will be branded an NB-phobe.
4249120	4251680	And any non-binary people who associate with me
4251680	4254240	will be ostracized from their own community.
4254240	4257440	So on the internet, I find myself increasingly alone.
4257440	4259680	I'm isolated by the harassment.
4259680	4262160	And that is ultimately the point.
4262240	4265200	To exile me from my community, from any community.
4265200	4267200	And it's all because I refuse to participate
4267200	4269440	in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.
4269440	4272000	My experiences have made me so disillusioned
4272000	4274160	with the idea that social media call-outs
4274160	4276080	can lead to any kind of justice,
4276080	4278880	that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.
4278880	4282000	There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics
4282000	4284720	who I could absolutely hashtag me to,
4284720	4286800	but I'm never gonna do it,
4286800	4288800	because I have no faith left
4288800	4291680	in the process of call-out vigilante justice.
4291680	4294480	And I'm not saying I'm totally against me-to-ing people,
4294480	4296000	because I think in some cases,
4296000	4298720	it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.
4298720	4301760	But in my case, I feel like I just know too much
4301760	4304480	about the dark side of social media shaming
4304480	4306800	to ever wanna participate in it again.
4306800	4308320	You know, I feel like the story would end up
4308320	4310240	being taken out of my control,
4310240	4313280	warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.
4313280	4315440	It would end up just haunting both me
4315440	4317280	and the person I'd be accusing,
4317280	4321280	which in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves.
4321280	4323680	So I'm just not willing to take that risk,
4323680	4326080	except maybe in some very extreme situation,
4326080	4327760	which this just isn't.
4327760	4328800	It's not worth it.
4328800	4331520	And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep
4331520	4333360	demanding I condemn Buck Angel
4333360	4335120	to save myself from cancellation,
4336400	4336900	no!
4337440	4338800	I'm just not gonna do that.
4338800	4340800	I'm a conscientious objector.
4340800	4343040	I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.
4343040	4344320	Take me away, boys.
4347440	4347940	Ugh.
4348260	4348760	Ugh.
4350260	4353620	If there's one thing I can't stand,
4354420	4357220	it's Breadtube videos.
4357220	4359060	Part eight and a half.
4359060	4361940	The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.
4361940	4362440	Ugh.
4362820	4364260	I have done this to YouTube.
4365380	4366580	And I'm sorry.
4366580	4369780	So look, cancelling is not criticism.
4369780	4371940	It is not holding someone accountable.
4371940	4374420	It is an attack on a human being.
4374420	4376660	In this video, I use the word canceling
4376660	4378420	more or less synonymously
4378420	4380100	with what feminist Jo Freeman,
4380100	4381860	author of The Bitch Manifesto,
4381860	4383380	calls trashing.
4383380	4385460	And I've linked her essay Trashing,
4385460	4387220	The Dark Side of Sisterhood,
4387220	4388260	and the description.
4388260	4392100	It was originally published in Ms. Magazine in 1976,
4392100	4394340	but it is a perfect description
4394340	4396820	of what goes on on trans Twitter today.
4396820	4398100	It is not disagreement.
4398100	4399300	It is not conflict.
4399300	4401060	It is not opposition.
4401060	4403140	These are perfectly ordinary phenomena,
4403140	4404980	which, when engaged in mutually,
4404980	4406660	honestly, and not excessively,
4406660	4408500	are necessary to keep an organism
4408500	4410660	or organization healthy and active.
4411300	4413620	Trashing is a particularly vicious
4413620	4415300	form of character assassination
4415300	4417300	which amounts to psychological rape.
4417300	4420500	It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive.
4420500	4422260	It is occasionally disguised
4422260	4424260	by the rhetoric of honest conflict
4424260	4425700	or covered up by denying
4425700	4427780	that any disapproval exists at all.
4427780	4430340	But it is not done to expose disagreements
4430340	4431700	or resolve differences.
4431700	4434740	It is done to disparage and destroy.
4434740	4436260	Whatever methods are used,
4436260	4439060	trashing involves a violation of one's integrity,
4439060	4441220	a declaration of one's worthlessness,
4441220	4443300	and an impugning of one's motives.
4443300	4446580	In effect, what is attacked is not one's actions
4446580	4449140	or one's ideas, but one's self.
4449860	4452340	And that's what distinguishes trashing,
4452340	4455060	bullying, or abuse from criticism
4455060	4456500	or holding accountable.
4456500	4459380	Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.
4459380	4461460	But when people are canceling me,
4461460	4463780	they're not bringing up my problematic tweets
4463780	4466260	because they want me to revise my beliefs.
4466260	4466980	No.
4466980	4469780	What they're doing is accumulating evidence
4469780	4472820	to support the case they've decided to make
4472820	4476340	that I am a horrible person who must be shunned.
4476340	4478020	You know, the only sense in which I am,
4478020	4479220	as they like to say,
4479220	4480660	the new Blaire White,
4480660	4482500	is that I think I actually have now
4483140	4485060	snatched Vanessa's crown
4485060	4487460	as the most hated tran on tran Twitter.
4488740	4490420	Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.
4490420	4491700	Feud with me, goddammit.
4491700	4493380	You can't have a one-sided feud.
4493540	4495220	I don't want to be one of those trans YouTubers
4495220	4497220	that just drags other trans people all day
4497220	4498500	and they never respond.
4498500	4500020	That would be really pathetic.
4500660	4502500	The new Laci Green, that's the other one.
4502500	4504580	The newest in a series of women
4504580	4507060	you've decided to treat like supervillains.
4507060	4509460	Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?
4509460	4512180	And supervillain is the right word.
4512180	4514900	Like, I'm the bad guy, duh.
4514900	4516580	I'm the enemy.
4516580	4518820	And what do you do with the enemy?
4518820	4522500	Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform, and destroy.
4522500	4524020	As that one tweet put it,
4524020	4526020	that's the line in the sand, folks.
4526020	4527620	Where do you stand?
4527620	4529300	If you adequately demonstrate
4529300	4531700	your searing hatred of Natalie Wynn,
4531700	4533540	then you're safe and cool.
4533540	4534580	But if you don't,
4535300	4537540	you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.
4537540	4540340	And you too are now the enemy.
4540340	4543060	Cancel culture trope seven, dualism.
4543780	4546980	Certain ancient religions teach their followers
4546980	4548580	to understand the cosmos
4548580	4550820	as a struggle between light and dark,
4550820	4552100	good and evil.
4552260	4555620	And cancel culture does more or less the same thing.
4555620	4557220	It's binary thinking.
4557220	4559540	People are either good or they're bad.
4559540	4561460	And to add to that, essentialism.
4561460	4564260	If a person says or does a bad thing,
4564260	4567300	we should interpret that as the mask slipping,
4567300	4570500	as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness.
4570500	4572420	And anyone who wants to remain good
4572420	4575460	had better be willing to publicly condemn
4575460	4578500	anyone the community has decided is bad.
4578500	4580580	There really is something dystopian about this.
4580580	4583540	You have to be willing to accuse other people
4583540	4585300	to prove your own innocence.
4585300	4587220	That's the line in the sand, folks.
4587220	4588660	Where do you stand?
4588660	4590500	In the most extreme version of this,
4590500	4592820	all bad people are equally bad.
4592820	4594500	So collaborating with truscum
4594500	4596660	means you may as well be truscum.
4596660	4598820	And of course, being truscum
4598820	4600580	is tantamount to being a TERF.
4600580	4601940	And on trans Twitter,
4601940	4606020	it is a known fact that TERFs are Nazis.
4606020	4609700	And this implies that Nazis, TERFs, truscum,
4609700	4611620	people who associate with truscum,
4611620	4612980	people who fail to condemn
4612980	4614740	people who associate with truscum,
4614740	4616420	people who offer emotional support
4616420	4617780	to people who fail to condemn
4617780	4619380	people who associate with truscum,
4619940	4622580	all of them must be treated the same way.
4622580	4625300	Deplatform her just like every other racist,
4625300	4627860	sexist, bigoted content creator.
4627860	4630420	A fully wound backhand to the mouth.
4630420	4632660	I recently read a book by Sarah Shulman
4632660	4634820	called Conflict is Not Abuse,
4634820	4637380	Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility,
4637380	4638900	and the Duty of Repair.
4638900	4640420	Basically, Shulman's argument
4640420	4642340	is that in various contexts,
4642340	4644100	from romantic relationships,
4644100	4645940	to community infighting,
4645940	4647860	to international politics,
4647860	4649700	the overstatement of harm
4649700	4652660	is used as a justification for cruelty
4652660	4654340	and for escalating conflict.
4654340	4655700	So for example,
4655700	4657700	and this is my example, not Shulman's,
4657700	4661460	TERFs fixate on the exaggerated danger
4661460	4664500	that trans women supposedly pose to cis women.
4664500	4666980	And in very classic overstatement of harm,
4666980	4670260	they'll describe everything they don't like as rape.
4670260	4673140	Trans women entering women's spaces is rape.
4673140	4676660	Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape.
4676660	4678500	And then they use that exaggerated harm
4678500	4682100	as a justification to retaliate against them,
4682100	4684340	to dox and harass and shun.
4684340	4685940	Well, the same kind of logic
4685940	4687940	is used to justify abusive behavior
4687940	4689780	within the trans community.
4689780	4691220	The dualistic thinking,
4691220	4692420	the essentialism,
4692420	4693940	the pseudo-moralism.
4693940	4695940	All of this allows people on Twitter
4695940	4698980	to treat me in an obviously abusive way,
4698980	4702500	all the while feeling like they're doing the right thing,
4702500	4704900	because they're attacking the enemy.
4704900	4706180	And I realize that some people will say
4706180	4708340	that I'm the one who's overstating harm
4708340	4709700	to evade criticism.
4709700	4711540	Well look, you've seen the tweets,
4711540	4714020	the furious demands for me to be exiled,
4714020	4716260	the doxing and threatening and ordering around
4716260	4717220	of my colleagues,
4717220	4719620	the attempts to isolate me from my community,
4719620	4721140	the attacks not on my actions
4721140	4722820	but on who I am as a person.
4722820	4725300	There's not really anything ambiguous about this,
4725300	4726580	it's just abuse.
4726580	4728500	But I don't think it feels like abuse
4728500	4730340	to the people who are doing it.
4730340	4732980	They feel like they're punching up,
4732980	4736900	because I'm a celebrity with a platform
4736900	4738740	and lots of Twitter followers.
4738740	4740900	And it's true that I do have more power
4740900	4743060	than any of them individually.
4743060	4745220	But as a collective,
4745220	4747060	they have a terrifying power
4747060	4750180	that they don't seem to be aware of as individuals.
4750180	4751380	As John Ronson,
4751380	4753940	author of a great book on public shaming put it,
4753940	4755780	I suppose that when shamings are delivered
4755780	4758020	like remotely administered drone strikes,
4758020	4760100	nobody needs to think about how ferocious
4760100	4761780	our collective power might be.
4761780	4764660	The snowflake never needs to feel responsible
4764660	4765780	for the avalanche.
4765780	4767940	And that's how you get these situations
4767940	4769700	where you have hundreds of people
4769700	4771300	endlessly bashing someone
4771300	4773540	who's already been knocked to the ground
4773540	4776500	and feeling all the while like they're punching up.
4776500	4779140	You know, there's actually a kind of power
4779140	4782180	and safety in anonymity and obscurity.
4782180	4784420	And there are many ways that being a public figure
4784980	4786580	makes you really vulnerable.
4786580	4789220	For example, you're more vulnerable to doxing,
4789220	4791140	stalking, and harassment
4791140	4794900	on a scale that most people probably can't even imagine.
4794900	4797220	You're vulnerable to having your reputation
4797220	4799060	permanently degraded
4799060	4801940	in a way that people who are posting anonymously
4801940	4804740	or pseudonymously are pretty much invulnerable to.
4804740	4807060	And a lot of the people who are attacking me,
4807060	4809220	they're not pausing to self-reflect.
4809220	4811060	They're not holding themselves accountable
4811060	4813140	for the consequences of their actions.
4813140	4816020	They're just venting their unfiltered rage.
4816020	4817700	But in response to these attacks,
4818340	4821540	I, as a powerful person with a platform,
4821540	4824340	I'm not allowed to react like a human being.
4824340	4826020	I'm not allowed to get angry.
4826020	4827620	I'm not allowed to show pain.
4827620	4829220	I'm not allowed to get defensive.
4829220	4830820	I'm not allowed to lash out.
4830820	4834420	All I'm allowed to do is go totally numb on the inside
4834420	4836500	as I try to frantically calculate
4836500	4839140	the ideal public relations response
4839140	4841860	that pays due deference to the valid concerns
4841860	4843940	of these poor, marginalized people,
4843940	4847620	all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse
4847620	4849060	that's crashing over me.
4849060	4850740	You know, people on Twitter,
4850740	4854020	they don't try to persuade me like I'm a human being.
4854020	4855540	They order me around.
4855540	4857060	They tell me what to believe.
4857060	4859140	They demand that I say exactly
4859140	4861540	what they want me to say or else.
4861540	4863460	It's extremely objectifying.
4863460	4865140	They don't treat me like a person
4865140	4867220	with my own opinions and feelings.
4867220	4871380	They treat me as this like brand of moral commodity
4871380	4873460	to be consumed or denounced.
4873460	4875220	And this is all terribly ironic
4875220	4877140	because of the conflicting demand
4877140	4880580	that creators be authentic all the time.
4880580	4883460	One thing that always frustrates me about these situations
4883460	4887380	is there's this demand that you apologize instantly,
4887380	4890660	and there's this perception that a fast apology
4890660	4892820	is more sincere than a delayed one.
4892820	4895060	But in fact, the opposite is true.
4895060	4896820	It takes longer than a couple hours
4896900	4901940	to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow,
4902500	4904820	seriously reflect on what you may have done
4904820	4906020	or said that was wrong.
4906020	4909700	That can take days or weeks or months.
4909700	4912820	I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon,
4912820	4914740	and at the beginning of the stream,
4914740	4917940	I gave my emotional half-formed reaction
4917940	4920420	to the Buck Angel situation.
4920420	4926580	And some traitor on my Patreon transcribed
4926580	4929700	that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter
4929700	4931860	just to instigate another round of canceling.
4931860	4934900	You're not allowed a chance to think or feel.
4934900	4937700	And because supposedly the best thing to do
4937700	4940820	from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately,
4940820	4945300	canceling produces a lot of insincere bullshit apologies
4945300	4948180	from people who haven't in fact learned anything.
4948180	4950420	And I think most people are aware of that.
4950420	4953860	In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself
4953860	4955300	is often insincere.
4955300	4958260	If you're being canceled rather than criticized,
4958820	4961380	then the line in the sand has been drawn.
4961380	4964820	You and all your kin have been declared the enemy.
4964820	4966900	Apologize to Twitter.
4966900	4969860	At this point, I may as well apologize to 4chan.
4969860	4973140	Dear 4chan, I am super fucking sorry
4973140	4975860	I called you thin-wristed otaku shitweasels
4975860	4977940	who like looking at pictures of little girls.
4977940	4979860	I have been trying to educate myself
4979860	4981300	and learn from my mistakes,
4981300	4984340	and I now realize that's only 70% of you.
4984660	4987380	Once you're canceled, you can really do no right.
4987380	4990260	If you apologize, the apology will be declared
4990260	4992580	a manipulative attempt to save face,
4992580	4995380	and in fact it will be used as further evidence
4995380	4998420	of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.
4998420	5000580	If you try to explain or defend yourself,
5000580	5001540	I mean first of all,
5001540	5003940	you'll almost certainly dig yourself in deeper.
5003940	5006420	But even if you're articulate and correct,
5006420	5009220	you'll still be seen as unable to take criticism
5009220	5011860	and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people.
5011860	5013460	And if you just go silent,
5013460	5016500	you'll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability,
5016500	5018500	even though there's lots of reasons
5018500	5020020	why you might go silent.
5020020	5022500	Maybe you're taking a few days away from social media
5022500	5024820	to try to cool down and think clearly,
5024820	5027620	or maybe you're so overwhelmed by the harassment
5027620	5028900	that you've just shut down.
5028900	5036340	Let's do shots.
5036340	5037700	Who wants to do a shot with me?
5037700	5039060	Do you want to do a shot with me?
5039060	5039860	Let's do a shot.
5040500	5042340	A tequila shot is my favorite.
5042340	5046980	I like the whole salt tequila lime ritual.
5046980	5048820	It's just very satisfying to me.
5049620	5051380	It's the end of that bottle.
5052580	5054580	Okay, let's get started.
5061140	5062420	You feel warm right away,
5062420	5063460	you know that feeling where it's like,
5065140	5068100	oh, hey how are you happiness?
5068100	5068740	Hey how are you?
5069460	5071220	Feeling that life is worth living?
5071220	5072020	It's a good moment.
5072420	5073780	You're like, oh, this is okay.
5073780	5074900	This is gonna be okay.
5074900	5076020	I can get through this.
5076020	5077060	That's how it starts.
5077060	5077940	To watch out for that.
5077940	5082180	So look, I really don't like to represent myself as a victim.
5082180	5086020	That's not really a narrative that I identify with.
5086020	5088660	But for the purposes of communicating
5088660	5090180	what effect canceling has,
5090820	5094740	I feel like I should say something about the pain.
5094740	5097220	Much of the happiness that you might expect
5097220	5099140	to come along with success
5099140	5101460	has been taken away from me
5101460	5105220	by this constant fury that surrounds me.
5105220	5107220	Try to think about this rationally.
5107220	5108980	I'm a Libra sun, Pisces moon.
5108980	5110980	Being canceled is hell for me.
5110980	5113780	You know, I want to be liked by everyone.
5114500	5117060	And I'm starting to think
5117060	5118900	I might be in the wrong career for that.
5119540	5122180	In a way, leftist Twitter finally accomplished
5122180	5124980	what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs
5124980	5128180	have been trying and failing to do to me for years.
5128180	5129940	They've made Twitter into a platform
5129940	5132260	so hostile to my existence
5132260	5134100	that I've decided to leave it forever.
5134100	5136180	And they demoralized me to the point
5136180	5138500	I could barely get out of bed for a month.
5138500	5140420	And I know that sounds really melodramatic,
5140420	5143060	but I'm just trying to be honest with you
5143060	5146020	about what a melodramatic person I am.
5146020	5148100	I find I have trouble convincing people
5148100	5151460	of the severity of the pain that being canceled causes,
5151460	5154180	because I think it's just hard to imagine
5154180	5155860	if you haven't been through it yourself.
5155860	5158740	And I don't know a more succinct way to convey it to you
5158740	5161860	than by telling you that in the last few years
5161860	5164820	I've been harassed by Nazis, I've been harassed by TERFs,
5164820	5167940	I've been stalked, I've been doxxed, I've been threatened,
5167940	5169540	I've been sexually assaulted.
5169540	5171460	And the pain of being canceled,
5171460	5174420	of being totally trashed by other trans people online
5174420	5177620	for years has been more difficult for me to cope with
5177620	5179220	than all the rest of it combined.
5179220	5181060	Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel
5181700	5183780	better than I think I can describe it myself.
5183860	5185700	I was one of the first in the country,
5185700	5187620	perhaps the first in Chicago,
5187620	5189700	to have my character, my commitment,
5189700	5192980	and my very self attacked in such a way by movement women
5192980	5195060	that it left me torn in little pieces
5195060	5196180	and unable to function.
5196180	5197620	It took me years to recover,
5197620	5199940	and even today the wounds have not entirely healed.
5199940	5202420	This attack is accomplished by making you feel
5202420	5205940	that your very existence is inimical to the movement,
5205940	5209300	and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist.
5209300	5210580	These feelings are reinforced
5210580	5212740	when you are isolated from your friends.
5212740	5215620	As they become convinced that their association with you
5215620	5218820	is similarly inimical to the movement and to themselves,
5218820	5221060	any support of you will taint them.
5221060	5223140	Eventually all your colleagues join in
5223140	5226340	in a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced,
5226340	5229300	and you are reduced to a mere parody of your previous self.
5229940	5232500	Yeah, that just about sums it up.
5232500	5235220	Now as it happens, I am going to survive this
5235220	5239220	because I have very deliberately built a support network
5239220	5240500	that will be there for me
5240500	5243700	regardless of what online trans communities say.
5243700	5245700	And I have very deliberately done that
5245700	5248740	because early in my transition back in 2017,
5249300	5253620	I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community
5253620	5255460	for all kinds of emotional support.
5255460	5257060	You know, when you're early in transition,
5257940	5258980	I mean, it just sucks.
5259700	5261620	You feel like the whole world is against you.
5261620	5263700	And I talked about this a little bit in my last video,
5263700	5266580	you know, feeling like a freak show walking down the street.
5266580	5269460	And even if you're lucky enough to have a supportive family,
5269860	5272740	it usually still is gonna take them a while to come around.
5272740	5274020	At first they don't get it.
5274020	5275380	They say things to you like,
5275380	5277220	aren't you worried you'll regret this?
5277220	5279540	And they struggle with your name and pronouns,
5279540	5280900	which is understandable,
5280900	5282180	but at the same time,
5282180	5285220	it makes you feel like you're not being seen for who you are.
5285220	5287540	So you need a kind of second family
5287540	5289300	that understands how you're feeling
5289300	5291460	and acts happy about your transition
5291460	5292820	and validates your gender.
5292820	5295300	And for the first couple months of my transition,
5295300	5299300	I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.
5299300	5301460	Well, that didn't last long because,
5301460	5303940	well, I was, what, two months into my transition
5303940	5305860	when first I did an interview
5305860	5307620	with the journalist Jessie Single,
5307620	5310580	and then I agreed to do a debate with Theron and Vanessa.
5310580	5311540	So that's a long story,
5311540	5314580	but in short, I associated with a string of people
5314580	5317140	that trans Twitter considers the enemy.
5317140	5319780	And trans Twitter tore me apart over this,
5319780	5321460	and it completely broke my heart
5321460	5324260	because I was really leaning
5324900	5328580	on basically emotional support from strangers online,
5328660	5330660	which seems really stupid in retrospect.
5330660	5332100	And after they turned against me,
5332100	5333300	I decided, one,
5333300	5335700	that I was never going to rely on this group of people again,
5335700	5336260	and two,
5336820	5339140	that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.
5339140	5340100	And in retrospect,
5340100	5341860	I think this actually may have been good for me
5341860	5343220	in a roundabout way
5343220	5345300	because I was kicked out of the safe space,
5345300	5346820	and I dropped that mentality.
5346820	5349620	And so basically I was thrown into the deep end of reality
5349620	5351220	and forced to sink or swim.
5351220	5353620	And I don't know if my transition or my channel
5353620	5354900	would be where they are today
5354900	5356900	if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.
5356900	5358100	Are we swimming through fire,
5358100	5359700	or are we mixing metaphors?
5359700	5360580	The point is,
5360580	5363940	I'm more armored against canceling
5363940	5365300	than I was two years ago.
5365300	5366260	And the reason why
5366260	5369940	is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and security
5369940	5371860	and independence from any one community
5371860	5374340	so that if one community cancels me,
5374340	5376100	I still have somewhere else to go.
5376100	5377780	You know, the people who are most vulnerable
5377780	5378900	to cancel culture
5378900	5380580	are not white guy comedians.
5380580	5381780	They're not James Charles.
5381780	5382740	They're not me.
5382740	5384340	They are marginalized people
5384340	5386180	who feel like they have nowhere else to go
5386180	5387940	when they're rejected by their community.
5387940	5390180	That means struggling trans people
5390180	5391940	with a few hundred Twitter followers.
5391940	5393700	It means a lot of sex workers.
5393700	5397380	It means people who totally rely on activist circles
5397380	5399380	for emotional and material support.
5399380	5401380	I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.
5401380	5402820	I had survived my youth
5402820	5404900	because I had never given anyone or any group
5404900	5406100	the right to judge me.
5406100	5408340	That right I had reserved to myself.
5408340	5410420	But the movement seduced me
5410420	5412900	by its sweet promise of sisterhood.
5412900	5414420	It claimed to provide a haven
5414420	5416740	from the ravages of a sexist society,
5416740	5418740	a place where one would be understood.
5418740	5421540	It was my very need for feminism and feminists
5421540	5423220	that made me vulnerable.
5423220	5425860	I gave the movement the right to judge me
5425860	5427060	because I trusted it.
5427060	5429060	And when it judged me worthless,
5429060	5430740	I accepted that judgment.
5431300	5432980	There's a really irritating point
5432980	5435540	that people on the left like to make that goes,
5435540	5438020	well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.
5438020	5440100	Canceled people usually get a new job
5440100	5441300	or keep their platform,
5441300	5443860	so I guess it's not really that bad, huh?
5443860	5445300	I think people say this
5445300	5446980	because they're trying to mitigate
5446980	5448660	any sense of guilt they might feel
5448660	5450100	about how they're treating people,
5450100	5451940	because it's a really stupid argument.
5451940	5453940	There's lots of things that don't end your life
5453940	5455140	that are still terrible,
5455140	5456660	but also there's cases
5456660	5458900	where canceling has ended someone's life.
5458900	5460900	On December 5th, 2017,
5460900	5463060	a porn star named August Ames
5463060	5465700	killed herself by hanging in a public park
5465700	5468820	after being canceled on Twitter over a homophobic tweet.
5468820	5470660	On December 3rd, she tweeted,
5470660	5473140	whichever lady performer is replacing me tomorrow
5473220	5474660	for Erotica X News,
5474660	5476740	you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn
5476740	5477780	just to let you know.
5477780	5479700	BS is all I can say, shrug.
5479700	5482100	Do agents really not care about who they're representing?
5482100	5484660	LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.
5484660	5486340	So I've never worked in porn,
5486340	5488980	so I can't really tell you what the norms are
5488980	5492340	around women working with men who have done gay porn.
5492340	5495060	But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,
5495060	5496580	and that seemed to be the consensus
5496580	5498260	of other industry people on Twitter.
5498260	5499780	So Twitter did its thing,
5499780	5502180	people in August's community called her a homophobe
5502180	5503220	and lashed out at her.
5503220	5504740	And as always happens,
5504740	5506420	plenty of passersby jumped in
5506420	5508580	to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.
5508580	5509620	Over the next few days,
5509620	5511620	August tweeted several more times,
5511620	5513780	going through the usual stages that you go through
5513780	5514980	when you're being canceled.
5514980	5516900	First, she defended herself.
5516900	5518980	She claimed most other women in the industry
5518980	5520100	feel the same as her.
5520100	5521540	Then she said she's bisexual
5521540	5523220	and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.
5523220	5525140	Then she said, fine, I guess I'll be fake
5525140	5526420	and not have opinions then.
5526420	5528500	Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is,
5528500	5529780	and she got really defensive
5529780	5532100	about her right to choose who she has sex with.
5532100	5534420	And she lashed out at the people attacking her.
5534420	5536500	And then in her final tweet,
5536500	5538420	she just said, fuck y'all,
5538420	5541220	and went to the park that night and killed herself.
5541220	5542900	This is all so familiar to me.
5542900	5544980	I feel like I'm able to relive with her
5544980	5547060	each stage of this emotional process.
5547060	5548180	There's that first moment
5548180	5549940	when you realize the outrage is beginning
5549940	5552580	and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.
5552580	5555140	And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.
5555140	5557220	And then the bargaining, the fear,
5557220	5559700	and finally the shame and the despair.
5559700	5560820	And here's the thing,
5560820	5564180	I totally agree with her critics that her tweet was bad.
5564180	5566900	Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,
5566900	5570580	but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.
5570580	5574260	But she was still a person who deserves to live.
5574260	5575780	And I think there's gotta be a better way
5575780	5577460	to deal with these situations
5577460	5580420	than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.
5580420	5581860	And I know it's never as simple
5581860	5583620	as Twitter made her kill herself.
5583620	5586100	There's always other things going on in the background.
5586100	5587780	But the point I'm making is,
5587780	5590660	canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people
5591060	5593060	because marginalized people generally
5593060	5595460	have more things going on in the background.
5595460	5598820	Jon Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death,
5598820	5601940	and it goes into how she was sexually abused as a child,
5601940	5603380	abandoned by her father.
5603380	5604660	She was living with a boyfriend
5604660	5606740	she was kind of emotionally detached from.
5606740	5607780	And a few weeks earlier,
5607780	5609060	she'd filmed a scene with a guy
5609060	5611300	who was unnecessarily rough and mean
5611300	5612660	and who mistreated her.
5612660	5614660	So she was kind of traumatized by that.
5614660	5616820	And so she was kind of on edge
5616820	5619060	and really defensive about who she worked with
5619060	5620020	when she was tweeting.
5620020	5621460	Then the backlash happened.
5621460	5624020	And since she had no other support network,
5624580	5627220	she probably felt like the only community she had
5627220	5628100	turned against her.
5628100	5630580	And that's a really painful feeling.
5630580	5633700	She must have felt so despised.
5633700	5636740	Which is how I've felt for the last two months.
5636740	5640340	I feel despised and burdensome.
5640340	5643380	And I can imagine how a person who feels that way
5643380	5645540	could have an impulsive couple hours
5645540	5647860	where they think their best option is suicide.
5647860	5649220	I mean, I can more than imagine it
5649220	5650740	because I've been there myself.
5650740	5653300	And I'm still here because at those moments,
5653300	5655700	I've been with good friends who took care of me.
5655700	5658660	And by friends, I do mean Xanax.
5658660	5661700	But I've also survived
5661700	5663540	because there's a lot of people on the internet
5663540	5665780	who'd be very entertained if I killed myself
5665780	5668820	and I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.
5668820	5669860	Oh no, bitch.
5669860	5673140	I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.
5673140	5674740	I mean, who needs a guardian angel
5674740	5677060	when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas
5677140	5679220	on the fumes of total contempt?
5679220	5680740	What I'm really trying to say is,
5680740	5683700	Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.
5683700	5706660	Oh, holy night, the stars are bright.
5706660	5714500	The shining meow, meow, meow, meow,
5714500	5719780	meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
5719780	5721780	To get my lesbian pliers out again.
5728100	5731700	Have a super fucking happy new year, bitch.
5731700	5734340	How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?
5734340	5736180	Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?
5736260	5738020	Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.
5738020	5739940	All right, I need to take a deep breath
5739940	5741060	because let's be honest,
5741060	5743140	I'm about one crack away from attacking
5743140	5745220	my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.
5745220	5748660	I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage
5748660	5750980	and making a suit out of women's skin.
5750980	5752340	Just kidding, I would never do that.
5752340	5753620	Though on a bad skin day,
5753620	5755940	I've given it serious consideration.
5755940	5757780	Oh, I'll be fine.
5757780	5759140	I've gotta sober up anyway
5759140	5761700	because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.
5761700	5762820	And plastic surgery,
5763540	5765220	that's about the only thing holding me together
5765220	5765940	at this point.
5767940	5770340	YouTubing, this is a healthy profession.
5770340	5771460	This is great.
5771460	5772660	Anyone want my job?
5773220	5774420	Step right up.
5774420	5776020	All you have to do is make informative
5776020	5776980	and entertaining videos
5776980	5778980	about extremely controversial topics
5778980	5781540	while of course representing the full range of experiences
5781540	5784100	in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum
5784100	5786420	and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.
5786420	5787140	Well, go on.
5787700	5789300	I'm waiting to be entertained.
5789300	5790180	Feed me, mother.
5790180	5791220	Oh, don't mind me.
5791220	5794420	I'll just sit back and pour another glass of wine.
5794420	5797540	Oh, and I will of course be obsessively scrutinizing
5797540	5800580	every word you say for any hint of moral transgression
5800580	5801940	as well as critiquing your look,
5801940	5803620	you third-rate cross-dresser.
5803620	5804900	Zero out of 10.
5804900	5806020	Get off my stage.
5806020	5807940	You successfully spilled that everywhere.
5807940	5808440	That's good.
5809220	5811700	I do still want to talk about why people cancel
5811700	5813060	and the effect that it's having,
5813060	5816260	but it looks like there's gonna have to be a part two gorge
5816260	5817700	because I have hit my limit.
5817700	5819620	So why don't we all cut our losses
5819620	5821860	and try again in 2020, hmm?
5821860	5823220	I realize that people on Twitter
5823220	5825060	aren't actually gonna watch this video,
5825060	5826740	they're just gonna make fun of the title
5826740	5827940	and how long it is,
5827940	5829300	which fair enough,
5829300	5831380	but they're the ones whose accusations against me
5831380	5833140	are so numerous and convoluted
5833140	5835700	it required a feature-length film to respond to.
5835700	5837060	But yeah, they're gonna see the title
5837060	5839700	and they're gonna transcribe quotes out of context
5839700	5841380	and they're gonna say I'm a fascist,
5841380	5842180	I'm a TERF,
5842180	5843060	I'm true scum,
5843060	5844180	I'm the new Blaire White,
5844180	5845380	I'm the new Lacey Green,
5845380	5846820	I'm a cis bootlicker,
5846820	5848340	I'm an enlightened centrist,
5848340	5849380	I'm a shitlib,
5850100	5852740	I'm a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars
5852740	5854580	over the bodies of dead trans women.
5854580	5856500	Mask off, yikes.
5856500	5857780	This ain't it, chief.
5857780	5860500	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.
5860500	5862820	Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?
5862820	5863860	Disappointing.
5863860	5865540	But they're saying all those things already
5865540	5866740	so I'm inoculated.
5866740	5869460	See their mistake was completely breaking my spirit,
5869460	5871620	they should have left a little piece intact.
5871620	5873380	But it's good, it's good, it's good,
5873380	5877540	because basically my survival from here on out
5877540	5881140	hinges on my ability to not care at all
5881140	5882900	what people say about me online.
5883940	5884260	So.
5887140	5889060	Here's to not giving a fuck.
6009380	6016340	This is almost a Norma Desmond cosplay,
6016900	6019860	which is good because I'm not gonna age gracefully
6019860	6022740	and it's the best to get into character now.
6023300	6026580	YouTube stars never die.
