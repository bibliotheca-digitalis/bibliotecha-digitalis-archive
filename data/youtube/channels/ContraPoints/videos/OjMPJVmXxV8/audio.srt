1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help!

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,560
All right, I'm gonna get pliers. The lesbian solution.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay. Let's get started.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,600
I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,280
2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands. All right, no one thinks I'm cute.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about canceling, also known as cancel culture,

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
formerly known as called out culture. And I know you kids know all about this,

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,080
but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
So listen up oldies, in the lingo of these young avocado guzzling smartphone addicts

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,320
who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,120
members of a community by other members of that community. Like so much internet slang,

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,520
this use of the word canceling started out on Black Twitter, where a few years ago people,

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
well mostly women, would tweet cancel R. Kelly and things like that. You know,

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,000
it started out as this vigilante strategy for bringing justice and accountability

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
to powerful people who previously had been immune to any consequences for their actions.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,160
For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,720
abusive men in power who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,600
canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none, and bring justice

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
to prominent abusers. It's in a way the 21st century version of the guillotine,

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,520
the bringer of justice, the people's avenger. But also like the guillotine, it can become

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,160
a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have,

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,120
well, a teensy bit of a reign of terror situation on our hands, Gorge.

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
Now there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
is out of control, you can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,080
jackals trying to get you in trouble. And the other side is mostly progressive think piece

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,880
authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture, it's just that powerful people

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,560
are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it so

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,960
is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,560
He didn't know I was transgender. Storytime, emotional, not clickbait.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's start with an example. The most high profile YouTube canceling of 2019

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,240
was the canceling of James Charles. And again, I know you kids remember this, but

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders. Put the kettle on, Karen.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,760
So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Look, there's these people who make YouTube videos teaching you how to do makeup.

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,520
I certainly can't. It's pretty bomb, it's lit, it's, uh, it's groovy, it's fab, it's far out,

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,560
man, it's a gas, I fully dig it. Free love, give peace a chance, Nixon's a fascist.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,680
So back in May of this year, James' colleague and mother figure, fellow YouTube beauty guru

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Tati Westbrook, uploaded a 40-minute video accusing James of endorsing a different brand

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,160
of hair vitamins than the brand that she, wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,600
An enthralling plotline, I know. And this was huge, this was covered in the New York Times.

44
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,520
And while Tati was at it, almost as an afterthought to the, uh, hair vitamin dispute,

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,560
she also accused James of being a sexual predator.

46
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
Now I actually went back and checked Tati's original deleted video,

47
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
and she actually never uses the phrase sexual predator.

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
It's funny, I remember her calling him that, because that became the story on Twitter.

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
But what she actually said was,

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,320
James had tried to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay, yet again.

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,160
But see, this is what cancel culture does.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
It takes one story and transforms it into a significantly different story.

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,440
You know, the headline I would write about the James and Tati story might read,

56
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,400
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men into thinking they're gay.

57
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,920
But cancel culture transforms that story into the headline,

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,160
James Charles is a sexual predator.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,200
Interesting.

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,000
Now I want to make it clear that my intention here is really not to defend James Charles.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm not a James Charles stan.

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm a biological female in my 30s.

63
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Close to death I know.

64
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
Please leave a comment before I die.

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
That said, I do think the statement,

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
James Charles is a sexual predator,

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
is a stretch to say the least.

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,400
At least based on the information I have in December 2019.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,520
So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.

70
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
Cancel culture trope one.

71
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,480
And you should be writing this down class, because this will be on the test.

72
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Cancel culture trope one.

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Presumption of guilt.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,240
There's a traditional understanding of justice,

75
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,760
according to which, before you condemn or punish a person,

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,000
you hear the accuser's side of the story,

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,320
and the accused's side of the story.

78
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
You allow both sides to present evidence,

79
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,400
and only after everyone involved has had a chance to make their case,

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,280
do you pass sentence and punish the convict.

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
Aw, punish me king.

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
Drinking this is punishment enough.

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Am I uncanceled yet?

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Please?

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
Now in the United States of...

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
We legally have the presumption of innocence,

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720
but canceling does not abide by the law.

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice,

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
and a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,400
Now that's basically the point of the progressive slogan,

91
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
believe victims.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces,

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,200
because out in the world at large,

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,760
people generally don't believe victims.

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,560
But I think it's pretty obvious how believe victims

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,880
is a norm that's easy to abuse.

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
Was Tati really James' victim?

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,320
No, she's not some powerless woman

99
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,040
abused by a prominent man in her industry.

100
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,800
She's on top of the industry,

101
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,600
and she wasn't victimized by James at all.

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,960
I see this case more as she weaponized cancel culture

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480
against a business rival.

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Anyway, before James had even had a chance

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,400
to respond to Tati's accusation,

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,360
the story had already gone from Tati Westbrook

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
accuses James Charles of trying to trick straight men

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,920
to James Charles tried to trick straight men.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,480
And from there, it was generalized into

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,200
James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

111
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
which brings us to cancel culture trope two, abstraction.

112
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,240
Abstraction replaces the specific,

113
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
concrete details of a claim with a more generic statement.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
In the transition from Tati Westbrook

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,200
accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,160
to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

117
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
we've lost not only the sense of this

118
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
being an unverified accusation,

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,680
but we've also lost all the specific details.

120
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
James Charles is toxic and manipulative

121
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
is an incredibly vague statement.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,480
It may as well be James Charles is bad.

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,800
But even without the presumption of guilt,

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
if someone tells me James Charles is accused

125
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
of toxic and manipulative behavior,

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics,

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
and whatever my imagination comes up with

129
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,720
is likely going to be worse

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
than whatever he's actually accused of.

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,160
Also, the specific accusation that he tried

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
to trick straight men into thinking they're gay

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
is self-evidently kind of questionable.

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
If you find out, let me know.

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
It's bad, I'm bad, I'm super bad.

137
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
This is not a problem that straight men

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
usually seem to have.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
At the very least, it requires further explanation.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,880
It's the kind of story that sounds

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
like it has more than one side.

142
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
So I'm immediately gonna feel a little bit skeptical

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
of the accusation.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook,

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
because this accusation is setting off

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,840
my homophobia detection alarm.

147
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,400
Leave the gays alone.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,640
But I'm not gonna have an opportunity

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
to pick up on the potential homophobia

150
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
and be skeptical of it,

151
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
if all I've heard about the situation

152
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

153
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
And I also wanna point out a linguistic shift

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
that's happening here.

155
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
When the claim was James Charles

156
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,400
tried to trick straight men,

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,360
the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.

158
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,400
So what we're criticizing here is James's behavior.

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,

160
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
trying to trick straight men.

161
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
But once the claim morphs into James Charles

162
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
is toxic and manipulative,

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
the verb in the sentence is is, to be.

164
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,280
So these adjectives are characteristics of James,

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,600
and it's now not his actions we're criticizing,

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
but his personality, his toxicity, his manipulativeness.

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,040
This is what I'll call cancel culture trope three,

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
essentialism.

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
Essentialism is when we go

170
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,680
from criticizing a person's actions

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
to criticizing the person themselves.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
We're not just saying they did bad things,

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,560
we're saying they're a bad person.

174
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
And that's what takes us from

175
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
James Charles tried to trick straight men

176
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
to James Charles is a sexual predator.

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
So here, we're targeting James himself,

178
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
not just his actions, but the type of person he is,

179
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560
a sexual predator.

180
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
And we've also really escalated the accusation,

181
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,200
because I don't know about you guys,

182
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,

183
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
the image that comes to mind is a rapist

184
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
or a child molester, maybe an abusive boss,

185
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
not a teenage twink hung up

186
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
on wanting to date straight guys.

187
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
I mean, not that a person like that

188
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
couldn't be a sexual predator,

189
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,600
but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator

190
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
is a fair summary of the accusation.

191
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
So this seems to me like a pretty nasty

192
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
and dishonest twisting of the story,

193
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,640
and it happened instantaneously on Twitter.

194
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
It totally dominated the conversation

195
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
in a community of millions of people for weeks.

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
In a few days, James had lost millions of subscribers,

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.

198
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
Not that anyone seems to care.

199
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
In fact, most people seem to be enjoying his downfall.

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,200
He was a teenage millionaire,

201
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
a young, beautiful superstar,

202
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,440
easy to envy, easy to resent,

203
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.

204
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
What was the point of canceling James Charles?

205
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
Did we want to teach him a lesson?

206
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
Did we want him to learn from his mistakes

207
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
and grow as a person?

208
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.

209
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
Imagine actually caring.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer

211
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,200
was not sincerely outraged and hurt

212
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
by their sincere belief

213
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
that James Charles was a sexual predator.

214
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.

215
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,200
This was a controversy manufactured from the top

216
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.

217
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
I honestly think that most of the

218
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,480
James Charles is a sexual predator crowd

219
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
just wanted to bring him down a peg.

220
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Cancel culture trope four,

221
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,520
If you look at the world we live in,

223
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,240
would you say that people are usually motivated

224
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,080
No, maybe not.

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Let's be real, America.

227
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.

229
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
For Tati, calling out James, this was really,

230
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
it was about the hair vitamins, right?

231
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
I think Sis was super salty that this millionaire kid

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
who she had supported and helped

233
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
and accusing him of trying to trick straight men

235
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
was just a twist of the knife.

236
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,160
But moralism or intellectualism

237
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
provide a phony pretext for the call-out.

238
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
You can pretend you just want an apology.

239
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen

240
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
who wants the person to improve.

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,000
You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
when what you're really doing

243
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
is attacking a person's career and reputation

244
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
out of spite, envy, revenge.

245
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,520
I mean, it could be any motivation.

246
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,000
Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
spoiled little brat,

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face,

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,880
at least for a few weeks.

250
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,480
It's schadenfreude, right?

251
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
This kind of petty sadism.

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,

253
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
but not the most shameful either.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
And that's not to say that everyone

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
canceling James Charles was insincere,

256
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,080
but there's a world of difference

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,760
between cancel R. Kelly and cancel James Charles.

258
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
And I'm interested to know

259
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,080
how these two things came to look the same.

260
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
When James was being canceled,

261
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
I remember being kind of transfixed

262
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
by the sight of his life and career

263
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,560
falling from the sky, full tailspin,

264
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
black smoke spewing out.

265
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,

266
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
lol, did you see James Charles is canceled?

267
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
LOL, LOL, LOL.

268
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
But I looked up at James and I said,

269
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,680
oh God, that's gonna be me someday.

270
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
Stay strong, sister.

271
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't let the bastards get you down.

272
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
Let's switch over to White Claw.

273
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,920
These are cute.

274
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,040
These are fun.

275
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,960
A little more of a feminine moment for me.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,920
They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.

277
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm not even wearing makeup.

278
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.

279
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
Keep drinking, people.

280
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,480
We're gonna make it through this together.

281
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology

282
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
when I was looking into the James Charles canceling,

283
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,200
and I found a bunch of tweets

284
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,000
referencing earlier James Charles scandals.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
Y'all forgiving James Charles?

286
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,280
He's still a transphobe.

287
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,720
Y'all are acting like just because

288
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
James Charles has receipts,

289
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
he's no longer a racist transphobe.

290
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,

291
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,400
and a sexual predator.

292
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,520
A white woman.

293
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,920
Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncanceled.

294
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
So according to Twitter,

295
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,400
James Charles is not only a sexual predator,

296
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,240
he's also a racist and a transphobe.

297
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
That sounds pretty serious.

298
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
Let's investigate.

299
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
We'll start with the transphobia allocation.

300
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,480
Cockerels of the jury, exhibit A.

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
So you're not even full gay?

302
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
I mean, no, there have been girls in the past

303
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
that I've thought were really, really beautiful.

304
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
There's also been trans guys in the past, too,

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,520
that I was really, really into for a moment in time.

306
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,240
And I oop.

307
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
As I say on Twitter, yikes.

308
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
This ain't it, chief.

309
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,640
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

310
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,800
Maybe don't be transphobic.

311
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,920
Disappointing.

312
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,560
So James did fuck up here.

313
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
The problem is he's suggesting

314
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,080
that being attracted to trans men makes him less gay,

315
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,200
which implies that trans men aren't really men,

316
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,280
which is at odds with the way trans men

317
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
understand themselves.

318
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,280
So this does deserve criticism, no doubt, no doubt.

319
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,960
However, what I see when I look at this clip of James

320
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,040
is not a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.

321
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,640
I see a very young person who's still working

322
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,960
on understanding his own sexuality

323
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
and is trying to figure out

324
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
where his attraction to trans men fits into that.

325
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
And it seems to me that the proportionate response

326
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
to that situation is for someone to take James's side

327
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
and explain to him,

328
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,

329
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,760
and here are some tips on how to avoid

330
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,360
saying that kind of thing in the future.

331
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,960
You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.

332
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,600
Not understanding someone is not the same

333
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
as wanting them dead.

334
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Of course, there are committed bigots

335
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
who it's just a waste of time to engage with,

336
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,160
but sometimes just talking to someone

337
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.

338
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,200
But that's not what cancel culture does.

339
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,520
Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation

340
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,560
to the highest possible level of conflict.

341
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
So by abstraction, we get

342
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,640
James Charles made transphobic comments.

343
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,480
And by essentialism, we get

344
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,840
James Charles is a transphobe.

345
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,680
We don't give him a chance to reflect.

346
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,080
We don't give him an opportunity to learn.

347
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,360
We go straight to branding him a bigot.

348
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,280
Nonetheless, that same week,

349
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,320
James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,

350
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
regardless of whatever my intentions were,

351
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,600
that came across as me saying I'm not fully gay

352
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,440
because I have been with a trans man.

353
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
And that is absolutely, first of all, not true.

354
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.

355
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,080
But that stereotype and implication

356
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,000
is really, really dangerous.

357
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
And I'm very, very sorry.

358
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,320
If you are a trans man, you are a man.

359
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.

360
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
You are valid in your identity.

361
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Could you ask for a better apology?

362
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
Like he not only apologizes for what he said,

363
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,600
but he also demonstrates a clear understanding

364
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,280
of why it was wrong.

365
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,200
So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?

366
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,240
Of course not.

367
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.

368
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,920
Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,

369
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,480
no matter how convincingly written or delivered.

370
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
And of course, an insincere apology is further proof

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

372
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Now sometimes, a good apology

373
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,520
will calm things down for a while.

374
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
But the next time there's a scandal,

375
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
the original accusation will be raised again,

376
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
as if you never apologized.

377
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,800
And that's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,

378
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,440
when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.

379
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
And that's to say nothing of this racism

380
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,120
I've been hearing about.

381
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Here's the receipts.

382
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,760
Exhibit B.

383
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,800
In February 2017, when James was much less famous

384
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,640
than he is now, he tweeted,

385
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,560
I can't believe we're going to Africa today.

386
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,480
OMG, what if we get Ebola?

387
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
James, we're fine.

388
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,440
We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,240
Okay, well, that's a little insensitive maybe.

390
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
It's not really something an influencer should tweet.

391
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,840
And fear of disease associated with Africa,

392
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,560
I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area

393
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,320
as certain racist tropes.

394
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
But clearly, this was intended as a joke

395
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,880
about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?

396
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
And anyway, he did apologize, saying,

397
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,800
as a white cis male, I recognize my privilege

398
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,280
and would never want to take that for granted,

399
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,560
but I fucked up.

400
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,800
I feel awful for posting what I said.

401
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,840
I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.

402
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
And James hasn't made a habit

403
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
of making jokes like that ever since, so.

404
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
Is this one tweet from two years ago

405
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
that he apologized for, on its own,

406
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,920
enough evidence for us to justify labeling him a racist?

407
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,040
Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.

408
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,520
Abstraction takes us from two years ago,

409
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
James Charles made a joke that referenced

410
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,680
his fear of getting Ebola in Africa

411
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,720
to James Charles made a racist joke.

412
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
And then essentialism takes us to James Charles is a racist.

413
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't think that's racist.

414
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
Look, I want to pause to say,

415
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
I really do believe in social justice,

416
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,840
at least as much as trash like me believes in anything.

417
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
And believe me, I am well aware that jokes,

418
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,920
irony and even complaints about cancel culture

419
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,600
are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.

420
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video

421
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,680
about how far-right racists use jokes and memes

422
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,040
and mockery of SJWs as a way to camouflage

423
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,760
their hateful beliefs and make them more palatable

424
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
to a wider audience.

425
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,560
So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern

426
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,280
for anti-racism and anti-transphobia,

427
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
as well as an awareness of the fact that cancel culture

428
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,160
is often just a conservative red herring

429
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,240
used to shut down any and all complaints

430
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
about racism or transphobia.

431
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,840
But I've also become very disillusioned

432
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,160
with the way these accusations are thrown around

433
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,880
so frivolously on social media.

434
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,280
By the way, they're used to escalate conflict

435
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
instead of promote understanding.

436
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized

437
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
to destroy people who have made mistakes

438
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.

439
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,360
Now maybe you're thinking, destroyed?

440
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
What do you mean destroyed?

441
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
James is a 20-year-old millionaire

442
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
on his way to owning his own makeup empire,

443
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,760
and you are completely correct.

444
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,

445
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,080
then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.

446
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters,

447
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,720
and they can set you back a few million subscribers

448
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
and a lot of emotional turmoil,

449
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,800
but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.

450
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,160
But here's the thing, what if you're not James Charles?

451
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
What if you're a small creator?

452
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,720
What if you can't afford public relations help?

453
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,040
What if you belong to a marginalized community,

454
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,280
and you rely on that community for support?

455
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
Well in that case, it's a whole different story.

456
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
Let's Irish up this coffee.

457
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
Shaken, not stirred.

458
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
Spilled it all over my pussy.

459
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,640
That's good.

460
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,160
Booze and coffee is a good combination.

461
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm feeling amped right now.

462
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,360
I'm feeling hyped.

463
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,600
So this is the part in the video where I should admit

464
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
that I'm not just a casual observer here.

465
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
At the time of making this video,

466
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
sweaty, I'm super canceled.

467
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,800
You know, I try to make videos

468
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,880
that are both informative and entertaining.

469
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,560
So in this video, the information is

470
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,160
you get to learn about cancel culture,

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,080
and the entertainment is

472
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,160
you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.

473
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Let's get started.

474
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

475
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,400
Hey, how are you?

476
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,080
God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber

477
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,480
who would resort to making videos about my own drama,

478
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,200
but things have gotten to a point.

479
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
I feel like I cannot continue this channel

480
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
until I spill some tea.

481
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
So let's get started.

482
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,960
Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise en scene.

483
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
I've never talked about this on my channel before,

484
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,280
so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

485
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
but I am in fact a transgender woman,

486
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,160
which may come as a big shock to many of you

487
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,920
since I'm 100% real fesh.

488
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,680
I get comments all the time from like very solemn people,

489
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,840
like, guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.

490
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,880
Great work, detective.

491
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
You cracked the case.

492
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,680
You're doing very good, sweetie.

493
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,520
Very, very good.

494
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,360
But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,

495
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
I am a prime target for cancellation,

496
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,400
and I have been canceled many, many times.

497
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
And we're gonna talk about some of the things

498
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
I've been canceled for

499
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,560
and some of the things I've been criticized for,

500
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,880
and the difference between criticism and canceling,

501
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,800
because yes, there is a difference.

502
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,200
As we go along, I will admit where I have made mistakes

503
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
because despite how I look, I am not a literal goddess,

504
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,800
and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.

505
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,560
However, where I believe that criticism of me

506
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,920
is excessive or unwarranted, I will not apologize

507
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,600
because here at ContraPoints Industries,

508
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
we are not in the business of serving bullshit.

509
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,200
So the reason for my current cancellation is,

510
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,960
in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,

511
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
I cast transsexual porn star Buck Angel

512
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
in the role of John Waters.

513
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
And yes, it's a much better story

514
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,240
than the hair vitamin debacle,

515
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
so notify the drama channels, put in a good word for me,

516
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
because sweetie, I'm not here to make friends.

517
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm here to win.

518
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
So basically I'm canceled for collaborating with Buck Angel,

519
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,440
and a lot of trans people think Buck Angel

520
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
is a horrible person.

521
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,680
And so my collaboration with Buck Angel

522
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,280
is evidence that I too am a horrible person.

523
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,960
Cancel culture trope six,

524
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,280
the transitive property of cancellation.

525
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,440
Cancellation is infectious.

526
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
If you associate with a canceled person,

527
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
the cancellation rubs off.

528
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,760
It's like gonorrhea, except doxycycline

529
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
won't save you this time, sweetie.

530
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,840
Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,

531
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,160
on whether Buck Angel is, in fact, a horrible person.

532
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,000
So who is Buck Angel?

533
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.

534
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
He grew up in a world where there was not anything

535
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,040
like the visibility and access to information

536
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,560
about transition we have today,

537
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,720
and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system

538
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
in place for people who wanted to transition.

539
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient

540
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,120
his doctor had ever treated.

541
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,160
In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,

542
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,720
his gimmick at the time being the man with a pussy.

543
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,320
But he also became an activist.

544
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,800
He wanted to create more positive trans representation

545
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,840
within the porn world,

546
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,920
and from there he became a more general educator

547
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,440
and advocate for trans people.

548
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
I first heard about him in the early 2010s

549
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
when I was doing some Googling

550
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,240
about some little gender issues I was having myself,

551
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
although I ended up deciding to remain a female.

552
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people

553
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,600
I'd ever heard about,

554
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,040
and he made an impact on me in part

555
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,720
because you take one look at him and you think,

556
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,040
honey, that's a man, but he was born a woman.

557
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
You can do that.

558
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,320
So it's not like he inspired me to transition or anything,

559
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
it's just, it was one of many moments

560
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,920
along my whole entire gender journey.

561
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,320
So I had positive feelings about Trampot,

562
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
that's what he calls himself, from back then,

563
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,520
and then a few months ago,

564
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,640
when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised

565
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,960
over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,

566
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,320
we'll get to that one later,

567
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.

568
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,840
Dear beautiful human being, I see your pain.

569
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,680
It is okay that you lash out at me.

570
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,960
You do this because I am you

571
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,200
and you are reflecting your self-hate to me.

572
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,280
I am strong and will be here for you forever

573
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,400
and no matter what.

574
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,440
This is my intention as a human being, to help others.

575
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
Love, Buck Angel.

576
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,800
And then the caption, suffering.

577
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,360
That is why the trans community lashes out at each other.

578
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,280
I am very aware of the hate towards me

579
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,640
by some in the community.

580
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
They hate on me and others because they are hurt.

581
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,520
And those were exactly the words I needed to hear

582
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,400
at that moment.

583
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me

584
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
and he said, I love you.

585
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
And I was like, senpai noticed me.

586
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
And so I said, I love you back.

587
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
Then when I was working on Opulence,

588
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,680
I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.

589
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,000
And it was my co-director, Theron, who suggested,

590
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,320
don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?

591
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta.

592
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,440
Let's see if he wants to do it.

593
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,160
And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel

594
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
as John Waters in the video credits.

595
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,040
A trans icon playing a gay icon.

596
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,880
In my head, it was just so, well, iconic.

597
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
So I got in touch with Buck about the line

598
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.

599
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
So here it is.

600
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
The 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.

601
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,120
One must remember, there is such a thing

602
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

603
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

604
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
That's it, children.

605
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
That's why mommy's canceled.

606
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,280
Now, I was aware at the time

607
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,200
that trans Twitter hated Buck Angel,

608
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,040
but my thinking was, well,

609
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,680
trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity

610
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,200
and they certainly hate me.

611
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,360
So I wasn't gonna let that stop me.

612
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,280
Little did I know quite how vicious

613
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,560
things were about to get.

614
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,480
Now, so far, I've been telling this story

615
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
from my point of view,

616
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.

617
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
So I want to pause and contextualize

618
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,280
why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much

619
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
they're willing to cancel anyone

620
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,080
who even associates with him.

621
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
Basically, it all goes back

622
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
to this old debate in the trans community

623
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
known today in Tumblr lingo

624
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
as truscum versus transtrenders.

625
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
So truscum are trans people

626
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,520
who distinguish between true trans people

627
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
and fake trans people,

628
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,040
who they call trenders or too-cutes.

629
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,520
Usually truscum think that what it is to be trans

630
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,840
is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,

631
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
to pursue a medical transition

632
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,040
involving hormones and surgery,

633
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,640
and to socially re-assimilate

634
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
into your target binary gender,

635
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
so male or female.

636
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Anyone who's not that, according to truscum,

637
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,080
must either be a confused teenager,

638
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,600
someone just trying to get attention,

639
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
someone mistaking their trauma

640
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,040
or their fetish for being trans,

641
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,640
in a word, a trender.

642
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
So that's a viz of transness

643
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
that usually excludes non-binary people

644
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,840
as well as people who don't want

645
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,920
to medically transition for whatever reason,

646
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
and for that reason,

647
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,680
this view is sometimes also called transmedicalism,

648
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,760
truscum obviously being the derogatory term

649
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,480
for these people.

650
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,680
So truscum are very hated by a lot of trans people

651
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
because their viewpoint

652
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,960
is that not all trans identities are valid,

653
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,320
and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be truscum.

654
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
So the next question to ask is,

655
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,360
is this true?

656
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
Is Buck Angel, in fact, truscum?

657
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
Now my honest answer to that question is,

658
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't know.

659
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
He's certainly said some things

660
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,480
that sound like things truscum say,

661
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,280
I'll give you that.

662
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
A point he likes to make a lot

663
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,440
is that he's transsexual, not transgender,

664
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
and the difference between those terms

665
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
is sometimes defined as,

666
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,240
transsexual implies that you want

667
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,920
to pursue medical transition,

668
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,360
so hormones and surgery,

669
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,680
and transgender doesn't imply that.

670
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,880
And people associate this

671
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm transsexual, not transgender thing with truscum

672
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,480
because truscum often call themselves transsexuals

673
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,640
and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual

674
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,920
isn't really trans.

675
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,840
And often those people will be very mean

676
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,360
to people they call trenders,

677
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,520
especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers

678
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
like Vanessa LeBlanc

679
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
and Too Cute Smasher 9000.

680
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Too Cute Smasher 9000.

681
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Roast me back, Calvin, I dare you.

682
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,440
But I think it's important to keep in mind

683
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,520
that the term truscum is a product

684
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
of the 2014 Tumblr wars,

685
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
and trying to apply it to trans people

686
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
of an older generation can sometimes be misleading.

687
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,840
Like when Buck Angel transitioned,

688
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,960
the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,

689
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
and he still identifies that way.

690
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,000
So when younger trans people tell him

691
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
it's wrong to use the word transsexual,

692
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,160
he feels like these ungrateful millennials

693
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,840
are invalidating his identity,

694
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
and I do understand where he's coming from with that.

695
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
But I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people

696
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
are skeptical about Buck.

697
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
Like he says again and again,

698
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm transsexual, not transgender,

699
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
like don't mix me up with those people.

700
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
And that eagerness to separate himself

701
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
from transgender people,

702
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
it comes across as hostility.

703
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
Like I don't think he's ever actually said

704
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,400
that nonbinary people aren't valid,

705
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,960
but I personally don't like that he seems like

706
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
he wants to distance himself from them.

707
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,560
And that's my disagreement with Buck.

708
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,200
It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities

709
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
because I don't really see him doing that.

710
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,560
And if he was doing that,

711
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,520
I would have seen it,

712
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
because for the last two months,

713
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,000
a lot of people have been doing nothing

714
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,400
but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.

715
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,040
But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,

716
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,000
and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,

717
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,800
it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.

718
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,960
And I hope he listens to this criticism,

719
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
because I think it would be cool

720
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
if he got better about this.

721
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Of course, Buck is technically right

722
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,680
that there are different kinds of trans people,

723
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
and I agree it's important

724
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,560
that we can make those distinctions

725
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,720
and talk about the differences when they're relevant.

726
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,120
But I also think that as a community,

727
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
trans people benefit from unity, not division.

728
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,880
Like, if you have an employer

729
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
who discriminates against trans people,

730
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
they're not gonna care if you're transsexual,

731
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,680
transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming.

732
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,840
They're gonna discriminate against you regardless.

733
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,520
So we're all in this together,

734
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,280
and there's a lot of disagreements among us,

735
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,440
and we often don't get along so well.

736
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,680
But politically, I think we should work together

737
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,720
as much as possible

738
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
instead of splitting into little factions,

739
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,440
because we share most of the same interests.

740
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
And I think the best way to do that

741
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
is to build bridges instead of burning them.

742
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,960
And that's why I'm willing to work with people

743
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,760
like Buck Angel, who I have some disagreements with.

744
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,520
It creates a connection, you know?

745
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,560
And having that connection can lead to communication

746
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
and build understanding.

747
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.

748
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,120
I am very lonely.

749
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,640
It's not a joke.

750
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,080
It's true.

751
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,840
Now, I get that some people have views

752
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
that are so harmful

753
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,600
that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.

754
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,000
But in any case, I didn't even give Buck a platform

755
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
to share his opinions.

756
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,320
I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.

757
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,080
A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,

758
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,640
why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?

759
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,560
Well, first of all, I don't actually know John,

760
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,800
but I just have a feeling he would write me off

761
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,280
as some kind of tranny millennial SJW.

762
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,880
Like, why is Buck Angel canceled but John Waters isn't?

763
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
Well, because trans Twitter does not know

764
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
who John Waters is.

765
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,280
And let's try to keep it that way.

766
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,880
I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine

767
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,840
who knows John,

768
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,680
and he told me that he and John

769
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,320
have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.

770
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,160
So, plot twist.

771
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me

772
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,920
unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum

773
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,760
and apologize for ever working with him.

774
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
But I'm not gonna do that,

775
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,240
because I don't think it would be the right thing to do,

776
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,640
and doing it just to get myself uncanceled

777
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,600
would be cowardly.

778
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree

779
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,520
with Buck's divisive rhetoric

780
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,600
about transsexual versus transgender.

781
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,160
I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella

782
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,480
instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.

783
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,080
And I'm happy to hear out the perspective

784
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
of non-binary people who don't trust him,

785
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
because I totally get where they're coming from

786
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
and I think that's valid.

787
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,640
But I also respect the decades of good activism

788
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,720
Buck Angel has done for trans people,

789
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
and I am grateful to him for that.

790
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
And in light of that,

791
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt

792
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,040
about where his heart is,

793
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,600
and express my criticism in a more measured way

794
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
than just attacking who he is as a person.

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,920
But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,

796
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,160
because this is the strategy they've chosen

797
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,280
to establish that I am a horrible person.

798
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
And if the true scum allegation

799
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,080
isn't strong enough to prove it,

800
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,720
oh, they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on

801
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,080
to hold up their conclusion.

802
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,800
For example, here's a tweet claiming,

803
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,280
Natalie's trying so fucking hard

804
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,600
to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did

805
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
was write a few iffy tweets,

806
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,320
and that's just so fucking far from the truth.

807
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign

808
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
outing a trans woman against her will,

809
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
with a specific intent

810
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
of causing her physical, emotional, and professional harm.

811
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,880
The shorter way of saying that

812
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,560
is that he wanted to make her suffer,

813
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
and she very well could have been killed.

814
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,080
Yikes.

815
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,360
This ain't it, chief.

816
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,240
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

817
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,480
Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.

818
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
Disappointing.

819
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,040
It sounds pretty serious.

820
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,880
Let's investigate.

821
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
Here's what I've managed to piece together.

822
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,200
Scene one.

823
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,520
The year is 2003, Los Angeles,

824
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,280
where the movie world, the porn world,

825
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
and the BDSM scene come together

826
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,400
in a tale of heartbreak, betrayal, and transsexualism.

827
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,280
La la land.

828
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
Dramatis Personae.

829
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,360
Buck Angel, transsexual porn star.

830
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,880
Ilsa Strix, dominatrix, then-wife of Buck Angel.

831
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,400
Lana Wachowski, wildly successful director of The Matrix,

832
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,040
at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.

833
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,960
The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix

834
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,880
and Buck Angel's marriage ended

835
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,520
after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,

836
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,040
who was not yet out as trans.

837
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,

838
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,080
and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,

839
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,680
told a series of magazines

840
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,000
that this celebrity director Wachowski

841
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,720
was a crossdresser who had stolen his wife,

842
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,920
which I guess was the information he had at the time.

843
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,680
So is that outing a trans woman against her will?

844
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,520
Well, in retrospect, it seems like it,

845
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
though that may not be what he thought

846
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
he was doing at the time.

847
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
But to really get to the bottom of this,

848
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,440
we have to do some digging.

849
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,600
We have to trawl through the dirty details

850
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,680
of trans people's personal histories,

851
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
which I've noticed is one of the internet's

852
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
favorite activities.

853
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
So I actually went on eBay,

854
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,120
and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991, January 2006,

855
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,880
and I'm finally able to reveal

856
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,920
that the seller canceled the order.

857
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
God damn it!

858
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,840
But I was finally able to track down

859
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,680
and translate a Spanish version

860
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
of the Rolling Stone article

861
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,080
from the Wayback Machine,

862
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,600
and I'm finally able to expose the truth.

863
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,180
Stop.

864
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
Freeze exactly where you are.

865
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
Take a look at yourself

866
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,680
and what all of us have been doing

867
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
for the last 30 seconds.

868
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Who does this behavior remind you of?

869
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
If your answer is social justice advocates

870
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,640
fighting for trans equality,

871
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,640
you are incorrect.

872
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
If your answer is creepy stalkers

873
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
who hate trans people,

874
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,680
I am very suspicious of anyone

875
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
whose online behavior prompts me

876
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,920
to dig through articles full of dead names

877
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,920
and sordid scandals involving trans people

878
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,600
from almost two decades ago.

879
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,000
This is very similar to techniques

880
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
used against trans people by internet fascists.

881
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone

882
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
pushing this kind of investigation.

883
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,760
How can you tell the difference

884
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
between a trans anarcho-socialist

885
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,880
with an anime avatar

886
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,720
and a Nazi pretending to be

887
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,280
a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?

888
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
Well, you can't.

889
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,

890
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.

891
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,680
So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,

892
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me

893
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,800
and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason

894
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
they want me to publicly dig up

895
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,720
their 17-year-old divorce drama,

896
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,600
this is none of my fucking business.

897
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
And it's none of yours either,

898
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,440
so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms

899
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,160
where you belong.

900
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,080
Let's Irish up this tea.

901
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,840
Doesn't work as well with tea.

902
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,400
So setting aside any tabloid drama

903
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,120
that may have happened during the Bush administration,

904
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm saying this in the cuntiest way

905
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
and they deserve it.

906
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,840
They fucking deserve the cuntiness.

907
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.

908
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm a lady.

909
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
She's a woman.

910
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,520
The main argument against me

911
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,200
usually references a collage

912
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,360
of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.

913
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
And this is supposed to be definitive evidence

914
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,600
that he is a horrible person

915
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,240
and therefore that I am a horrible person

916
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,840
for collaborating with him.

917
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,080
Well, here's the thing though.

918
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,400
A collage of problematic tweets

919
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
does not define a person.

920
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,800
And I'm very used to being defined that way myself

921
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
so I know how unfair it can be.

922
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,440
Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,

923
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
a lot of people on Twitter

924
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
were already calling me truscum.

925
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
That's been going on a year and a half now.

926
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,

927
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
a bunch of people respond saying

928
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,040
Natalie is truscum,

929
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,400
Natalie is a transmedicalist,

930
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,240
Natalie hates non-binary people,

931
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
and you should really think

932
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,040
what kind of message you're sending

933
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
to your trans and non-binary followers

934
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,560
by platforming her.

935
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,080
And if the person defends me

936
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,840
or argues back in any way,

937
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,560
they say,

938
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,400
I can't believe you're ignoring

939
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,120
the valid concerns of marginalized people.

940
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
You know, they're weaponizing

941
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
their marginalized status as trans people

942
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,320
to isolate and attack another trans person.

943
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
And sometimes this stuff gets to my head too.

944
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,600
I start asking myself,

945
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,520
wait, am I a transmedicalist?

946
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Do I really believe all these awful things

947
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,640
they say I believe?

948
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
But the answer is,

949
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
no, I just don't.

950
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
These things they're saying about me

951
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,760
are 100% not true.

952
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,320
You know,

953
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,560
believe marginalized people is a norm

954
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
that is encouraged in leftist spaces

955
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,840
for good reason,

956
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,480
much like believe victims or believe women.

957
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
And these norms were established

958
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,

959
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,440
which is not to listen to marginalized people

960
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,280
or to victims or to women.

961
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
But any norm can be abused.

962
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,880
And the blunt fact of the matter is,

963
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,560
sometimes marginalized people are wrong.

964
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,120
Sometimes people calling themselves victims

965
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,000
are obscuring a more complicated situation.

966
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,960
And it's even happened once or twice

967
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,120
that a woman has lied.

968
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,600
And the accusation that I'm truscum

969
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,920
is simply false.

970
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,800
I mean, first of all,

971
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,680
I don't even think of my own transgenderism

972
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
as a medical disorder,

973
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,240
much less everyone else's.

974
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,680
I have of course collaborated with Dr. Spiegel et al,

975
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,000
but I will not have my artistry

976
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,840
reduced to mere medicine.

977
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,360
Second, this accusation that I hate non-binary people

978
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,120
is just, no.

979
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,340
No.

980
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,540
Eh.

981
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,360
Eh no.

982
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,800
My thinking about trans identity

983
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,680
has always been informed by non-binary people.

984
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
I used to identify as non-binary myself

985
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,360
before I medically transitioned,

986
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,160
and some of the closest people to me in my life today

987
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
are non-binary trans people,

988
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,880
some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.

989
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,400
It's complicated.

990
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,960
I've also made at least five videos on this channel

991
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,680
arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities

992
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
going back more than three years.

993
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
So that's five out of around 50 videos,

994
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,120
or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,

995
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,880
is about non-binary identity.

996
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
A few months ago I even made a 30-minute video

997
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
called Trans-Trenders,

998
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,240
which uses character dialogue to show

999
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,960
what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.

1000
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,040
But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter

1001
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,680
saying that I'm true scum who hates non-binary people,

1002
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
and their main piece of evidence for that

1003
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,560
is a collage of my problematic tweets.

1004
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
So let's take a look at that.

1005
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
Here's the three tweets that I usually see

1006
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
scrapbooked together as definitive proof

1007
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,480
that I hate non-binary people.

1008
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
This is the first one, from September 2018.

1009
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,120
Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread

1010
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,040
so you can't even see what I'm talking about.

1011
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm sure this is not the experience of many enbies.

1012
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Enbie means non-binary people.

1013
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,640
I leave it to them to articulate

1014
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,520
what enbie existence looks like in a binary world.

1015
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,000
I do not and I cannot speak for them,

1016
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,280
but surely an account,

1017
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,360
God, I used to write like such a nerd,

1018
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,080
but surely an account that begins and ends

1019
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,040
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

1020
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
is pretty weak.

1021
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,240
Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread

1022
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,640
that that tweet has been clipped out of,

1023
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
I was defending myself from accusations

1024
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
that my most recent video at the time,

1025
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,760
The Aesthetic, was anti-non-binary.

1026
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,640
In that video, there's a character named Justine

1027
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,840
who defends a version

1028
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,680
of the performativity theory of gender.

1029
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,120
And basically I made this video

1030
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,960
to express some angst I was feeling

1031
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,760
about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.

1032
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,040
This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,

1033
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
and I've already moved on in my thinking.

1034
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,480
At that time I was very, um,

1035
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,000
my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times

1036
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,520
or else I'm not really a woman.

1037
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,680
My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping

1038
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
with heterosexual men who resemble my father.

1039
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,760
Mmmmmm.

1040
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,600
And anyone who knows anything about trans women

1041
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,000
knows that most of us go through a stage like this

1042
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,200
at some point, and some YouTubers never get out of it.

1043
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,680
But personally, these days,

1044
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
it doesn't matter what I wear.

1045
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,280
It's when I dream their lilies dreams.

1046
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, dragging the Danish girl.

1047
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,120
Well, fuck the Danish.

1048
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,800
I could never abide that sort of person.

1049
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
We all know what I'm talking about.

1050
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,160
You can tell the whisky is getting to me

1051
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,200
because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.

1052
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,480
These things come out, you know.

1053
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,720
You get honest, you get real

1054
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,760
when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.

1055
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,600
Did I just fucking put lipstick

1056
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
outside of the fucking lip liner?

1057
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,040
This is all Lily's fault.

1058
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,320
Lily Alba.

1059
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,520
Fuck her dreams.

1060
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,

1061
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,760
I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.

1062
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,360
And people will say that the fact that

1063
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,640
not every video I make references non-binary people

1064
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,960
is itself enbyphobic.

1065
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,600
As I've said, about one in 10 of my videos

1066
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,800
is about non-binary.

1067
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,160
But not all of them are.

1068
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,880
And I feel entitled to make some videos

1069
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,720
that are just about trans women.

1070
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,200
But still, some people on Twitter were saying

1071
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,080
that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.

1072
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,240
And because she maybe wins the fictional debate

1073
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,280
in the video, I, Natalie Wynn,

1074
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,840
am therefore a transmedicalist.

1075
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,040
Here's the thing, though.

1076
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
The performativity theory of gender,

1077
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,760
the one that Justine defends in that video,

1078
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,840
is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism

1079
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,760
as it is possible to be.

1080
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,960
Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,

1081
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,560
it's neurological, it's hormonal,

1082
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,240
it's diagnosable and treatable.

1083
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,160
Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,

1084
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,920
it's expression, it's performance,

1085
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,080
it's a social phenomenon.

1086
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,720
Phenomenon.

1087
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,840
Phenomenon.

1088
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,400
Phenomenon.

1089
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,480
Phenomenon.

1090
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,440
Phenomenon.

1091
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,320
Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria

1092
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,560
or to any kind of medical concept at all.

1093
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,560
So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,

1094
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,760
performativity is a kind of social constructionism.

1095
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,480
So these are exact opposite theories of gender.

1096
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
Are you following along, class?

1097
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,740
I'm not.

1098
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.

1099
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,560
But some trans people felt invalidated

1100
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,720
by things Justine says in that video.

1101
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
And transmedicalism is another thing

1102
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,600
that makes them feel invalidated.

1103
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,800
So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist

1104
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,520
and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.

1105
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,040
And this is literally just bad media comprehension.

1106
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,720
Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video

1107
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,240
that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.

1108
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,320
And so much of the negative response to that video

1109
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,680
is just pure emotion.

1110
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,480
I always hear, I don't care what you intended,

1111
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,640
trans people were hurt by that video.

1112
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
You hurt trans people.

1113
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,600
But here's the thing,

1114
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,160
just because you were hurt by content I made

1115
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,240
doesn't mean that the content is bad

1116
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,400
or that I'm victimizing you in some way.

1117
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,760
I'll give you an example.

1118
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
I did a stream a couple years ago

1119
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,080
with a BDSM and kink activist.

1120
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,760
We were talking about various kinks

1121
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,080
and we got to DDLG, which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.

1122
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,400
Basically when consenting adults roleplay age difference

1123
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,480
and the power dynamic that comes with that.

1124
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
And me and this kink activist

1125
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
who are just casually discussing what DDLG is,

1126
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,760
what it isn't, when I noticed someone in the chat

1127
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,680
was starting to totally freak out.

1128
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,960
They were typing in all caps,

1129
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,320
like my abuser used DDLG to justify raping me.

1130
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,080
Why are you defending my abuser?

1131
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,400
I can't believe you'd betray me like this.

1132
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Please stop taking my abuser's side.

1133
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,760
Please stop, I'm begging you.

1134
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,560
This was actually really fucking upsetting to me

1135
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,280
because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.

1136
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,360
They were having a panic attack

1137
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,080
because they were having a trauma trigger reaction

1138
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,360
to this conversation.

1139
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,840
And I kept telling them to leave the stream

1140
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,400
and take care of themselves, but they wouldn't do it.

1141
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,520
So I had to block them and then later get in touch

1142
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,720
and make sure they were okay.

1143
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,240
Now, was their pain very real?

1144
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,880
Yes.

1145
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,600
Was it triggered by the content I was streaming?

1146
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:06,880
Yes.

1147
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,560
But does that mean I did anything wrong?

1148
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,480
No.

1149
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,120
Is it wrong to talk about kink in contexts

1150
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,280
where it's clear you're going to be talking about kink?

1151
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,800
No.

1152
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,120
But when you produce content online

1153
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,720
that's going to be viewed by thousands

1154
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,000
or millions of people,

1155
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,840
there's always some people out there

1156
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,520
who are going to be hurt by it.

1157
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,560
So if you want to argue that a tweet or a video I made

1158
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,840
is somehow immoral,

1159
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,880
I think you need more of an argument

1160
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,800
than just people were hurt.

1161
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,720
All right, back to the tweet.

1162
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
To this day, people quote tweet the sentence,

1163
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,040
but surely an account that begins and ends

1164
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,440
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

1165
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,320
is pretty weak.

1166
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,960
And they claim this is evidence that I'm true scum

1167
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
or that I think people have to prove

1168
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,160
their identities somehow,

1169
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,200
which is not at all what I was saying in that thread.

1170
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,880
What I was saying is,

1171
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,520
if you're trying to persuade a skeptic

1172
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
that trans identity is valid,

1173
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
simply saying I'm not a man

1174
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,960
because I don't identify as one

1175
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,480
isn't a very good argument,

1176
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,840
which it isn't.

1177
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that

1178
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,880
so far as I'm aware.

1179
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
That said, I do now disagree with the mindset

1180
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,440
I had when I tweeted this.

1181
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
Back then, I still delusionally believed

1182
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,080
that it was possible to rationally explain

1183
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,920
why trans identity is valid,

1184
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,400
and I was simply looking for a more persuasive argument

1185
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,320
than this is how I identify,

1186
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,040
you have to believe me, no further questions.

1187
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,640
But I no longer believe there can be

1188
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
any rational justification of gender identity,

1189
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
which is another reason I'm not a transmedicalist.

1190
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,320
Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory

1191
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,160
about why trans identity is valid,

1192
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
and I don't think it succeeds as that.

1193
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,600
I don't think anything does.

1194
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,920
My current opinion about this is that

1195
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,560
I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

1196
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,080
is as good, or rather as bad, an argument as any.

1197
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,920
You know, some things in life

1198
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,240
just can't be rationally explained.

1199
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,800
Like love.

1200
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,120
Why do you love the person you love?

1201
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,280
Well, because you love them.

1202
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,560
You could write a poem about it

1203
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,320
or some gay shit like that,

1204
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,560
but you can't give any actual arguments.

1205
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,840
And why am I a woman?

1206
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,160
Because I'm a woman.

1207
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,440
That's it.

1208
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,360
I mean, I can describe my experiences

1209
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,840
and my feelings to you to help you understand better,

1210
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,720
but I can't logically prove anything.

1211
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,760
And I'm super fucking sorry if you can't handle

1212
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,640
that mankind was set adrift in an absurd world.

1213
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,960
That must be super fucking hard for you.

1214
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,080
Tell me all about it.

1215
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,840
Next please.

1216
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,880
Okay, again we're mid-thread with missing context,

1217
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,000
but the tweet says,

1218
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,640
whereas I've met 20-year-olds in full-on boy mode

1219
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,200
who are like,

1220
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,640
hi, I'm a trans woman.

1221
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,080
She, her pronouns.

1222
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,640
So, I guess by including this tweet

1223
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,680
in the ContraPoints is Problematic collage,

1224
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,880
people are implying that I don't think it's valid

1225
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,600
for someone who presents male to identify as a woman

1226
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,280
and request she, her pronouns.

1227
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,800
Well, that's not true.

1228
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,880
I was surprised when I first experienced this,

1229
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,400
but I think it's valid.

1230
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:56,900
Next.

1231
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,320
Okay, mid-thread, no context once again,

1232
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,360
but now you go into these leftist Discord slash Facebook groups

1233
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,800
and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.

1234
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,520
Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.

1235
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,040
That seems to be the future.

1236
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,960
Okay, well, it's true that many leftist Discord servers

1237
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,920
are like this,

1238
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,040
but reading this back,

1239
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,360
I don't like the way the phrase

1240
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,400
conventional binary transsexuals is hitting my ear.

1241
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,360
I can see how it could imply that non-binary identities

1242
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,240
are somehow newfangled, which isn't true.

1243
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,160
There's been non-binary people for longer

1244
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,880
than there's been medical transsexuals, in fact,

1245
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,200
so we'll call this a bad tweet.

1246
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,040
I apologize for tweeting it,

1247
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
and I apologize to any non-binary people

1248
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,200
who felt trivialized by it.

1249
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,000
Okay, this is the big one.

1250
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,120
This tweet got its own article in the fucking Guardian.

1251
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
You know, I really wish people would pay less attention

1252
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,360
to the tweets I spend 30 seconds writing

1253
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,120
and a little more attention to the videos

1254
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,160
that I spend, you know, hundreds of hours making.

1255
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,320
Anyway, let's look at the tweet.

1256
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,200
This is the most scrutinized paragraph I've ever written,

1257
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,280
and it's so mediocre.

1258
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,080
This has happened to me before in hyper-woke spaces,

1259
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,840
like it's me and a bunch of cis women,

1260
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,320
and we all have to go in a circle saying she, her,

1261
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,360
because I'm there.

1262
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,600
There's this paradox where I can go to a sports bar

1263
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,920
in North Carolina and be Miss Mammed all night,

1264
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,440
no question, but in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,

1265
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,960
I have to explain my pronouns

1266
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,520
and watch woke people awkwardly correct themselves

1267
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,360
every time they say you guys.

1268
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,600
I guess it's good for people who use they, them only

1269
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,360
and want only gender-neutral language,

1270
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,280
but it comes at the minor expense

1271
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,000
of semi-passable transes like me,

1272
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and that's super fucking hard for us.

1273
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,320
So people interpreted this tweet

1274
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,840
as me being against the practice of sharing pronouns,

1275
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,720
which I'm literally just not.

1276
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,000
Like, I've actually been the person

1277
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,960
who initiates the pronoun circle many times.

1278
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,840
The backstory of this tweet is basically that

1279
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,720
I once got triggered in a situation

1280
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,720
where I was with a bunch of cis women

1281
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,440
and we all had to go around saying our pronouns,

1282
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,160
and like a typical triggered tranny,

1283
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,240
I tiptoed over to Twitter to tip-tap type it out.

1284
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,400
But here's the thing, by the end of this thread,

1285
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,240
I had already talked myself away

1286
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,640
from the initial frustration I was expressing.

1287
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
If you know my videos and my voice,

1288
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,000
then you know me saying,

1289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,640
it comes at the minor expense of semi-passable transes,

1290
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,040
and that's super fucking hard for us is sarcastic.

1291
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,200
It's a minor expense.

1292
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,080
It's not actually very hard for us, Gorge.

1293
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,960
It's fine.

1294
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,480
But people on Twitter don't watch my videos

1295
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,640
and they don't get sarcasm.

1296
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,840
So people flipped out over this.

1297
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,920
I was getting dragged,

1298
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,840
and I made the poor decision

1299
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,040
to try to solve the tweet problem with more tweeting,

1300
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,360
which 100% of the time

1301
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,800
is like trying to put out a fire with lighter fluid.

1302
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,840
So me and my dumb brain did another short thread

1303
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,520
trying to clarify what I was saying

1304
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,160
and defending my right to talk about my own experiences,

1305
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,560
that didn't make things any better.

1306
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,440
So in a state of anger and frustration,

1307
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,520
I tweeted out yet another thread.

1308
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,560
And this time I said some truly stupid things,

1309
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,800
including the now infamous line,

1310
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,200
I sometimes feel like the last

1311
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,280
of the old school transsexuals.

1312
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,760
I honestly don't know what the fuck

1313
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,600
I was even trying to say.

1314
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,280
I don't feel like the last of the old school transsexuals.

1315
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,280
I don't even know what that means.

1316
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,800
I guess I basically meant that offline,

1317
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,040
I don't have any radical aspirations.

1318
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,880
You know, I want to be inconspicuous.

1319
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,080
I want to blend in.

1320
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,160
And that's what I meant by old school.

1321
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,720
You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.

1322
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,040
You know, it's funny because it is very different

1323
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,320
from the way I am online

1324
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,960
where I'm totally shameless and open.

1325
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,120
I'm like, sexual confession, everybody.

1326
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,560
Sexual confession.

1327
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,160
I have abnormal urges.

1328
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,080
It's 1am.

1329
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,640
My neighbors can definitely hear that.

1330
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,320
They know I have abnormal urges now.

1331
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,440
They already knew that.

1332
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,040
But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,

1333
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,560
like a total coward.

1334
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,120
So, this was a rage thread,

1335
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,440
and I apologize for tweeting it.

1336
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,040
Let's go back to Bug Angel.

1337
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,840
I'm kind of a conscientious objector

1338
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,520
to the practice of condemning someone

1339
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,440
based on a collage of their worst tweets

1340
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,800
taken out of context.

1341
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,520
But I definitely do have anxiety about this.

1342
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,600
Like, I think I'm doing the right thing

1343
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,920
by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,

1344
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,720
but I mean, I could be wrong.

1345
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,960
What if I am basically sacrificing myself

1346
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,000
for the sake of a person

1347
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,400
who really is as bad as Twitter says?

1348
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,

1349
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,120
fuck non-binary people,

1350
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,720
and then I'll have fucked up.

1351
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,240
This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.

1352
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,760
But I do believe that by refusing to participate

1353
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,520
in the anti-Buck Angel pile-on,

1354
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,680
I am erring on the morally safer side of things.

1355
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,160
Because even if he is a little true scummy,

1356
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,480
excommunicating him from the trans community

1357
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,360
is still probably not the best approach to take.

1358
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,080
In my experience,

1359
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,600
when people accept binary

1360
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,360
but not non-binary trans people,

1361
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,320
it usually takes like a 30-minute conversation

1362
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
to win them over to some level

1363
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,840
of non-binary acceptance.

1364
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,440
And I'll give you a couple examples.

1365
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,360
The first time I was ever canceled,

1366
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,600
like totally trashed on Twitter,

1367
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,280
was back in 2017,

1368
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,440
when I had not yet medically transitioned,

1369
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,000
and at the time, I identified as non-binary.

1370
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,480
And at VidCon 2017,

1371
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,960
I met up with a YouTuber named June,

1372
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,240
who had made some videos

1373
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,520
where she basically mocked the idea of non-binary people.

1374
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,120
And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June

1375
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,080
and some other people,

1376
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,440
but let's keep them out of it.

1377
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,520
And people on Twitter totally dragged me

1378
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,200
for being a peak liberal bootlicker

1379
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,280
who's best friends with transphobic abusers.

1380
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,200
Oh, Christ.

1381
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,800
Fucking people, man.

1382
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,200
So fucking frustrating.

1383
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,840
And you know, I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,

1384
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,000
because I don't know what her thought process was,

1385
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,800
but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,

1386
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,600
and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.

1387
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,520
And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.

1388
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
Example two.

1389
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,200
A couple months later,

1390
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,480
I did a live stream

1391
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,120
with a conservative trans woman YouTuber named...

1392
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,960
What was her name?

1393
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,920
Sharon?

1394
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,840
Sharon? Was it Sharon?

1395
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,080
I guess she's just not a very memorable person.

1396
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,920
Anyway, she had made some videos

1397
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,400
saying that non-binary identities aren't real,

1398
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,680
but I gave her a chance,

1399
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,800
and she surprised me

1400
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
by being super compassionate and thoughtful.

1401
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,000
By the end of that stream,

1402
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.

1403
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,680
So again, the point is not

1404
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,520
that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.

1405
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,040
If I was a persuasive genius,

1406
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,360
maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.

1407
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,440
The point is that sometimes,

1408
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,760
people who seem ignorant or hateful

1409
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,320
just need to be given a non-judgmental space

1410
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,160
to learn and grow and think.

1411
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots

1412
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,080
actually prevents that growth from happening.

1413
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,400
And Sharon, despite her, you know,

1414
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,920
totally forgettable personality,

1415
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,320
turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.

1416
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:06,960
Like later on,

1417
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,840
she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,

1418
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,440
and I became good friends with her,

1419
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,640
and we worked together

1420
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,560
on most of the videos I've made this year.

1421
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,240
You know, until she ruined my life

1422
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,640
by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.

1423
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,080
I guess the moral is

1424
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,240
never talk to people you disagree with.

1425
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,000
It will only lead to pain.

1426
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,360
I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.

1427
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,000
Like, I'm crying three times a day.

1428
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,160
Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators

1429
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,600
in at least three of my holes.

1430
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,040
It happens like once a month.

1431
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,480
There has to be a full moon.

1432
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,840
I honestly only still bother

1433
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,920
because it numbs the pain for a few moments.

1434
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,040
What I'm trying to say is

1435
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,960
I really do believe in conversation,

1436
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,360
which means hearing out multiple perspectives.

1437
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,280
I don't want my audience to get all their information

1438
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
about trans people from me,

1439
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,360
and I think it's important to listen to criticism.

1440
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
So I encourage my audience to go watch

1441
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,160
some non-binary YouTubers who have criticized me

1442
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,680
and criticized Buck Angel.

1443
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,520
For example, go check out

1444
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,480
non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,

1445
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,920
and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.

1446
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,560
I think YouTube as a platform

1447
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,480
is better at producing criticism rather than canceling,

1448
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,080
and I think that's because, at least in the vlog format,

1449
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,800
making a video forces you to confront the fact

1450
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,760
that you're a human being with a face and a name

1451
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,400
who can be held accountable for the things that you say.

1452
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,800
But people on Twitter, it's a different story,

1453
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,080
and I think it's time we take a look

1454
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,840
at what canceling really is.

1455
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,600
I've given you enough context now

1456
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,840
for you to understand what I'm about to show you,

1457
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,160
which is what I saw on my timeline every day

1458
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,440
for nearly a month.

1459
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,600
All these tweets are from the aftermath

1460
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,320
of my uploading opulence two months ago,

1461
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,720
when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.

1462
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,400
And someone better hold my hand now,

1463
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,440
because this gets ugly.

1464
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:01,440
Hey, if any of you still support Contrapoints

1465
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,040
after her bigging up and collaborating

1466
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,080
with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,

1467
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,160
you're no friend to gender non-conforming,

1468
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,560
non-passing, and non-binary trans people.

1469
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,280
Fuck her, and fuck her fucking rift.

1470
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,760
I am absolutely furious right now.

1471
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,200
Weird how I'm 30 and trans

1472
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,720
and manage not to be a true scum?

1473
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,320
Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.

1474
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,240
Or maybe Contrapoints is a conniving,

1475
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,920
rat-fucking capo who could do

1476
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,320
with a fully-wound backhand to the mouth.

1477
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,920
Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,

1478
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,160
I just want to say fuck Contrapoints,

1479
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,600
her sycophantic stance,

1480
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,320
and all her bread-tube chums who close ranks

1481
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,680
to protect her after she throws

1482
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,960
the rest of the trans community

1483
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,480
under the bus for profit.

1484
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,400
Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.

1485
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,040
Contrapoints videos are now just style over substance,

1486
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,320
so that explains why she took

1487
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,000
to TERF ideology so well.

1488
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,680
Contrapoints working with true scum

1489
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,080
now definitively proves that pretty much

1490
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,600
everyone defending Contrapoints

1491
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,160
just hates enbies and are also true scum.

1492
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,920
Legit gonna start unfollowing peeps

1493
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,080
that continue to follow Contrapoints at this point.

1494
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,720
Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.

1495
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,480
I know there are some that were probably

1496
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
blindsided by this somehow.

1497
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,040
So long as you know that Contrapoints is true scum,

1498
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,880
you're safe and cool.

1499
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,240
Eat shit, Natalie.

1500
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,240
For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,

1501
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,760
we expected more from you,

1502
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,240
but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,

1503
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,920
it's hard to consider others.

1504
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,160
Contrapoints more like disappoints.

1505
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,000
That's a good one.

1506
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,920
If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.

1507
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,280
Fuck Buck Angel.

1508
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,560
Fuck Contrapoints.

1509
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,040
Fuck any real transsexual.

1510
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,160
Fuck your grift.

1511
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,600
Here's what hashtag Contrapoints stans don't understand.

1512
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,600
If Natalie refuses to accept

1513
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,280
that she has an apology to make

1514
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,040
and continues profiting from it,

1515
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,120
it will become our responsibility

1516
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,720
to work on deplatforming her

1517
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,200
just like every other racist, sexist,

1518
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,720
bigoted content creator.

1519
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,720
No one has actually suggested or attempted

1520
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,000
to actually cancel her,

1521
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,160
but the longer this goes on without an apology

1522
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,600
and commitment to do better,

1523
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,200
the stronger the case becomes

1524
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,600
for actively working to deplatform her.

1525
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,720
So in other words,

1526
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,720
no one has suggested we cancel her,

1527
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,320
but we should cancel her.

1528
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,000
Great.

1529
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,640
Can everyone finally agree that Contrapoints belongs

1530
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,640
directly inside a garbage can?

1531
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,920
Here I am, sweetie.

1532
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,240
Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck.

1533
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,520
Angel Buck.

1534
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,720
Thanks for letting us all know

1535
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,760
that you had no idea who he even was

1536
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,720
until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.

1537
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,280
Contrapoints collaborating with Angel Buck,

1538
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,000
a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person

1539
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,520
to try and destroy them,

1540
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,480
and supporting him

1541
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
because he looks and sounds like a proper man

1542
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,880
isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.

1543
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,320
This is a huge deal.

1544
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,120
Contrapoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.

1545
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,080
We have a Hitler comparison.

1546
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,040
Could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.

1547
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,240
And y'all would be like,

1548
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,200
oh well, she's just a little flawed, you know.

1549
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,000
Fuck off.

1550
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,240
Can Natalie Wynn stop being a coward

1551
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,760
and commit to being a transmed?

1552
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,560
It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.

1553
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,320
Natalie Wynn is a spoiled brat

1554
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,240
who refuses to take accountability.

1555
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,680
Anyone who supports Natalie Wynn

1556
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,600
does not support non-binary people.

1557
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,640
Natalie Wynn is such a terrible person, my god.

1558
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,200
Every cis and non-binary person

1559
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,360
who thought Natalie Wynn wasn't transmed

1560
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,800
now owes me and every non-binary person $50.

1561
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,960
Joe Biden has a better position on the validity

1562
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,120
of non-binary gender than Contrapoints.

1563
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,320
My opinion is that Contrapoints really sucks a lot

1564
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,440
and I don't like her.

1565
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,040
I hate Contrapoints so goddamn much it's unbelievable.

1566
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,400
Contrapoints be like,

1567
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,320
excuse me, non-binary people.

1568
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,480
This is a very good impression of me.

1569
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,840
You're doing very good, sweetie.

1570
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,360
You're doing very, very good.

1571
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,200
Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer, bootlicker, and true scum.

1572
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,480
Any association with him must be seen as hostile

1573
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,320
to the trans community as a whole,

1574
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,880
let alone denial of non-binary existence.

1575
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,040
That's the line in the sand, folks.

1576
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,800
Where do you stand?

1577
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,960
And here we fucking are, dude.

1578
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,560
Buck fucking Angel on Contrapoints.

1579
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,960
Eat my entire ass.

1580
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,520
What, what?

1581
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,520
This is Natalie.

1582
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,680
Natalie is a trans medicalist.

1583
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,680
This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.

1584
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,600
Lindsay is a left-tuber.

1585
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
Natalie and Lindsay are still friends

1586
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,800
because Natalie and Lindsay are both cowards.

1587
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,880
Left-tube is a griv.

1588
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,400
Oh, and they made me the man.

1589
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,360
The shade.

1590
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,960
Issues that arose with being in Contra's new video.

1591
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,880
Her video on TERFs make no sense now.

1592
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,280
Her video on trans-trenders make no sense now.

1593
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,480
You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel

1594
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,160
totally contradicts the videos

1595
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,080
I've spent hundreds of hours making,

1596
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,720
do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?

1597
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,920
Apparently not.

1598
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,760
Her apology is completely void,

1599
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,480
sends a message that she hates non-binary people,

1600
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,240
she is reckless with her content,

1601
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,000
positives that arose from Buck Angel

1602
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,520
being in Contra's new video.

1603
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,240
She has $400,000 this month from Patreon.

1604
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,800
400,000.

1605
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,960
This number is completely made up.

1606
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,440
Like, it is exponentially wrong.

1607
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,760
$400,000.

1608
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,440
$400,000 a month.

1609
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,080
Hot take.

1610
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,320
ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.

1611
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,240
Personally, I like to characterize her

1612
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,840
as the Blair White wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.

1613
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,800
Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit

1614
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,920
who still has not apologized for platforming True Scum

1615
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,000
and is actively taking their side.

1616
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,560
Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,

1617
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,080
get the hell away from me.

1618
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,440
Pee pee poo poo.

1619
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,640
I'm ContraPoints and I can't stop being a trans-medicalist

1620
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,320
and shitting myself in public.

1621
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,800
Valid criticisms of marginalized people.

1622
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,640
Fuck ContraPoints.

1623
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,400
Fuck True Scum.

1624
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,240
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

1625
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,000
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

1626
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,920
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

1627
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,840
ContraPoints is a True Scum.

1628
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,120
ContraPoints is a True-

1629
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,360
You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence

1630
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,120
over and over again, it doesn't-

1631
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,880
You know when you repeat the same sentence

1632
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,800
over and over again, it actually doesn't get more persuasive.

1633
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,120
In fact, it might get less persuasive

1634
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,840
because true things usually only have to be said once.

1635
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,120
If you still support ContraPoints,

1636
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,800
unfollow me immediately and never interact with me again.

1637
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,200
In conclusion, fuck Natalie Wynn

1638
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,280
and fuck everything she has to say.

1639
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,320
Okay, let's get started.

1640
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,160
So that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.

1641
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,240
And all of this, let me remind you,

1642
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,200
is over a 10-second voiceover clip

1643
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,520
and a 48-minute video about a completely unrelated topic.

1644
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,200
Like, how do you work?

1645
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,720
How do you create when a decision so trivial

1646
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,440
can become the main event for weeks of your life?

1647
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,200
And the tweets are just the beginning.

1648
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,800
After that, there's the Reddit threads

1649
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,280
and the YouTube comments and the Facebook discourse

1650
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,840
and the Medium posts and the Newsweek article.

1651
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
Opulence is a video me and Theron spent hundreds of hours

1652
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,440
carefully piecing together.

1653
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,960
I think it's my best video.

1654
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,000
And to have the response to it completely overwhelmed

1655
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,240
by one minor casting decision

1656
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,640
is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.

1657
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,000
And it's left me with much less energy to create new things.

1658
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,120
But here's the thing,

1659
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,360
people on Twitter saying mean things about me

1660
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,160
is not the worst of it, not even close.

1661
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,960
Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman

1662
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,720
who publicly transitioned while making anti-fascist content

1663
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,960
on a notoriously right-wing platform.

1664
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,480
Ah, sweaty, I am so used to reading mean things

1665
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,920
about myself online,

1666
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,720
most of you probably can't even begin to imagine

1667
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,920
how used to it I am.

1668
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,560
And the way you psychologically survive in that situation

1669
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,520
is you block the people and platforms who are harassing you

1670
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,040
and you pay it no mind.

1671
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,440
But there's some things you can't block.

1672
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,840
And a big one is you can't block people

1673
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,160
from going after your friends and colleagues.

1674
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,880
And that is exactly what people did to me

1675
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,200
at the height of the Buck Angel incident.

1676
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,680
Lindsay Ellis, Ollie from Philosophy Tube,

1677
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,720
and Hbomberguy all got inundated with tweets

1678
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,200
demanding that they publicly disown me,

1679
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,680
a person they've all been friends with for years, or else.

1680
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,400
In response to demands that she apologize,

1681
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,560
Lindsay released a statement where she said,

1682
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,640
I was not involved in opulence.

1683
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,080
My name was mentioned in it,

1684
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,480
but I did not participate in the production.

1685
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,000
Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,

1686
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,640
I have to ask, apologize for what?

1687
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,960
There is only one logical answer.

1688
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,480
Apologize for being friends with Natalie.

1689
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,560
And here's a response to her statement.

1690
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,720
I don't need to consider you my fucking friend

1691
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,280
to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit

1692
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,880
or allow on your platform.

1693
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,000
Same with Contra.

1694
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,560
It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas

1695
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,120
to fester for the sake of financial gain,

1696
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,560
which is fine, but it makes you a piece of shit.

1697
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,560
And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.

1698
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,240
I doubt that you are gonna read this,

1699
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,160
but can you please just tell us your thoughts

1700
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,600
on that whole situation

1701
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,800
so we could at least know that you were on our side?

1702
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,240
We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all

1703
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,400
and cause BreadTube to go into a schism

1704
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,920
as a result of this.

1705
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,420
Thank you.

1706
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,440
Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.

1707
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,840
Would be a shame if someone cancelled it.

1708
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,120
Oh, so fucking sinister.

1709
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,080
Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement

1710
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,600
affirming his support of non-binary people, but adding,

1711
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,400
Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,

1712
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
had my private life speculated on,

1713
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,160
and my loved ones insulted.

1714
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,760
In recognizing the feelings of those

1715
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,480
who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,

1716
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,040
I do not wish to legitimize the great many people

1717
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,480
who use their hurt as a cover

1718
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,120
for unacceptable, toxic, and abusive behavior.

1719
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,200
And here's some responses to Oli.

1720
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,440
As a non-binary fan of yours,

1721
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,920
I'm disappointed in this non-apology.

1722
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,080
Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?

1723
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,000
Ever having associated with me?

1724
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,280
Thinks we are going to criticize Oli of PhilosophyTube for

1725
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,400
being a sniveling, hypocritical piece of shit

1726
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,400
refusing to listen to trans people,

1727
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,560
actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking

1728
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,960
the trans people he refuses to listen to.

1729
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,240
Thanks for the apology.

1730
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
Now stop endorsing ContraPoints.

1731
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,280
Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing

1732
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,520
is demanding that cis people publicly condemn

1733
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,320
a trans woman for loosely associating

1734
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,840
with another trans person.

1735
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,800
Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?

1736
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,520
Even Mia Mulder, a trans woman who is never

1737
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,200
publicly associated with me,

1738
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,560
got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli,

1739
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,080
you know, after he made the post

1740
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
discussing being doxxed and threatened.

1741
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,200
And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.

1742
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,560
I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list of people

1743
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,080
that have stood by ContraPoints

1744
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,800
as she's continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.

1745
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,400
To which Mia responds,

1746
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,360
stood by ContraPoints? Jesus Christ.

1747
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,120
No matter what I do, people call me out

1748
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,560
and I'm not even related to the video

1749
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,920
and I don't even know Natalie.

1750
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,320
The chain of guilt by association is so long and twisted

1751
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,000
I can barely even follow it.

1752
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,400
So they're going after Mia, who tweeted a heart at Oli,

1753
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,320
who failed to condemn me for my voiceover casting

1754
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,160
of Buck Angel, who was retweeted by a TERF.

1755
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,480
We're only missing a couple degrees of separation

1756
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,960
before every living person on the planet Earth

1757
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,920
is counseled over the Buck Angel situation.

1758
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,240
And several colleagues of mine, by the way,

1759
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,760
Lindsay, Harry, Oli,

1760
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,080
they all took a financial hit over this.

1761
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,920
They've all lost some Patreon support.

1762
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,320
One of Lindsay's former supporters even demanded

1763
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:35,760
a $38 lifetime refund, saying,

1764
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,400
Dear Lindsay, I'm sorry for being pushy,

1765
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,440
but I really am going to be needing a refund.

1766
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,640
I gave money to your operation under the pretense

1767
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,120
that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable

1768
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,680
and supporting ContraPoints and blaming us

1769
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,840
for taking issue with that is, in my opinion, amoral.

1770
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,040
Please respond.

1771
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
I hope she sent it to them in pennies.

1772
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,920
So look, I'm very grateful to my colleagues

1773
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,920
for sticking by me through all this,

1774
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,360
but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden

1775
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,280
to anyone who associates with me.

1776
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,280
I have no collaborators in this video.

1777
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,520
I'm working on this totally alone

1778
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,800
because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,

1779
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,280
and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.

1780
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,760
During the height of this most recent canceling,

1781
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,720
a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,

1782
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,960
I cut the shout out to you in my last video

1783
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,000
because I was nervous to draw the ire of your detractors,

1784
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,760
who are getting genuinely scary,

1785
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,320
but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,

1786
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,040
regardless of how many people are asking me to.

1787
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,280
Jesus Christ.

1788
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,400
The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,

1789
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,800
or even associates with me in any way,

1790
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,560
will be labeled a transphobe.

1791
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,120
Any binary trans person who associates with me

1792
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
will be branded an NB-phobe.

1793
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,680
And any non-binary people who associate with me

1794
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,240
will be ostracized from their own community.

1795
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,440
So on the internet, I find myself increasingly alone.

1796
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,680
I'm isolated by the harassment.

1797
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,160
And that is ultimately the point.

1798
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,200
To exile me from my community, from any community.

1799
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,200
And it's all because I refuse to participate

1800
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,440
in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.

1801
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,000
My experiences have made me so disillusioned

1802
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,160
with the idea that social media call-outs

1803
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,080
can lead to any kind of justice,

1804
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,880
that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.

1805
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,000
There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics

1806
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,720
who I could absolutely hashtag me to,

1807
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,800
but I'm never gonna do it,

1808
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,800
because I have no faith left

1809
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,680
in the process of call-out vigilante justice.

1810
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,480
And I'm not saying I'm totally against me-to-ing people,

1811
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,000
because I think in some cases,

1812
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,720
it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.

1813
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,760
But in my case, I feel like I just know too much

1814
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,480
about the dark side of social media shaming

1815
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,800
to ever wanna participate in it again.

1816
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,320
You know, I feel like the story would end up

1817
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,240
being taken out of my control,

1818
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,280
warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.

1819
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,440
It would end up just haunting both me

1820
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,280
and the person I'd be accusing,

1821
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,280
which in this case, honestly, neither of us deserves.

1822
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,680
So I'm just not willing to take that risk,

1823
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,080
except maybe in some very extreme situation,

1824
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,760
which this just isn't.

1825
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,800
It's not worth it.

1826
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,520
And likewise, when a mob is at my doorstep

1827
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,360
demanding I condemn Buck Angel

1828
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,120
to save myself from cancellation,

1829
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:16,900
no!

1830
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,800
I'm just not gonna do that.

1831
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
I'm a conscientious objector.

1832
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,040
I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.

1833
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,320
Take me away, boys.

1834
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:27,940
Ugh.

1835
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,760
Ugh.

1836
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,620
If there's one thing I can't stand,

1837
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,220
it's Breadtube videos.

1838
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,060
Part eight and a half.

1839
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,940
The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.

1840
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,440
Ugh.

1841
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,260
I have done this to YouTube.

1842
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,580
And I'm sorry.

1843
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,780
So look, cancelling is not criticism.

1844
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,940
It is not holding someone accountable.

1845
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,420
It is an attack on a human being.

1846
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,660
In this video, I use the word canceling

1847
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,420
more or less synonymously

1848
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,100
with what feminist Jo Freeman,

1849
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,860
author of The Bitch Manifesto,

1850
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,380
calls trashing.

1851
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,460
And I've linked her essay Trashing,

1852
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,220
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

1853
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,260
and the description.

1854
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:12,100
It was originally published in Ms. Magazine in 1976,

1855
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,340
but it is a perfect description

1856
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,820
of what goes on on trans Twitter today.

1857
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:18,100
It is not disagreement.

1858
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,300
It is not conflict.

1859
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,060
It is not opposition.

1860
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,140
These are perfectly ordinary phenomena,

1861
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,980
which, when engaged in mutually,

1862
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,660
honestly, and not excessively,

1863
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,500
are necessary to keep an organism

1864
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,660
or organization healthy and active.

1865
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,620
Trashing is a particularly vicious

1866
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,300
form of character assassination

1867
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,300
which amounts to psychological rape.

1868
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,500
It is manipulative, dishonest, and excessive.

1869
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,260
It is occasionally disguised

1870
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,260
by the rhetoric of honest conflict

1871
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,700
or covered up by denying

1872
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,780
that any disapproval exists at all.

1873
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,340
But it is not done to expose disagreements

1874
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,700
or resolve differences.

1875
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,740
It is done to disparage and destroy.

1876
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,260
Whatever methods are used,

1877
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,060
trashing involves a violation of one's integrity,

1878
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,220
a declaration of one's worthlessness,

1879
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,300
and an impugning of one's motives.

1880
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,580
In effect, what is attacked is not one's actions

1881
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,140
or one's ideas, but one's self.

1882
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,340
And that's what distinguishes trashing,

1883
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,060
bullying, or abuse from criticism

1884
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,500
or holding accountable.

1885
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,380
Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.

1886
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,460
But when people are canceling me,

1887
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,780
they're not bringing up my problematic tweets

1888
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,260
because they want me to revise my beliefs.

1889
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:26,980
No.

1890
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,780
What they're doing is accumulating evidence

1891
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,820
to support the case they've decided to make

1892
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,340
that I am a horrible person who must be shunned.

1893
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,020
You know, the only sense in which I am,

1894
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,220
as they like to say,

1895
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,660
the new Blaire White,

1896
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,500
is that I think I actually have now

1897
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,060
snatched Vanessa's crown

1898
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,460
as the most hated tran on tran Twitter.

1899
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,420
Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.

1900
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,700
Feud with me, goddammit.

1901
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,380
You can't have a one-sided feud.

1902
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,220
I don't want to be one of those trans YouTubers

1903
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,220
that just drags other trans people all day

1904
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,500
and they never respond.

1905
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,020
That would be really pathetic.

1906
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,500
The new Laci Green, that's the other one.

1907
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,580
The newest in a series of women

1908
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,060
you've decided to treat like supervillains.

1909
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,460
Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?

1910
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,180
And supervillain is the right word.

1911
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,900
Like, I'm the bad guy, duh.

1912
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,580
I'm the enemy.

1913
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,820
And what do you do with the enemy?

1914
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,500
Well, you disavow, disown, deplatform, and destroy.

1915
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,020
As that one tweet put it,

1916
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,020
that's the line in the sand, folks.

1917
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,620
Where do you stand?

1918
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,300
If you adequately demonstrate

1919
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,700
your searing hatred of Natalie Wynn,

1920
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,540
then you're safe and cool.

1921
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,580
But if you don't,

1922
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,540
you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.

1923
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,340
And you too are now the enemy.

1924
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:43,060
Cancel culture trope seven, dualism.

1925
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,980
Certain ancient religions teach their followers

1926
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,580
to understand the cosmos

1927
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,820
as a struggle between light and dark,

1928
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,100
good and evil.

1929
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,620
And cancel culture does more or less the same thing.

1930
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,220
It's binary thinking.

1931
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:59,540
People are either good or they're bad.

1932
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,460
And to add to that, essentialism.

1933
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:04,260
If a person says or does a bad thing,

1934
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,300
we should interpret that as the mask slipping,

1935
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,500
as a momentary glimpse of their essential wickedness.

1936
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,420
And anyone who wants to remain good

1937
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,460
had better be willing to publicly condemn

1938
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,500
anyone the community has decided is bad.

1939
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,580
There really is something dystopian about this.

1940
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,540
You have to be willing to accuse other people

1941
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,300
to prove your own innocence.

1942
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,220
That's the line in the sand, folks.

1943
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:28,660
Where do you stand?

1944
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,500
In the most extreme version of this,

1945
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,820
all bad people are equally bad.

1946
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,500
So collaborating with truscum

1947
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,660
means you may as well be truscum.

1948
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,820
And of course, being truscum

1949
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:40,580
is tantamount to being a TERF.

1950
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,940
And on trans Twitter,

1951
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:46,020
it is a known fact that TERFs are Nazis.

1952
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,700
And this implies that Nazis, TERFs, truscum,

1953
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,620
people who associate with truscum,

1954
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,980
people who fail to condemn

1955
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,740
people who associate with truscum,

1956
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,420
people who offer emotional support

1957
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,780
to people who fail to condemn

1958
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,380
people who associate with truscum,

1959
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,580
all of them must be treated the same way.

1960
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:05,300
Deplatform her just like every other racist,

1961
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,860
sexist, bigoted content creator.

1962
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,420
A fully wound backhand to the mouth.

1963
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,660
I recently read a book by Sarah Shulman

1964
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,820
called Conflict is Not Abuse,

1965
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,380
Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility,

1966
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,900
and the Duty of Repair.

1967
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,420
Basically, Shulman's argument

1968
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,340
is that in various contexts,

1969
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,100
from romantic relationships,

1970
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,940
to community infighting,

1971
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,860
to international politics,

1972
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,700
the overstatement of harm

1973
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,660
is used as a justification for cruelty

1974
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,340
and for escalating conflict.

1975
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,700
So for example,

1976
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,700
and this is my example, not Shulman's,

1977
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,460
TERFs fixate on the exaggerated danger

1978
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:44,500
that trans women supposedly pose to cis women.

1979
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,980
And in very classic overstatement of harm,

1980
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,260
they'll describe everything they don't like as rape.

1981
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,140
Trans women entering women's spaces is rape.

1982
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,660
Trans women existing, Janice Raymond, is rape.

1983
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,500
And then they use that exaggerated harm

1984
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,100
as a justification to retaliate against them,

1985
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,340
to dox and harass and shun.

1986
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,940
Well, the same kind of logic

1987
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,940
is used to justify abusive behavior

1988
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,780
within the trans community.

1989
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,220
The dualistic thinking,

1990
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,420
the essentialism,

1991
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,940
the pseudo-moralism.

1992
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,940
All of this allows people on Twitter

1993
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,980
to treat me in an obviously abusive way,

1994
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,500
all the while feeling like they're doing the right thing,

1995
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,900
because they're attacking the enemy.

1996
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,180
And I realize that some people will say

1997
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,340
that I'm the one who's overstating harm

1998
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,700
to evade criticism.

1999
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,540
Well look, you've seen the tweets,

2000
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,020
the furious demands for me to be exiled,

2001
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,260
the doxing and threatening and ordering around

2002
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,220
of my colleagues,

2003
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,620
the attempts to isolate me from my community,

2004
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,140
the attacks not on my actions

2005
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,820
but on who I am as a person.

2006
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,300
There's not really anything ambiguous about this,

2007
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,580
it's just abuse.

2008
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,500
But I don't think it feels like abuse

2009
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,340
to the people who are doing it.

2010
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,980
They feel like they're punching up,

2011
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,900
because I'm a celebrity with a platform

2012
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,740
and lots of Twitter followers.

2013
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,900
And it's true that I do have more power

2014
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,060
than any of them individually.

2015
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,220
But as a collective,

2016
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,060
they have a terrifying power

2017
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,180
that they don't seem to be aware of as individuals.

2018
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,380
As John Ronson,

2019
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,940
author of a great book on public shaming put it,

2020
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,780
I suppose that when shamings are delivered

2021
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,020
like remotely administered drone strikes,

2022
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,100
nobody needs to think about how ferocious

2023
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,780
our collective power might be.

2024
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,660
The snowflake never needs to feel responsible

2025
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,780
for the avalanche.

2026
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,940
And that's how you get these situations

2027
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,700
where you have hundreds of people

2028
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,300
endlessly bashing someone

2029
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,540
who's already been knocked to the ground

2030
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,500
and feeling all the while like they're punching up.

2031
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,140
You know, there's actually a kind of power

2032
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,180
and safety in anonymity and obscurity.

2033
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,420
And there are many ways that being a public figure

2034
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,580
makes you really vulnerable.

2035
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,220
For example, you're more vulnerable to doxing,

2036
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,140
stalking, and harassment

2037
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:54,900
on a scale that most people probably can't even imagine.

2038
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,220
You're vulnerable to having your reputation

2039
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,060
permanently degraded

2040
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,940
in a way that people who are posting anonymously

2041
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,740
or pseudonymously are pretty much invulnerable to.

2042
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,060
And a lot of the people who are attacking me,

2043
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:09,220
they're not pausing to self-reflect.

2044
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:11,060
They're not holding themselves accountable

2045
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,140
for the consequences of their actions.

2046
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,020
They're just venting their unfiltered rage.

2047
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,700
But in response to these attacks,

2048
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,540
I, as a powerful person with a platform,

2049
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,340
I'm not allowed to react like a human being.

2050
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,020
I'm not allowed to get angry.

2051
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,620
I'm not allowed to show pain.

2052
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,220
I'm not allowed to get defensive.

2053
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,820
I'm not allowed to lash out.

2054
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,420
All I'm allowed to do is go totally numb on the inside

2055
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,500
as I try to frantically calculate

2056
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,140
the ideal public relations response

2057
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,860
that pays due deference to the valid concerns

2058
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,940
of these poor, marginalized people,

2059
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,620
all the while ignoring the tsunami of verbal abuse

2060
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,060
that's crashing over me.

2061
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,740
You know, people on Twitter,

2062
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:54,020
they don't try to persuade me like I'm a human being.

2063
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,540
They order me around.

2064
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,060
They tell me what to believe.

2065
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,140
They demand that I say exactly

2066
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,540
what they want me to say or else.

2067
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,460
It's extremely objectifying.

2068
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,140
They don't treat me like a person

2069
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,220
with my own opinions and feelings.

2070
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:11,380
They treat me as this like brand of moral commodity

2071
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,460
to be consumed or denounced.

2072
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,220
And this is all terribly ironic

2073
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,140
because of the conflicting demand

2074
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:20,580
that creators be authentic all the time.

2075
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,460
One thing that always frustrates me about these situations

2076
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,380
is there's this demand that you apologize instantly,

2077
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,660
and there's this perception that a fast apology

2078
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,820
is more sincere than a delayed one.

2079
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:35,060
But in fact, the opposite is true.

2080
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,820
It takes longer than a couple hours

2081
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:41,940
to cool down, lower your defenses, listen, learn, grow,

2082
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,820
seriously reflect on what you may have done

2083
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,020
or said that was wrong.

2084
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,700
That can take days or weeks or months.

2085
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,820
I had to do my October AMA stream for Patreon,

2086
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,740
and at the beginning of the stream,

2087
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:57,940
I gave my emotional half-formed reaction

2088
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,420
to the Buck Angel situation.

2089
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:06,580
And some traitor on my Patreon transcribed

2090
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,700
that part of the stream and disseminated it on Twitter

2091
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,860
just to instigate another round of canceling.

2092
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,900
You're not allowed a chance to think or feel.

2093
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,700
And because supposedly the best thing to do

2094
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,820
from a PR perspective is to apologize immediately,

2095
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,300
canceling produces a lot of insincere bullshit apologies

2096
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,180
from people who haven't in fact learned anything.

2097
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,420
And I think most people are aware of that.

2098
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,860
In fact, I think the demand for an apology itself

2099
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,300
is often insincere.

2100
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,260
If you're being canceled rather than criticized,

2101
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,380
then the line in the sand has been drawn.

2102
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,820
You and all your kin have been declared the enemy.

2103
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,900
Apologize to Twitter.

2104
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,860
At this point, I may as well apologize to 4chan.

2105
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:53,140
Dear 4chan, I am super fucking sorry

2106
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,860
I called you thin-wristed otaku shitweasels

2107
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,940
who like looking at pictures of little girls.

2108
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,860
I have been trying to educate myself

2109
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,300
and learn from my mistakes,

2110
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,340
and I now realize that's only 70% of you.

2111
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,380
Once you're canceled, you can really do no right.

2112
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:10,260
If you apologize, the apology will be declared

2113
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,580
a manipulative attempt to save face,

2114
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:15,380
and in fact it will be used as further evidence

2115
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:18,420
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

2116
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,580
If you try to explain or defend yourself,

2117
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,540
I mean first of all,

2118
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,940
you'll almost certainly dig yourself in deeper.

2119
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:26,420
But even if you're articulate and correct,

2120
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,220
you'll still be seen as unable to take criticism

2121
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,860
and as ignoring the hurt of marginalized people.

2122
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,460
And if you just go silent,

2123
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,500
you'll be seen as a coward fleeing accountability,

2124
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,500
even though there's lots of reasons

2125
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,020
why you might go silent.

2126
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,500
Maybe you're taking a few days away from social media

2127
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,820
to try to cool down and think clearly,

2128
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,620
or maybe you're so overwhelmed by the harassment

2129
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,900
that you've just shut down.

2130
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:56,340
Let's do shots.

2131
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,700
Who wants to do a shot with me?

2132
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,060
Do you want to do a shot with me?

2133
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,860
Let's do a shot.

2134
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,340
A tequila shot is my favorite.

2135
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:06,980
I like the whole salt tequila lime ritual.

2136
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,820
It's just very satisfying to me.

2137
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:11,380
It's the end of that bottle.

2138
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,580
Okay, let's get started.

2139
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,420
You feel warm right away,

2140
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:23,460
you know that feeling where it's like,

2141
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:28,100
oh, hey how are you happiness?

2142
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:28,740
Hey how are you?

2143
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,220
Feeling that life is worth living?

2144
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:32,020
It's a good moment.

2145
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,780
You're like, oh, this is okay.

2146
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:34,900
This is gonna be okay.

2147
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,020
I can get through this.

2148
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,060
That's how it starts.

2149
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:37,940
To watch out for that.

2150
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,180
So look, I really don't like to represent myself as a victim.

2151
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:46,020
That's not really a narrative that I identify with.

2152
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,660
But for the purposes of communicating

2153
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,180
what effect canceling has,

2154
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:54,740
I feel like I should say something about the pain.

2155
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:57,220
Much of the happiness that you might expect

2156
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,140
to come along with success

2157
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,460
has been taken away from me

2158
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,220
by this constant fury that surrounds me.

2159
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,220
Try to think about this rationally.

2160
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,980
I'm a Libra sun, Pisces moon.

2161
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,980
Being canceled is hell for me.

2162
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,780
You know, I want to be liked by everyone.

2163
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,060
And I'm starting to think

2164
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:18,900
I might be in the wrong career for that.

2165
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,180
In a way, leftist Twitter finally accomplished

2166
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,980
what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs

2167
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:28,180
have been trying and failing to do to me for years.

2168
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,940
They've made Twitter into a platform

2169
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,260
so hostile to my existence

2170
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,100
that I've decided to leave it forever.

2171
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,180
And they demoralized me to the point

2172
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:38,500
I could barely get out of bed for a month.

2173
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,420
And I know that sounds really melodramatic,

2174
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,060
but I'm just trying to be honest with you

2175
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:46,020
about what a melodramatic person I am.

2176
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,100
I find I have trouble convincing people

2177
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,460
of the severity of the pain that being canceled causes,

2178
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:54,180
because I think it's just hard to imagine

2179
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,860
if you haven't been through it yourself.

2180
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,740
And I don't know a more succinct way to convey it to you

2181
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,860
than by telling you that in the last few years

2182
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,820
I've been harassed by Nazis, I've been harassed by TERFs,

2183
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:07,940
I've been stalked, I've been doxxed, I've been threatened,

2184
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,540
I've been sexually assaulted.

2185
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,460
And the pain of being canceled,

2186
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,420
of being totally trashed by other trans people online

2187
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,620
for years has been more difficult for me to cope with

2188
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,220
than all the rest of it combined.

2189
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,060
Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel

2190
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,780
better than I think I can describe it myself.

2191
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,700
I was one of the first in the country,

2192
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,620
perhaps the first in Chicago,

2193
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,700
to have my character, my commitment,

2194
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,980
and my very self attacked in such a way by movement women

2195
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,060
that it left me torn in little pieces

2196
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,180
and unable to function.

2197
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,620
It took me years to recover,

2198
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,940
and even today the wounds have not entirely healed.

2199
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,420
This attack is accomplished by making you feel

2200
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,940
that your very existence is inimical to the movement,

2201
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:49,300
and that nothing can change this short of ceasing to exist.

2202
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,580
These feelings are reinforced

2203
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,740
when you are isolated from your friends.

2204
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,620
As they become convinced that their association with you

2205
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,820
is similarly inimical to the movement and to themselves,

2206
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,060
any support of you will taint them.

2207
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,140
Eventually all your colleagues join in

2208
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:06,340
in a chorus of condemnation which cannot be silenced,

2209
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,300
and you are reduced to a mere parody of your previous self.

2210
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:12,500
Yeah, that just about sums it up.

2211
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,220
Now as it happens, I am going to survive this

2212
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:19,220
because I have very deliberately built a support network

2213
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,500
that will be there for me

2214
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,700
regardless of what online trans communities say.

2215
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,700
And I have very deliberately done that

2216
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,740
because early in my transition back in 2017,

2217
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,620
I relied very heavily on the online leftist trans community

2218
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,460
for all kinds of emotional support.

2219
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,060
You know, when you're early in transition,

2220
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:38,980
I mean, it just sucks.

2221
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,620
You feel like the whole world is against you.

2222
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,700
And I talked about this a little bit in my last video,

2223
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,580
you know, feeling like a freak show walking down the street.

2224
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,460
And even if you're lucky enough to have a supportive family,

2225
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:52,740
it usually still is gonna take them a while to come around.

2226
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:54,020
At first they don't get it.

2227
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,380
They say things to you like,

2228
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,220
aren't you worried you'll regret this?

2229
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,540
And they struggle with your name and pronouns,

2230
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,900
which is understandable,

2231
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,180
but at the same time,

2232
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,220
it makes you feel like you're not being seen for who you are.

2233
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,540
So you need a kind of second family

2234
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,300
that understands how you're feeling

2235
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,460
and acts happy about your transition

2236
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,820
and validates your gender.

2237
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,300
And for the first couple months of my transition,

2238
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:19,300
I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.

2239
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,460
Well, that didn't last long because,

2240
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,940
well, I was, what, two months into my transition

2241
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,860
when first I did an interview

2242
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,620
with the journalist Jessie Single,

2243
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,580
and then I agreed to do a debate with Theron and Vanessa.

2244
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:31,540
So that's a long story,

2245
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,580
but in short, I associated with a string of people

2246
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,140
that trans Twitter considers the enemy.

2247
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:39,780
And trans Twitter tore me apart over this,

2248
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:41,460
and it completely broke my heart

2249
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,260
because I was really leaning

2250
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,580
on basically emotional support from strangers online,

2251
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,660
which seems really stupid in retrospect.

2252
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,100
And after they turned against me,

2253
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,300
I decided, one,

2254
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,700
that I was never going to rely on this group of people again,

2255
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,260
and two,

2256
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,140
that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.

2257
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:00,100
And in retrospect,

2258
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,860
I think this actually may have been good for me

2259
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,220
in a roundabout way

2260
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,300
because I was kicked out of the safe space,

2261
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,820
and I dropped that mentality.

2262
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:09,620
And so basically I was thrown into the deep end of reality

2263
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,220
and forced to sink or swim.

2264
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,620
And I don't know if my transition or my channel

2265
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,900
would be where they are today

2266
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,900
if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.

2267
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,100
Are we swimming through fire,

2268
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,700
or are we mixing metaphors?

2269
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,580
The point is,

2270
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,940
I'm more armored against canceling

2271
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,300
than I was two years ago.

2272
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,260
And the reason why

2273
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,940
is I have acquired a certain level of privilege and security

2274
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,860
and independence from any one community

2275
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,340
so that if one community cancels me,

2276
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,100
I still have somewhere else to go.

2277
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,780
You know, the people who are most vulnerable

2278
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:38,900
to cancel culture

2279
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,580
are not white guy comedians.

2280
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:41,780
They're not James Charles.

2281
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,740
They're not me.

2282
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,340
They are marginalized people

2283
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,180
who feel like they have nowhere else to go

2284
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:47,940
when they're rejected by their community.

2285
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,180
That means struggling trans people

2286
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,940
with a few hundred Twitter followers.

2287
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,700
It means a lot of sex workers.

2288
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,380
It means people who totally rely on activist circles

2289
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,380
for emotional and material support.

2290
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,380
I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.

2291
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,820
I had survived my youth

2292
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,900
because I had never given anyone or any group

2293
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,100
the right to judge me.

2294
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,340
That right I had reserved to myself.

2295
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,420
But the movement seduced me

2296
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,900
by its sweet promise of sisterhood.

2297
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,420
It claimed to provide a haven

2298
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,740
from the ravages of a sexist society,

2299
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,740
a place where one would be understood.

2300
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,540
It was my very need for feminism and feminists

2301
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,220
that made me vulnerable.

2302
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,860
I gave the movement the right to judge me

2303
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,060
because I trusted it.

2304
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,060
And when it judged me worthless,

2305
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,740
I accepted that judgment.

2306
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,980
There's a really irritating point

2307
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:35,540
that people on the left like to make that goes,

2308
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:38,020
well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.

2309
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,100
Canceled people usually get a new job

2310
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,300
or keep their platform,

2311
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,860
so I guess it's not really that bad, huh?

2312
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,300
I think people say this

2313
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,980
because they're trying to mitigate

2314
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,660
any sense of guilt they might feel

2315
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,100
about how they're treating people,

2316
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,940
because it's a really stupid argument.

2317
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,940
There's lots of things that don't end your life

2318
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,140
that are still terrible,

2319
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,660
but also there's cases

2320
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,900
where canceling has ended someone's life.

2321
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,900
On December 5th, 2017,

2322
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,060
a porn star named August Ames

2323
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,700
killed herself by hanging in a public park

2324
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,820
after being canceled on Twitter over a homophobic tweet.

2325
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,660
On December 3rd, she tweeted,

2326
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:13,140
whichever lady performer is replacing me tomorrow

2327
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:14,660
for Erotica X News,

2328
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,740
you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn

2329
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,780
just to let you know.

2330
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,700
BS is all I can say, shrug.

2331
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,100
Do agents really not care about who they're representing?

2332
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,660
LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.

2333
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,340
So I've never worked in porn,

2334
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,980
so I can't really tell you what the norms are

2335
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,340
around women working with men who have done gay porn.

2336
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:35,060
But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,

2337
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,580
and that seemed to be the consensus

2338
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,260
of other industry people on Twitter.

2339
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,780
So Twitter did its thing,

2340
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,180
people in August's community called her a homophobe

2341
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,220
and lashed out at her.

2342
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,740
And as always happens,

2343
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,420
plenty of passersby jumped in

2344
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,580
to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.

2345
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,620
Over the next few days,

2346
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,620
August tweeted several more times,

2347
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,780
going through the usual stages that you go through

2348
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,980
when you're being canceled.

2349
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,900
First, she defended herself.

2350
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,980
She claimed most other women in the industry

2351
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,100
feel the same as her.

2352
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,540
Then she said she's bisexual

2353
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,220
and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.

2354
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,140
Then she said, fine, I guess I'll be fake

2355
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,420
and not have opinions then.

2356
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:08,500
Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is,

2357
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,780
and she got really defensive

2358
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,100
about her right to choose who she has sex with.

2359
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,420
And she lashed out at the people attacking her.

2360
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,500
And then in her final tweet,

2361
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,420
she just said, fuck y'all,

2362
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:21,220
and went to the park that night and killed herself.

2363
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:22,900
This is all so familiar to me.

2364
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,980
I feel like I'm able to relive with her

2365
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,060
each stage of this emotional process.

2366
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,180
There's that first moment

2367
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,940
when you realize the outrage is beginning

2368
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:32,580
and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.

2369
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,140
And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.

2370
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,220
And then the bargaining, the fear,

2371
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,700
and finally the shame and the despair.

2372
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,820
And here's the thing,

2373
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:44,180
I totally agree with her critics that her tweet was bad.

2374
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,900
Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,

2375
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:50,580
but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.

2376
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:54,260
But she was still a person who deserves to live.

2377
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,780
And I think there's gotta be a better way

2378
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,460
to deal with these situations

2379
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:00,420
than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.

2380
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,860
And I know it's never as simple

2381
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,620
as Twitter made her kill herself.

2382
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,100
There's always other things going on in the background.

2383
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,780
But the point I'm making is,

2384
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,660
canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people

2385
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,060
because marginalized people generally

2386
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,460
have more things going on in the background.

2387
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,820
Jon Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death,

2388
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,940
and it goes into how she was sexually abused as a child,

2389
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:23,380
abandoned by her father.

2390
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,660
She was living with a boyfriend

2391
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,740
she was kind of emotionally detached from.

2392
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:27,780
And a few weeks earlier,

2393
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:29,060
she'd filmed a scene with a guy

2394
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:31,300
who was unnecessarily rough and mean

2395
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,660
and who mistreated her.

2396
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,660
So she was kind of traumatized by that.

2397
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,820
And so she was kind of on edge

2398
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,060
and really defensive about who she worked with

2399
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,020
when she was tweeting.

2400
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,460
Then the backlash happened.

2401
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:44,020
And since she had no other support network,

2402
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:47,220
she probably felt like the only community she had

2403
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,100
turned against her.

2404
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,580
And that's a really painful feeling.

2405
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,700
She must have felt so despised.

2406
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:56,740
Which is how I've felt for the last two months.

2407
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:00,340
I feel despised and burdensome.

2408
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:03,380
And I can imagine how a person who feels that way

2409
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:05,540
could have an impulsive couple hours

2410
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,860
where they think their best option is suicide.

2411
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,220
I mean, I can more than imagine it

2412
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,740
because I've been there myself.

2413
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:13,300
And I'm still here because at those moments,

2414
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,700
I've been with good friends who took care of me.

2415
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,660
And by friends, I do mean Xanax.

2416
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:21,700
But I've also survived

2417
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,540
because there's a lot of people on the internet

2418
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,780
who'd be very entertained if I killed myself

2419
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:28,820
and I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.

2420
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:29,860
Oh no, bitch.

2421
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,140
I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.

2422
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,740
I mean, who needs a guardian angel

2423
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:37,060
when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas

2424
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,220
on the fumes of total contempt?

2425
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,740
What I'm really trying to say is,

2426
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,700
Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.

2427
01:34:43,700 --> 01:35:06,660
Oh, holy night, the stars are bright.

2428
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:14,500
The shining meow, meow, meow, meow,

2429
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:19,780
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

2430
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,780
To get my lesbian pliers out again.

2431
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,700
Have a super fucking happy new year, bitch.

2432
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:34,340
How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?

2433
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,180
Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?

2434
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,020
Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.

2435
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,940
All right, I need to take a deep breath

2436
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,060
because let's be honest,

2437
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,140
I'm about one crack away from attacking

2438
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,220
my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.

2439
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:48,660
I am about one breakdown away from going on a rampage

2440
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,980
and making a suit out of women's skin.

2441
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,340
Just kidding, I would never do that.

2442
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,620
Though on a bad skin day,

2443
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,940
I've given it serious consideration.

2444
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:57,780
Oh, I'll be fine.

2445
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,140
I've gotta sober up anyway

2446
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,700
because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.

2447
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:02,820
And plastic surgery,

2448
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,220
that's about the only thing holding me together

2449
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:05,940
at this point.

2450
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,340
YouTubing, this is a healthy profession.

2451
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:11,460
This is great.

2452
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,660
Anyone want my job?

2453
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,420
Step right up.

2454
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,020
All you have to do is make informative

2455
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:16,980
and entertaining videos

2456
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:18,980
about extremely controversial topics

2457
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,540
while of course representing the full range of experiences

2458
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,100
in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum

2459
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,420
and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.

2460
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,140
Well, go on.

2461
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,300
I'm waiting to be entertained.

2462
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,180
Feed me, mother.

2463
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,220
Oh, don't mind me.

2464
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:34,420
I'll just sit back and pour another glass of wine.

2465
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:37,540
Oh, and I will of course be obsessively scrutinizing

2466
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:40,580
every word you say for any hint of moral transgression

2467
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,940
as well as critiquing your look,

2468
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,620
you third-rate cross-dresser.

2469
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,900
Zero out of 10.

2470
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,020
Get off my stage.

2471
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:47,940
You successfully spilled that everywhere.

2472
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:48,440
That's good.

2473
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,700
I do still want to talk about why people cancel

2474
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,060
and the effect that it's having,

2475
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,260
but it looks like there's gonna have to be a part two gorge

2476
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,700
because I have hit my limit.

2477
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,620
So why don't we all cut our losses

2478
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,860
and try again in 2020, hmm?

2479
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,220
I realize that people on Twitter

2480
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,060
aren't actually gonna watch this video,

2481
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,740
they're just gonna make fun of the title

2482
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:07,940
and how long it is,

2483
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,300
which fair enough,

2484
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,380
but they're the ones whose accusations against me

2485
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,140
are so numerous and convoluted

2486
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:15,700
it required a feature-length film to respond to.

2487
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,060
But yeah, they're gonna see the title

2488
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,700
and they're gonna transcribe quotes out of context

2489
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,380
and they're gonna say I'm a fascist,

2490
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,180
I'm a TERF,

2491
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,060
I'm true scum,

2492
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,180
I'm the new Blaire White,

2493
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:25,380
I'm the new Lacey Green,

2494
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,820
I'm a cis bootlicker,

2495
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,340
I'm an enlightened centrist,

2496
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:29,380
I'm a shitlib,

2497
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,740
I'm a heartless grifter raking in millions of dollars

2498
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,580
over the bodies of dead trans women.

2499
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:36,500
Mask off, yikes.

2500
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,780
This ain't it, chief.

2501
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,500
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

2502
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,820
Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?

2503
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:43,860
Disappointing.

2504
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,540
But they're saying all those things already

2505
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:46,740
so I'm inoculated.

2506
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:49,460
See their mistake was completely breaking my spirit,

2507
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,620
they should have left a little piece intact.

2508
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,380
But it's good, it's good, it's good,

2509
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:57,540
because basically my survival from here on out

2510
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:01,140
hinges on my ability to not care at all

2511
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,900
what people say about me online.

2512
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:04,260
So.

2513
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,060
Here's to not giving a fuck.

2514
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:16,340
This is almost a Norma Desmond cosplay,

2515
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:19,860
which is good because I'm not gonna age gracefully

2516
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:22,740
and it's the best to get into character now.

2517
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:26,580
YouTube stars never die.
