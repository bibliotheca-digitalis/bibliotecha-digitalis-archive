0	9440	Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine.
9440	12440	Apparently the world is ending.
12440	15440	But where is he?
15440	19440	Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up!
19440	22440	Ugh, I'll get it myself.
30000	49000	Antoine?
49000	50000	There you are.
50000	53000	Ugh, it's this nerd again.
53000	59000	Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts please?
59000	60000	I'll think about it.
60000	62000	Have you watched my video yet?
62000	64000	The one about the apocalypse?
64000	66000	No Marie, it's not about the apocalypse.
66000	68000	It's about how to stop climate change.
68000	71000	You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube
71000	75000	where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.
75000	76000	Well I can't stand that.
76000	79000	Well why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.
79000	81000	This is extortion.
81000	84000	You're sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.
84000	85000	My god.
85000	87000	You cucks will stop at nothing.
87000	89000	That's right, open wide.
89000	90000	No.
90000	91000	No.
91000	92000	No.
96000	97000	Welcome to the lab.
97000	100000	The lab of aesthetic climatology.
100000	103000	Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?
103000	107000	Imagine that this is the Earth.
107000	110000	This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.
110000	115000	In 1976, a beta cock named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.
115000	119000	For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness
119000	121000	about the grave predictions of climate science,
121000	126000	in particular the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
126000	132000	Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
132000	136000	But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park
136000	140000	ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation
140000	143000	about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.
143000	148000	He is half man, half bear, and half pig.
148000	152000	The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic, attention-seeking alarmist,
152000	156000	an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.
156000	158000	I'm super serial, you guys.
161000	164000	We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.
164000	172000	After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.
172000	177000	In fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.
177000	182000	A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay
182000	185000	Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.
185000	189000	Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.
189000	190000	It works like this.
190000	193000	You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hall
193000	197000	when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.
197000	200000	Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan
200000	202000	because even if they're not really judging you,
202000	208000	the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat.
208000	212000	And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.
212000	215000	So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,
215000	217000	Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?
217000	222000	Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution
222000	226000	and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.
226000	229000	And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway because more animals die
229000	233000	when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.
233000	236000	Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.
236000	240000	This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,
240000	243000	from the potential accusation that you're a bad person.
243000	248000	And you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.
248000	252000	And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.
252000	255000	He's a fun-ruiner, criticizing our high-emission way of life.
255000	258000	And instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,
258000	261000	we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.
261000	265000	The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real.
265000	267000	And Gore was right all along.
267000	270000	Oopsie doopsie!
270000	273000	So now it's current year and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius
273000	278000	above the pre-industrial average, which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.
278000	281000	Now one degree doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,
281000	287000	consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm.
287000	290000	We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average,
290000	295000	and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century,
295000	300000	an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.
300000	303000	Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees
303000	305000	in order to avert global cataclysm.
305000	308000	But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
309000	314000	warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,
314000	316000	the destruction of nearly every coral reef,
316000	321000	and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.
321000	324000	The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees,
324000	329000	a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,
329000	332000	and net zero emissions by 2050.
332000	336000	But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions.
336000	341000	Otherwise, we're on track for three degrees of warming, and possibly even four or more,
341000	344000	a situation that could be near-apocalyptic.
345000	349000	Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.
349000	351000	Weather changes sometimes.
351000	353000	You were just talking about the Ice Age.
353000	355000	First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.
355000	356000	That's just nature.
356000	360000	Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists
360000	365000	just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?
365000	368000	Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions
368000	370000	is just an attack on the American way of life,
370000	374000	another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?
374000	376000	What freedom? Are you an oil company?
376000	378000	Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?
378000	380000	Isn't that what you liberals think?
380000	381000	My identity is valid.
381000	382000	No it isn't.
382000	384000	Bring me my smelling salts.
384000	386000	Watch the goddamn video.
389000	391000	Imagine the year is 2100.
391000	394000	I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,
394000	396000	and imagine you're a gynecologist,
396000	400000	and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.
400000	402000	How does that make you feel, kids?
402000	405000	I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents
405000	407000	had done something to stop this.
407000	410000	So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,
410000	413000	but at least our political leaders are responsible,
413000	416000	rational, and scientifically literate, right?
416000	418000	Is there climate change, yeah?
418000	421000	Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back?
421000	423000	Probably, that's what I think.
423000	424000	What if it goes this way?
424000	427000	Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,
427000	430000	from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax
430000	432000	aimed at undermining American manufacturing,
432000	435000	to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,
435000	438000	therefore whatever happened to global warming?
438000	440000	Of course, the term global warming refers to the increase
440000	442000	in the global average temperature,
442000	444000	temperature continuing to vary by region.
444000	447000	In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,
447000	451000	for instance if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,
451000	455000	chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.
455000	457000	But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.
457000	460000	He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know,
460000	463000	a real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary
463000	468000	and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual or scientific or true
468000	473000	or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible.
473000	476000	He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,
476000	478000	on some sub-rational, erotic level,
478000	481000	to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.
481000	484000	Burn the scholars! Build the wall!
484000	488000	But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy civilization's plunge
488000	490000	into primeval darkness,
490000	493000	is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy
493000	497000	about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.
497000	500000	A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change
500000	503000	found that 97% of papers published on the subject
503000	506000	supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming
506000	508000	and the consensus has only increased over time.
508000	511000	Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe
511000	513000	but is very common in America,
513000	518000	largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation
518000	520000	that goes back to the early 1990s,
520000	524000	when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to
524000	527000	quote, reposition global warming as theory, not fact,
527000	530000	and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way
530000	533000	to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.
534000	538000	Climate denialists' talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,
538000	542000	have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,
542000	545000	and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,
545000	548000	perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe,
548000	551000	whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies
551000	554000	and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments
554000	556000	as throwing a snowball to own the libs.
556000	559000	So here, Mr. President, catch this.
559000	563000	Denialists' talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords
563000	565000	to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,
565000	568000	where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.
568000	572000	Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information,
572000	576000	climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.
576000	579000	Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,
579000	584000	has received thousands of hate messages, death threats, even white powder in the mail.
584000	587000	The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering
587000	591000	as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,
591000	594000	and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.
594000	596000	It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,
596000	600000	and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource
600000	603000	listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as
603000	606000	there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,
606000	609000	there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,
609000	611000	it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,
611000	614000	and science is a liar sometimes.
614000	616000	But even if you don't believe in science,
616000	619000	maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,
619000	622000	including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real
622000	624000	and caused by human activity.
624000	626000	In fact, at the behest of oil companies,
626000	630000	the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds
630000	633000	to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,
633000	638000	largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides and more severe tropical storms.
638000	643000	After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion to quote
643000	647000	future-proof the state, despite the fact that many of its top politicians
647000	649000	are public climate change deniers.
649000	652000	You remember how it used to be called global warming?
652000	654000	And then magically the theory changed to climate change?
654000	655000	Sure.
655000	656000	The reason is it wasn't warming.
656000	660000	Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.
660000	664000	The science is clear. Climate change is real, and humans are causing it.
664000	667000	If even ExxonMobil says it's real, it's probably real.
667000	671000	There's really no point in digging in your heels and refusing to look at the evidence
671000	673000	just because you don't want it to be true.
673000	675000	None of us want it to be true.
676000	678000	Okay, fine.
678000	681000	So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.
681000	684000	And maybe humans have something to do with it.
684000	686000	Now can you give me my smelling salts?
686000	687000	Fine.
689000	692000	Look, Doc, I gotta say, maybe the scientists are right.
692000	694000	Maybe it is happening.
694000	698000	But to be honest with you, I'm having a hard time caring about this.
698000	699000	Like, at all.
699000	700000	At all?
700000	701000	How can you not care about this?
701000	703000	We're talking about the future of the planet.
703000	706000	Well, I don't care about the planet. I care about me.
706000	707000	Well, don't you live on the planet?
707000	708000	Mm-hmm.
708000	711000	And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?
712000	713000	No.
713000	714000	Goddammit.
714000	715000	Watch the video.
719000	724000	If you picture the Earth as a watermelon, you can see there's the outer shell here that traps the red flesh.
724000	727000	And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers...
727000	729000	The stalkers come for the red flesh.
729000	734000	Before describing the details of our doom, let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.
734000	738000	The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896
738000	743000	when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius published a study titled
743000	747000	On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Earth,
747000	752000	in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.
752000	758000	By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was in fact rising,
758000	766000	and President Bucking Johnson's Science Advisory Committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect.
766000	771000	The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968
771000	775000	that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels.
775000	778000	But nothing was really done about it until 1988,
778000	784000	when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,
784000	788000	that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty,
788000	791000	and that the warming was worsening heat waves, storms, and droughts.
791000	797000	That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change
797000	799000	and its political and economic impacts.
799000	802000	So it started to seem like something was going to change.
802000	808000	But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry was up and running in the United States,
808000	813000	despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades,
813000	818000	and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called skeptic cause.
818000	821000	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol,
821000	824000	pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
824000	827000	a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.
827000	831000	The 2012 Republican platform stated against all scientific consensus that,
838000	842000	Then, finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better.
842000	847000	195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama,
847000	849000	became parties to the Paris Agreement,
849000	854000	which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
854000	859000	For the very next year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States
859000	861000	on a platform of outright climate science denial.
861000	865000	Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement,
865000	868000	appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
868000	874000	and released his America First Energy Plan, which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.
874000	880000	So it's with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the grim 2018 IPCC report,
880000	884000	which informs us that the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,
884000	887000	resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,
887000	890000	increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events,
890000	894000	and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika.
894000	899000	If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,
899000	901000	and to net zero carbon by 2050,
901000	906000	global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,
906000	910000	resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought,
910000	915000	and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise.
915000	917000	But with the current political situation,
917000	921000	the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach.
921000	925000	By the end of this century, we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,
925000	930000	which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions.
930000	933000	3 degrees of warming will flood many of the world's major coastal cities,
933000	938000	including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong.
938000	941000	4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference between
941000	944000	early 20th century temperatures and the last Ice Age.
944000	948000	A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas
948000	951000	will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity,
951000	957000	trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.
957000	959000	So it's not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs.
959000	962000	There are real human consequences to this.
962000	965000	See, this is why you should care.
965000	966000	It's not just about the planet.
966000	969000	It's about the millions of people who are going to die or lose their homes.
969000	975000	Oh, jeez, wow, that's, gosh, that's really just too bad.
975000	977000	What kind of response is that?
977000	981000	Look, doc, people die all the time.
981000	983000	What am I supposed to do, cry about it?
983000	985000	No, you're supposed to take political action.
985000	990000	Yeah, I guess I could do that.
990000	995000	But this bath is very relaxing.
995000	998000	Well, look, even if you only care about yourself,
998000	1000000	you do realize that when the coastal cities flood,
1000000	1003000	we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?
1003000	1005000	Are you going to be okay with that?
1005000	1006000	No.
1006000	1009000	Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.
1009000	1010000	No.
1010000	1012000	Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.
1012000	1013000	No.
1013000	1016000	You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,
1016000	1018000	everyone is going to look back on people like you,
1018000	1020000	and they're going to hate you so much
1020000	1022000	for what you allowed to happen to this planet.
1022000	1024000	Well, those are future people.
1024000	1025000	I am alive now.
1025000	1027000	And besides, if what you're saying is true,
1027000	1029000	then this is basically the apocalypse anyway,
1029000	1032000	so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right?
1032000	1034000	But it's not the apocalypse, though.
1034000	1037000	Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism,
1037000	1040000	because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem.
1040000	1044000	Please, God, please, just try to focus on solving the problem
1044000	1045000	while we still have time.
1045000	1047000	So you're saying the world is ending.
1047000	1048000	The world is ending.
1048000	1049000	Cheers to that.
1049000	1051000	The world is not ending.
1051000	1052000	It's just getting shittier.
1052000	1054000	Well, what am I supposed to do about it?
1054000	1056000	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
1056000	1057000	All right.
1057000	1059000	Let me just re-up here.
1069000	1071000	All right, doc.
1071000	1072000	Put it in me.
1072000	1073000	You are repulsive.
1073000	1076000	Well, I'm so sorry you're offended by pleasure.
1076000	1078000	I'm not offended by what?
1078000	1079000	This offends you, doesn't it?
1079000	1081000	Are you triggered, liberal?
1081000	1082000	Are you triggered?
1082000	1083000	No, I'm not.
1083000	1084000	I'm not triggered.
1084000	1085000	Stop trying to pretend you're not owned.
1085000	1088000	You know, you really shouldn't be supporting the dairy industry.
1088000	1090000	They cause massive carbon emissions.
1090000	1096000	Well, maybe you shouldn't be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite.
1096000	1097000	What?
1097000	1099000	It's soy milk anyway, science nerd.
1099000	1102000	How do you think I got cell feminine?
1102000	1103000	There's nothing in science to support that.
1103000	1105000	Just admit that you're offended.
1105000	1107000	Please just watch the video.
1114000	1118000	When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon,
1118000	1120000	and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder,
1120000	1122000	where did they all come from, you know?
1122000	1123000	What does this all mean?
1123000	1124000	The cosmos?
1124000	1125000	Humanity?
1125000	1127000	Our little time here on Earth?
1127000	1129000	And that's why I became a scientist,
1129000	1132000	so I can spend my life studying
1134000	1136000	topospheric trace gases.
1144000	1146000	If you want to do your part to stop climate change,
1146000	1148000	there are some lifestyle changes you can make.
1148000	1150000	You can use LED light bulbs.
1150000	1152000	You can drive a hybrid or electric car.
1152000	1154000	You can use public transportation.
1154000	1156000	You can try not to fly very often.
1156000	1158000	You can eat less red meat.
1158000	1160000	The reality is, just 100 companies
1160000	1163000	are responsible for 71% of global emissions,
1163000	1165000	and the burden of stopping this
1165000	1167000	can't really be placed on individual consumers.
1167000	1170000	The companies themselves do not care.
1170000	1171000	Left to their own devices,
1171000	1173000	they will only pursue short-term profit.
1173000	1175000	They will ask the government to build them seawalls
1175000	1177000	while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.
1177000	1180000	Climate change is exactly the kind of problem
1180000	1183000	that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.
1183000	1185000	The timeframe involved is short enough
1185000	1187000	that scientists can predict total catastrophe
1187000	1189000	in the foreseeable future,
1189000	1191000	but just long enough not to enter into
1191000	1194000	the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.
1194000	1196000	So unless there's a drastic change
1196000	1197000	in the next couple decades,
1197000	1199000	this is going to be capitalism's
1199000	1201000	Great Chinese Famine moment,
1201000	1203000	only potentially it'll be much, much worse.
1203000	1205000	This is probably the most important issue
1205000	1207000	facing humanity in the 21st century,
1207000	1210000	so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,
1210000	1212000	beginning with rapid political change.
1212000	1214000	If that means direct action,
1214000	1215000	it means direct action,
1215000	1217000	for instance, organizing, participating in,
1217000	1220000	or supporting a massive general strike.
1220000	1222000	You also should demand that your politicians
1222000	1224000	take a strong stance against climate change
1224000	1226000	and the companies that cause it.
1226000	1227000	And if you're American,
1227000	1229000	vote this monumental ding-dong
1229000	1231000	out of the Oval Office in 2020
1231000	1234000	before the entire planet shrinks and transforms
1234000	1235000	into a corncob.
1240000	1241000	So let me get this straight.
1241000	1242000	You want me to go vegan,
1242000	1244000	drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.
1244000	1245000	You're basically asking me
1245000	1247000	to completely change who I am as a person
1247000	1249000	and become everything I hate.
1249000	1250000	Yeah, pretty much.
1250000	1252000	But it's not about what I want.
1252000	1254000	It's about what everyone has to do
1254000	1256000	to preserve the survival of humanity.
1256000	1260000	Well, electric cars, veganism.
1260000	1262000	Who could even afford that shit?
1262000	1264000	Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne.
1264000	1267000	I shall do no such thing.
1267000	1269000	Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.
1269000	1273000	I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.
1273000	1275000	You know, eating plant-based meals
1275000	1277000	actually costs less than eating meat.
1277000	1280000	Oh, okay, so just never again
1280000	1283000	enjoy the morning aroma of bacon
1283000	1285000	sizzling on the skillet,
1285000	1286000	barbecued ribs,
1286000	1287000	fried chicken,
1287000	1288000	corn dogs,
1288000	1290000	spicy pork belly,
1290000	1291000	lamb chops,
1291000	1293000	bloody steaks.
1293000	1294000	Ew.
1294000	1295000	Why do you want to eat
1295000	1297000	all that murdered animal flesh anyway
1297000	1300000	when you could eat pure, clean, natural foods
1300000	1303000	like lentils, barley, and sprouts?
1303000	1306000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1306000	1308000	I'd rather eat human shit.
1308000	1309000	Well, that's what you're gonna be eating
1309000	1311000	if the planet heats another few degrees.
1311000	1313000	How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels
1313000	1315000	when there's Muslims out there?
1315000	1316000	And Mexicans.
1316000	1318000	There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.
1318000	1321000	Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you
1321000	1323000	when all the climate science in the world
1323000	1325000	just bounces off that thick skull of yours?
1325000	1327000	Well, you people think everything is racist,
1327000	1329000	and second,
1329000	1332000	I guess I just need a villain, you know?
1332000	1333000	Who's the bad guy?
1333000	1334000	Who am I afraid of?
1334000	1335000	What's the other team?
1335000	1337000	Your climate story has no antagonist.
1337000	1339000	Is that really what it's gonna take?
1339000	1340000	All right, then.
1340000	1342000	Why don't you take a long, hard look
1342000	1343000	out at the sea?
1343000	1344000	Hi, Mama.
1344000	1346000	That's right, there she is.
1346000	1348000	Now look right over there.
1351000	1353000	Hello, mankind.
1353000	1356000	It is I, your dark mother, the sea.
1356000	1358000	And you, my children,
1358000	1360000	have been an absolute disappointment.
1360000	1362000	Every one of you is so pathetic,
1362000	1364000	you make me want to throw up.
1364000	1366000	Politicians, businessmen,
1366000	1369000	and worst of all, environmentalists.
1369000	1370000	Ugh.
1370000	1372000	The condescension of it all.
1372000	1375000	You think you are capable of hurting me?
1375000	1376000	Huh.
1376000	1378000	I enjoy your so-called degradation.
1378000	1380000	Your filthy air makes me hot.
1380000	1383000	Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside.
1383000	1385000	And when you spew your filth all over,
1385000	1388000	oh, it only makes me fucking wet.
1388000	1391000	Every year, my heaving bosom
1391000	1393000	encroaches farther on your shores.
1393000	1395000	And as I spat you out, my children,
1395000	1398000	I will swallow you whole.
1398000	1400000	I will take every inch of you inside me,
1400000	1402000	and I will suck you down
1402000	1404000	into the deep black pit of my wetness,
1404000	1405000	you scum.
1405000	1406000	And why?
1406000	1409000	Because I am a slut.
1409000	1411000	My progeny encompass the earth,
1411000	1413000	and whatsoever I create,
1413000	1415000	I shall destroy.
1415000	1417000	For I, your deep dark mother,
1417000	1420000	am at once deliverous of your doom.
1420000	1423000	And that's why I vote Republican.
1423000	1427000	Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1432000	1434000	You see that?
1434000	1436000	We've got 20 years to stop her,
1436000	1438000	or we're fucked.
1439000	1441000	Grrrr.
1447000	1450000	I cannot take you,
1450000	1454000	and when you put your name in June,
1454000	1458000	my feelings start to quiver like
1458000	1462000	fungs smelling your ragweed.
1462000	1466000	Who am I to participate,
1467000	1471000	and when you put your name in June,
1471000	1475000	my feelings start to quiver like
1475000	1479000	fungs smelling your ragweed.
