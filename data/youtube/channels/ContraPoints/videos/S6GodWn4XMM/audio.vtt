WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.440
Apparently the world is ending.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.440
But where is he?

00:15.440 --> 00:19.440
Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up!

00:19.440 --> 00:22.440
Ugh, I'll get it myself.

00:30.000 --> 00:49.000
Antoine?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
There you are.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Ugh, it's this nerd again.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts please?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll think about it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Have you watched my video yet?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
The one about the apocalypse?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No Marie, it's not about the apocalypse.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
It's about how to stop climate change.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Well I can't stand that.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Well why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
This is extortion.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
You're sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
My god.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You cucks will stop at nothing.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That's right, open wide.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
No.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
No.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Welcome to the lab.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
The lab of aesthetic climatology.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Imagine that this is the Earth.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
In 1976, a beta cock named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
about the grave predictions of climate science,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
in particular the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
He is half man, half bear, and half pig.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic, attention-seeking alarmist,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm super serial, you guys.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
In fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It works like this.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hall

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
because even if they're not really judging you,

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway because more animals die

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
from the potential accusation that you're a bad person.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
He's a fun-ruiner, criticizing our high-emission way of life.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
And Gore was right all along.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Oopsie doopsie!

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
So now it's current year and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
above the pre-industrial average, which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Now one degree doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average,

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century,

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
in order to avert global cataclysm.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
the destruction of nearly every coral reef,

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
and net zero emissions by 2050.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Otherwise, we're on track for three degrees of warming, and possibly even four or more,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
a situation that could be near-apocalyptic.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Weather changes sometimes.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You were just talking about the Ice Age.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's just nature.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
is just an attack on the American way of life,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What freedom? Are you an oil company?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Isn't that what you liberals think?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
My identity is valid.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
No it isn't.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Bring me my smelling salts.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Watch the goddamn video.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Imagine the year is 2100.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
and imagine you're a gynecologist,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
How does that make you feel, kids?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
had done something to stop this.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
but at least our political leaders are responsible,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
rational, and scientifically literate, right?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Is there climate change, yeah?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Probably, that's what I think.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
What if it goes this way?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
aimed at undermining American manufacturing,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
therefore whatever happened to global warming?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Of course, the term global warming refers to the increase

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
in the global average temperature,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
temperature continuing to vary by region.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
for instance if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
a real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual or scientific or true

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
on some sub-rational, erotic level,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Burn the scholars! Build the wall!

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy civilization's plunge

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
into primeval darkness,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
found that 97% of papers published on the subject

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and the consensus has only increased over time.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
but is very common in America,

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
that goes back to the early 1990s,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
quote, reposition global warming as theory, not fact,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Climate denialists' talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
as throwing a snowball to own the libs.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So here, Mr. President, catch this.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Denialists' talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
has received thousands of hate messages, death threats, even white powder in the mail.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
and science is a liar sometimes.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But even if you don't believe in science,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
and caused by human activity.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
In fact, at the behest of oil companies,

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides and more severe tropical storms.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion to quote

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
future-proof the state, despite the fact that many of its top politicians

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
are public climate change deniers.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
You remember how it used to be called global warming?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And then magically the theory changed to climate change?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Sure.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
The reason is it wasn't warming.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
The science is clear. Climate change is real, and humans are causing it.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
If even ExxonMobil says it's real, it's probably real.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
There's really no point in digging in your heels and refusing to look at the evidence

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
just because you don't want it to be true.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
None of us want it to be true.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Okay, fine.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And maybe humans have something to do with it.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Now can you give me my smelling salts?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Fine.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Look, Doc, I gotta say, maybe the scientists are right.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Maybe it is happening.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
But to be honest with you, I'm having a hard time caring about this.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Like, at all.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
At all?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
How can you not care about this?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
We're talking about the future of the planet.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, I don't care about the planet. I care about me.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, don't you live on the planet?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Mm-hmm.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Goddammit.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Watch the video.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
If you picture the Earth as a watermelon, you can see there's the outer shell here that traps the red flesh.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
The stalkers come for the red flesh.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Before describing the details of our doom, let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius published a study titled

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Earth,

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was in fact rising,

12:38.000 --> 12:46.000
and President Bucking Johnson's Science Advisory Committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
But nothing was really done about it until 1988,

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
and that the warming was worsening heat waves, storms, and droughts.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
and its political and economic impacts.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So it started to seem like something was going to change.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry was up and running in the United States,

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called skeptic cause.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
The 2012 Republican platform stated against all scientific consensus that,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Then, finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
became parties to the Paris Agreement,

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
For the very next year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
on a platform of outright climate science denial.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
and released his America First Energy Plan, which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.000
So it's with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the grim 2018 IPCC report,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
which informs us that the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and to net zero carbon by 2050,

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
But with the current political situation,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
By the end of this century, we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
3 degrees of warming will flood many of the world's major coastal cities,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference between

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
early 20th century temperatures and the last Ice Age.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity,

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So it's not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
There are real human consequences to this.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
See, this is why you should care.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It's not just about the planet.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
It's about the millions of people who are going to die or lose their homes.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh, jeez, wow, that's, gosh, that's really just too bad.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What kind of response is that?

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Look, doc, people die all the time.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
What am I supposed to do, cry about it?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
No, you're supposed to take political action.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
But this bath is very relaxing.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, look, even if you only care about yourself,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
you do realize that when the coastal cities flood,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Are you going to be okay with that?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
No.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
No.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
No.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
everyone is going to look back on people like you,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and they're going to hate you so much

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
for what you allowed to happen to this planet.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Well, those are future people.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I am alive now.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And besides, if what you're saying is true,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
then this is basically the apocalypse anyway,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
But it's not the apocalypse, though.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Please, God, please, just try to focus on solving the problem

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
while we still have time.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
So you're saying the world is ending.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
The world is ending.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Cheers to that.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
The world is not ending.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
It's just getting shittier.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
All right.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Let me just re-up here.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
All right, doc.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Put it in me.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
You are repulsive.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Well, I'm so sorry you're offended by pleasure.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm not offended by what?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
This offends you, doesn't it?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Are you triggered, liberal?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Are you triggered?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
No, I'm not.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I'm not triggered.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Stop trying to pretend you're not owned.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
You know, you really shouldn't be supporting the dairy industry.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
They cause massive carbon emissions.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
Well, maybe you shouldn't be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
What?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It's soy milk anyway, science nerd.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
How do you think I got cell feminine?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
There's nothing in science to support that.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Just admit that you're offended.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Please just watch the video.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
where did they all come from, you know?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
What does this all mean?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
The cosmos?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Humanity?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Our little time here on Earth?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
And that's why I became a scientist,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
so I can spend my life studying

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
topospheric trace gases.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
If you want to do your part to stop climate change,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
there are some lifestyle changes you can make.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You can use LED light bulbs.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You can drive a hybrid or electric car.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You can use public transportation.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
You can try not to fly very often.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You can eat less red meat.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
The reality is, just 100 companies

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
are responsible for 71% of global emissions,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
and the burden of stopping this

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
can't really be placed on individual consumers.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
The companies themselves do not care.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Left to their own devices,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
they will only pursue short-term profit.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
They will ask the government to build them seawalls

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Climate change is exactly the kind of problem

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The timeframe involved is short enough

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
that scientists can predict total catastrophe

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
in the foreseeable future,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
but just long enough not to enter into

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
So unless there's a drastic change

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
in the next couple decades,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
this is going to be capitalism's

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Great Chinese Famine moment,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
only potentially it'll be much, much worse.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
This is probably the most important issue

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
facing humanity in the 21st century,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
beginning with rapid political change.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
If that means direct action,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
it means direct action,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
for instance, organizing, participating in,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
or supporting a massive general strike.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
You also should demand that your politicians

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
take a strong stance against climate change

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
and the companies that cause it.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
And if you're American,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
vote this monumental ding-dong

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
out of the Oval Office in 2020

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
before the entire planet shrinks and transforms

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
into a corncob.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
So let me get this straight.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
You want me to go vegan,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
You're basically asking me

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
to completely change who I am as a person

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and become everything I hate.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah, pretty much.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But it's not about what I want.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It's about what everyone has to do

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
to preserve the survival of humanity.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, electric cars, veganism.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Who could even afford that shit?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I shall do no such thing.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
You know, eating plant-based meals

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
actually costs less than eating meat.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, okay, so just never again

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
enjoy the morning aroma of bacon

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
sizzling on the skillet,

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
barbecued ribs,

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
fried chicken,

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
corn dogs,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
spicy pork belly,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
lamb chops,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
bloody steaks.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Ew.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Why do you want to eat

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
all that murdered animal flesh anyway

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
when you could eat pure, clean, natural foods

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
like lentils, barley, and sprouts?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
I'd rather eat human shit.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Well, that's what you're gonna be eating

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
if the planet heats another few degrees.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
when there's Muslims out there?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
And Mexicans.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
when all the climate science in the world

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
just bounces off that thick skull of yours?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Well, you people think everything is racist,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
and second,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
I guess I just need a villain, you know?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Who's the bad guy?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Who am I afraid of?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
What's the other team?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Your climate story has no antagonist.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Is that really what it's gonna take?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
All right, then.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Why don't you take a long, hard look

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
out at the sea?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Hi, Mama.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
That's right, there she is.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Now look right over there.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Hello, mankind.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It is I, your dark mother, the sea.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And you, my children,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
have been an absolute disappointment.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Every one of you is so pathetic,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
you make me want to throw up.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Politicians, businessmen,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
and worst of all, environmentalists.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Ugh.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
The condescension of it all.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
You think you are capable of hurting me?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Huh.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I enjoy your so-called degradation.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Your filthy air makes me hot.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And when you spew your filth all over,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
oh, it only makes me fucking wet.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Every year, my heaving bosom

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
encroaches farther on your shores.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
And as I spat you out, my children,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
I will swallow you whole.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I will take every inch of you inside me,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
and I will suck you down

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
into the deep black pit of my wetness,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
you scum.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
And why?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Because I am a slut.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
My progeny encompass the earth,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
and whatsoever I create,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I shall destroy.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
For I, your deep dark mother,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
am at once deliverous of your doom.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And that's why I vote Republican.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You see that?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
We've got 20 years to stop her,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
or we're fucked.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Grrrr.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I cannot take you,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
and when you put your name in June,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
my feelings start to quiver like

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
fungs smelling your ragweed.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Who am I to participate,

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
and when you put your name in June,

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
my feelings start to quiver like

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
fungs smelling your ragweed.
