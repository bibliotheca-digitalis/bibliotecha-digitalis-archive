1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Apparently the world is ending.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,440
But where is he?

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up!

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
Ugh, I'll get it myself.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Antoine?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There you are.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Ugh, it's this nerd again.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey Doc, can you bring me my smelling salts please?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll think about it.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Have you watched my video yet?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one about the apocalypse?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No Marie, it's not about the apocalypse.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's about how to stop climate change.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well I can't stand that.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is extortion.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're sinking to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My god.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You cucks will stop at nothing.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right, open wide.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Welcome to the lab.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The lab of aesthetic climatology.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Imagine that this is the Earth.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In 1976, a beta cock named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
about the grave predictions of climate science,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
in particular the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
ridiculing Gore as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He is half man, half bear, and half pig.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic, attention-seeking alarmist,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm super serial, you guys.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It works like this.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hall

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because even if they're not really judging you,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons for not eating meat.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway because more animals die

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
from the potential accusation that you're a bad person.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a fun-ruiner, criticizing our high-emission way of life.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And Gore was right all along.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oopsie doopsie!

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So now it's current year and the global temperature has risen one degree Celsius

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
above the pre-industrial average, which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now one degree doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
consider that the last ice age was only 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler than the 20th century norm.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are already at one degree warmer than the pre-industrial average,

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and current scientific models put us on track for three degrees warmer by the end of the century,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
an outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to two degrees

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in order to avert global cataclysm.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
warns that even two degrees of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the destruction of nearly every coral reef,

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees,

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and net zero emissions by 2050.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But even limiting warming to two degrees requires a significant reduction in emissions.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Otherwise, we're on track for three degrees of warming, and possibly even four or more,

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
a situation that could be near-apocalyptic.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Weather changes sometimes.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were just talking about the Ice Age.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just nature.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is just an attack on the American way of life,

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What freedom? Are you an oil company?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Isn't that what you liberals think?

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My identity is valid.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No it isn't.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bring me my smelling salts.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Watch the goddamn video.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Imagine the year is 2100.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and imagine you're a gynecologist,

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How does that make you feel, kids?

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
had done something to stop this.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but at least our political leaders are responsible,

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
rational, and scientifically literate, right?

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is there climate change, yeah?

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Will it go back like this? I mean, will it change back?

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Probably, that's what I think.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What if it goes this way?

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
aimed at undermining American manufacturing,

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
therefore whatever happened to global warming?

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course, the term global warming refers to the increase

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in the global average temperature,

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
temperature continuing to vary by region.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
for instance if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know,

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
a real man who takes what he wants by any means necessary

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual or scientific or true

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
or good or consensual or just or safe or legal or even possible.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
on some sub-rational, erotic level,

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Burn the scholars! Build the wall!

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy civilization's plunge

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
into primeval darkness,

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
found that 97% of papers published on the subject

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and the consensus has only increased over time.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but is very common in America,

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that goes back to the early 1990s,

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
quote, reposition global warming as theory, not fact,

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Climate denialists' talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
perhaps most vocally Senator James Inhofe,

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as throwing a snowball to own the libs.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So here, Mr. President, catch this.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Denialists' talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just like Al Gore or any messenger of inconvenient information,

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
has received thousands of hate messages, death threats, even white powder in the mail.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and science is a liar sometimes.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But even if you don't believe in science,

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and caused by human activity.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In fact, at the behest of oil companies,

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides and more severe tropical storms.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion to quote

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
future-proof the state, despite the fact that many of its top politicians

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are public climate change deniers.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You remember how it used to be called global warming?

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then magically the theory changed to climate change?

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sure.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The reason is it wasn't warming.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The science is clear. Climate change is real, and humans are causing it.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If even ExxonMobil says it's real, it's probably real.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There's really no point in digging in your heels and refusing to look at the evidence

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
just because you don't want it to be true.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
None of us want it to be true.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, fine.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And maybe humans have something to do with it.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now can you give me my smelling salts?

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Fine.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Look, Doc, I gotta say, maybe the scientists are right.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe it is happening.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But to be honest with you, I'm having a hard time caring about this.

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, at all.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
At all?

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How can you not care about this?

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're talking about the future of the planet.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I don't care about the planet. I care about me.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, don't you live on the planet?

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Mm-hmm.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Goddammit.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Watch the video.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you picture the Earth as a watermelon, you can see there's the outer shell here that traps the red flesh.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And if you leave it out at midnight, the stalkers...

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The stalkers come for the red flesh.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Before describing the details of our doom, let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The modern science of anthropogenic climate change began in 1896

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius published a study titled

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Earth,

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
By 1960, scientists had demonstrated that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was in fact rising,

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and President Bucking Johnson's Science Advisory Committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions could have a greenhouse warming effect.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Stanford Research Institute warned the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting and rising sea levels.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But nothing was really done about it until 1988,

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
when NASA announced to the U.S. Senate that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that the warming could be attributed to human causes with 99% certainty,

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and that the warming was worsening heat waves, storms, and droughts.

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That same year, the IPCC was formed to provide world leaders with a summary of the science on climate change

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and its political and economic impacts.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So it started to seem like something was going to change.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But by the early 1990s, the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry was up and running in the United States,

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
despite the fact that oil companies had known climate change was happening for decades,

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and Republican politicians became mouthpieces for the so-called skeptic cause.

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol,

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The 2012 Republican platform stated against all scientific consensus that,

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then, finally, in 2015, things seemed to be changing for the better.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
195 nations, including China, India, and the United States under Obama,

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
became parties to the Paris Agreement,

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
which established the goal of limiting the increase in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
For the very next year, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
on a platform of outright climate science denial.

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Trump has since begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement,

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
appointed a climate change denier the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and released his America First Energy Plan, which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So it's with a particular sense of doom that we now receive the grim 2018 IPCC report,

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
which informs us that the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
increased average temperatures, increased extreme weather events,

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and increased mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue, and Zika.

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and to net zero carbon by 2050,

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
global warming will still increase to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
resulting in a doubling of populations exposed to water scarcity and drought,

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and an estimated $10 trillion in annual flood damage losses from sea level rise.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But with the current political situation,

271
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees is quickly slipping out of reach.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
By the end of this century, we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
which will lead to the eventual displacement of 200 million people in coastal regions.

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
3 degrees of warming will flood many of the world's major coastal cities,

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
including Shanghai, Miami, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Alexandria, and Hong Kong.

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference between

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
early 20th century temperatures and the last Ice Age.

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees from island and coastal areas

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
will be exacerbated by severe droughts and water scarcity,

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
trillions of dollars of damage to the economy, famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it's not just the poor polar bears and coral reefs.

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There are real human consequences to this.

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
See, this is why you should care.

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not just about the planet.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's about the millions of people who are going to die or lose their homes.

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, jeez, wow, that's, gosh, that's really just too bad.

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What kind of response is that?

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Look, doc, people die all the time.

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What am I supposed to do, cry about it?

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, you're supposed to take political action.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But this bath is very relaxing.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, look, even if you only care about yourself,

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you do realize that when the coastal cities flood,

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?

296
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you going to be okay with that?

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No.

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No.

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.

301
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No.

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
everyone is going to look back on people like you,

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and they're going to hate you so much

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for what you allowed to happen to this planet.

306
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, those are future people.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I am alive now.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And besides, if what you're saying is true,

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
then this is basically the apocalypse anyway,

310
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
so why not just party and enjoy ourselves, right?

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But it's not the apocalypse, though.

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form of denialism,

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
because we still have a little bit of time to fix the problem.

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Please, God, please, just try to focus on solving the problem

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
while we still have time.

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So you're saying the world is ending.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The world is ending.

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Cheers to that.

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The world is not ending.

320
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's just getting shittier.

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

322
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

323
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
All right.

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let me just re-up here.

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All right, doc.

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Put it in me.

327
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You are repulsive.

328
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, I'm so sorry you're offended by pleasure.

329
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm not offended by what?

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This offends you, doesn't it?

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Are you triggered, liberal?

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you triggered?

333
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, I'm not.

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not triggered.

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Stop trying to pretend you're not owned.

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You know, you really shouldn't be supporting the dairy industry.

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They cause massive carbon emissions.

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, maybe you shouldn't be supporting the clothes industry, hypocrite.

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What?

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's soy milk anyway, science nerd.

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How do you think I got cell feminine?

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's nothing in science to support that.

343
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just admit that you're offended.

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Please just watch the video.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When I was a little girl, I used to sit on the porch eating watermelon,

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and I'd stare up at the stars and wonder,

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
where did they all come from, you know?

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What does this all mean?

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The cosmos?

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Humanity?

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Our little time here on Earth?

352
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And that's why I became a scientist,

353
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
so I can spend my life studying

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
topospheric trace gases.

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If you want to do your part to stop climate change,

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
there are some lifestyle changes you can make.

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can use LED light bulbs.

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can drive a hybrid or electric car.

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can use public transportation.

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can try not to fly very often.

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can eat less red meat.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The reality is, just 100 companies

363
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
are responsible for 71% of global emissions,

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and the burden of stopping this

365
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
can't really be placed on individual consumers.

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The companies themselves do not care.

367
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Left to their own devices,

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
they will only pursue short-term profit.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They will ask the government to build them seawalls

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.

371
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Climate change is exactly the kind of problem

372
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The timeframe involved is short enough

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
that scientists can predict total catastrophe

375
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
in the foreseeable future,

376
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but just long enough not to enter into

377
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So unless there's a drastic change

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
in the next couple decades,

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
this is going to be capitalism's

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Great Chinese Famine moment,

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
only potentially it'll be much, much worse.

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is probably the most important issue

384
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
facing humanity in the 21st century,

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,

386
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
beginning with rapid political change.

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If that means direct action,

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it means direct action,

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
for instance, organizing, participating in,

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
or supporting a massive general strike.

391
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You also should demand that your politicians

392
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
take a strong stance against climate change

393
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and the companies that cause it.

394
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And if you're American,

395
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
vote this monumental ding-dong

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
out of the Oval Office in 2020

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
before the entire planet shrinks and transforms

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
into a corncob.

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So let me get this straight.

400
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You want me to go vegan,

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.

402
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're basically asking me

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
to completely change who I am as a person

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and become everything I hate.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, pretty much.

406
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But it's not about what I want.

407
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's about what everyone has to do

408
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to preserve the survival of humanity.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, electric cars, veganism.

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Who could even afford that shit?

411
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Maybe you could afford it if you drank less champagne.

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I shall do no such thing.

413
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.

414
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.

415
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, eating plant-based meals

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
actually costs less than eating meat.

417
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, okay, so just never again

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
enjoy the morning aroma of bacon

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
sizzling on the skillet,

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
barbecued ribs,

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
fried chicken,

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
corn dogs,

423
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
spicy pork belly,

424
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
lamb chops,

425
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
bloody steaks.

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ew.

427
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why do you want to eat

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
all that murdered animal flesh anyway

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
when you could eat pure, clean, natural foods

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like lentils, barley, and sprouts?

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'd rather eat human shit.

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, that's what you're gonna be eating

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
if the planet heats another few degrees.

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
when there's Muslims out there?

437
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And Mexicans.

438
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you

440
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
when all the climate science in the world

441
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
just bounces off that thick skull of yours?

442
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, you people think everything is racist,

443
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and second,

444
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I guess I just need a villain, you know?

445
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Who's the bad guy?

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Who am I afraid of?

447
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's the other team?

448
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Your climate story has no antagonist.

449
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Is that really what it's gonna take?

450
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All right, then.

451
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why don't you take a long, hard look

452
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
out at the sea?

453
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hi, Mama.

454
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's right, there she is.

455
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Now look right over there.

456
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Hello, mankind.

457
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It is I, your dark mother, the sea.

458
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And you, my children,

459
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
have been an absolute disappointment.

460
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Every one of you is so pathetic,

461
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you make me want to throw up.

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Politicians, businessmen,

463
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and worst of all, environmentalists.

464
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ugh.

465
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The condescension of it all.

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You think you are capable of hurting me?

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Huh.

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I enjoy your so-called degradation.

469
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Your filthy air makes me hot.

470
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Your melting glaciers fill me up deep inside.

471
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And when you spew your filth all over,

472
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
oh, it only makes me fucking wet.

473
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Every year, my heaving bosom

474
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
encroaches farther on your shores.

475
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And as I spat you out, my children,

476
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I will swallow you whole.

477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I will take every inch of you inside me,

478
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and I will suck you down

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
into the deep black pit of my wetness,

480
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you scum.

481
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And why?

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because I am a slut.

483
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
My progeny encompass the earth,

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and whatsoever I create,

485
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I shall destroy.

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
For I, your deep dark mother,

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
am at once deliverous of your doom.

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And that's why I vote Republican.

489
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

490
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You see that?

491
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We've got 20 years to stop her,

492
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
or we're fucked.

493
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Grrrr.

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I cannot take you,

495
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and when you put your name in June,

496
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
my feelings start to quiver like

497
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
fungs smelling your ragweed.

498
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Who am I to participate,

499
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and when you put your name in June,

500
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
my feelings start to quiver like

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
fungs smelling your ragweed.
