1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,720
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,720
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,480
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,040
not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,840
You know what, America, things have not gone well.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,240
We're having a hard time, we are, between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,600
policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of fascism, the criminal negligence

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,760
of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that has killed 200,000

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
people and counting.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,360
Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,000
a deal, calm down.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,560
People die all the time.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,100
Funny, that's not what you said about Benghazi.

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,100
We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness, and unfortunately, Uncle Joe

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,540
is not really the man for the job.

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,740
I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,660
So this time, I'm going to say something, because even though Biden is not my boy, I

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,500
still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden is the single most important thing any

19
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
American can do right now, to allow me to make my case gorge.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,940
By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,620
firing off hot takes as we speak.

22
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Typical tea-thought Normie Radliv endorses the electoral farce.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,220
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,500
Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about cancel culture than revolt

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,860
against the neoliberal status quo.

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,940
Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan.

27
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,820
You know what Tabitha, for once, I'm actually going to take the bait.

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,540
So this'll be a conversation with the communist Twitter catgirl that lives in my brain, nyah?

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,060
I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,980
disillusioned with the system that they intend not to vote in this election.

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,300
And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but that's fine.

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Maybe I can win over the Russian bot vote.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,220
So I really do understand the perspective that Biden is not worth voting for, because

34
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,140
that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,740
But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.

36
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,940
Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children.

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,740
There's probably asbestos in that tile.

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,340
Because America's so great even the floor is made of poison.

39
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,740
Okay Tabby-chan, give me your worst.

40
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,340
I want free healthcare, student debt canceled, and worker ownership of the means of production.

41
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,540
Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things.

42
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,140
Well listen Tabby-chan, none of us want to vote for Joe Biden.

43
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,340
I don't want to vote for Joe Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom.

44
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,260
But sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so dangerous, well you have no choice but

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,260
to get your hands dirty.

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,300
And in this election, I consider a vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump.

47
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,100
You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician.

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,540
I don't think anyone should stand Joe Biden.

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,540
I'm not asking you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans.

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.

51
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
The president has a big stick.

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:47,940
To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the likely consequences of each candidate winning.

53
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,940
It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.

54
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump.

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,740
The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,540
Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's

57
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,740
no difference between them and the Republicans.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,740
I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,

59
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,740
but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.

60
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,540
Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the

61
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,940
to remove medical nondiscrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

63
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,940
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,940
white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,940
be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
the name of delusional macho posturing.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,540
So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're

68
00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:03,540
in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman, or LGBTQ, or a human who

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
lives on the planet Earth.

70
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,540
So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but

71
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,540
he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.

72
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Well Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that.

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,540
I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for.

74
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,540
So you sit here vote-shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

75
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,540
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan.

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.

78
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,540
your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from

80
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,540
which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into

81
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,540
the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting

82
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
the return of Beelzebub?

83
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
Voting doesn't take that long.

84
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
At most it takes one day.

85
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,540
You can vote and do other things also.

86
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,540
I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch sign.

87
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,540
And I feel you, though to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI style armchair with a pair

88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,540
of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.

89
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Could you be any bougier?

90
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
Don't call me bougie.

91
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
I'm beyond bougie.

92
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,540
When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.

93
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,540
I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.

94
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,540
You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.

95
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,540
Why should I listen to what you say?

96
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh, you shouldn't.

97
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.

98
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,540
But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the

99
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
first against the wall.

100
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,540
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with.

101
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,540
You at least have to admire that about us libs.

102
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,540
We have a remarkable willingness to have play conversations with people who are trying

103
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
to kill us.

104
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan, Tabitha?

105
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,540
Uh, protest?

106
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,540
Unionize?

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Mutual aid?

108
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Strikes?

109
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
So I totally agree, those are all good things to do.

110
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,540
I've gone to protests myself this year, I've given to a mutual aid group.

111
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,540
You know, you're right, that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get

112
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
involved in local things like that.

113
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,540
But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

114
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.

115
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,540
So, in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.

116
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Why participate in this charade of a farcical election?

117
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,540
America is not democratic, it's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.

118
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.

119
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,

120
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
DC being disenfranchised.

121
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,540
All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists

122
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,540
boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

123
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.

124
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Ew.

125
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.

126
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,540
It's boring, it's incrementalist, it doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,540
or being edgier than your parents.

128
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,540
But, you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around

129
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
your friends.

130
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?

131
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who place their

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
hope in fallible human beings.

133
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
All of which is very not cool.

134
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,540
I feel like so much internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.

135
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,540
It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through

136
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,540
all the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce.

137
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,540
But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting and demeaning the people

138
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,540
who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.

139
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:48,540
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different

140
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,540
from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

141
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,540
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

142
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?

143
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,540
This ends in violence either way, so he may as well smash.

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.

145
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,540
But if there's a decisive Biden victory, and it's not some kind of vote-recount-nightmare

146
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,540
scenario, then I think the military will force Trump to leave.

147
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Don't get me wrong Tabby Chan, times are tough.

148
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
The president is a fascist.

149
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,540
I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.

150
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,540
But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies.

151
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,540
And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory,

152
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,540
therefore rejecting democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.

153
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,540
So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

154
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,540
But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world.

155
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,540
The whole system is broken, and voting won't change that.

156
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,540
We don't need a Democrat, we need to end capitalism.

157
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order.

158
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,540
When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift

159
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,540
in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us

160
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,540
that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending.

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Like before capitalism there was feudalism, and feudalism ended

162
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,540
over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production,

163
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,540
not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.

164
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,540
So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?

165
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,540
I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished

166
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
by a small group of activists.

167
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,540
And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you,

168
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
but the vast majority of Americans are not communists.

169
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,540
I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated sense

170
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
of how big and important they are.

171
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,540
I fell prey to it myself, like I was so sure that Bernie was gonna win the primary,

172
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,540
in part because when I looked at my timeline,

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,540
I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie

174
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
and contempt for the mainstream Dems.

175
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,540
But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds,

176
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,540
is a finely curated and very unrepresentative sample of the population.

177
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,540
You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.

178
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Most users rarely tweet, and 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.

179
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,540
So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans,

180
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
and it's not a representative 2%.

181
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,540
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population

182
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,540
in that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,

183
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
more educated, and a higher income.

184
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,540
And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller,

185
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,540
even more unrepresentative sample within a sample.

186
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,540
We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.

187
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,540
And that less than 0.1% does have an outsized influence

188
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
because they're prolific tweeters,

189
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.

190
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture,

191
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,540
even though cancel culture is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.

192
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,540
So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians

193
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,540
cater to this retrograde soft conservatism,

194
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

195
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign,

196
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,540
and I enraged people's dogs by knocking on their doors

197
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,540
and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls.

198
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,540
And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election,

199
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,540
even though it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.

200
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
You know, you do have to listen to a lot of

201
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.

202
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,540
Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama's not sending his death panels

203
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,540
out to your landscaping business, but whatever.

204
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities

205
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,540
of what your fellow Americans actually care about.

206
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

207
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
I talked to union families,

208
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
but I don't think I talked to a single communist.

209
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
You know, most people do not read theory.

210
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,540
Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their families.

211
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
They want personal security and prosperity.

212
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,540
And if you look at the talking points used by politicians, they reflect that.

213
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
It's why the right hammer's on about Antifa so much.

214
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Because it works.

215
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,540
Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

216
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,540
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots,

217
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,540
it scares the shit out of people.

218
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Of course, in reality, Antifa is not scary.

219
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
Like, I've met Antifa.

220
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,540
And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

221
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,540
It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends.

222
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,540
But look, if what you want is socialism, or even just social democracy,

223
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.

224
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,540
You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness.

225
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
But you don't want to do that,

226
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,540
because it requires that you stop owning the libs,

227
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,540
and start actually communicating with them.

228
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,540
You have to build alliances with like, Facebook moms,

229
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
who ask ignorant questions like,

230
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
what's indigenous people's day?

231
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,540
And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the height of praxis,

232
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,540
and who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing.

233
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
You know, you can't let your radical queer friends

234
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.

235
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
How very bourgeois.

236
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,540
But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

237
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution

238
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
and overthrow the US government.

239
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,540
That's very valid.

240
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,540
That's super hecking valid.

241
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,540
That's extremely valid.

242
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,540
I mean, I guess I admire the ambition.

243
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Just a couple quick follow-up questions though.

244
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Are you counting on the US military and police

245
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
taking the side of the communists,

246
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,540
or is your plan to overpower them?

247
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,

248
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
I don't think that much of the military is going to defect

249
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
to join a communist revolution.

250
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,540
So, there will have to be a war.

251
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight.

252
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,540
After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923,

253
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,540
so you are going to need to raise a Red Army.

254
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,540
I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?

255
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
So, how's that going, Tabitha?

256
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
How many weapons have you amassed?

257
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,540
How many units have you trained?

258
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
Why are we talking about this?

259
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Why am I even entertaining this notion?

260
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,540
You know, when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,

261
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
they actually mean it.

262
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,

263
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,540
the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys.

264
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,540
They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them.

265
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
They have ex-military men in their ranks,

266
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,540
and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.

267
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,540
Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,

268
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,540
it strikes me as ideation, not intent.

269
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,540
You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between

270
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
two kinds of suicidal thinking.

271
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
So, there's intent, which is when you have a plan

272
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
for how you're going to do it,

273
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,540
and then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.

274
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
And then there's ideation, which is, you know,

275
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540
you're not actually going to do it,

276
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,

277
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
I just want to die.

278
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,540
There's no more joy for me left in this world.

279
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I just can't stand it anymore.

280
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I just want to end it all.

281
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,540
And then my psychiatrist says,

282
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
Well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro.

283
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
And I say,

284
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,540
Not again, doctor.

285
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Not again.

286
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,540
So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

287
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
whereas left-wing radical discourse

288
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,540
often amounts to revolutionary ideation.

289
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,540
It's a kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics.

290
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Well, you can't plan a revolution.

291
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,540
Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.

292
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Yeah, so, a riot is the language of the unheard.

293
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,540
But what kind of language is it?

294
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,540
What is the point of speaking through a riot,

295
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,540
or a protest, or a strike?

296
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry?

297
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?

298
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Heard by whomst?

299
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Who are you trying to persuade?

300
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,540
The glob glob glob glob?

301
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,540
No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.

302
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,540
So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen.

303
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,540
This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements in history.

304
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,540
And what has that accomplished?

305
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,540
Well, at the moment, we have a president

306
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
promising to double down on law and order,

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
on military police suppression,

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
a president who told a room full of cops

309
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,540
not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.

310
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,540
And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon,

311
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
you just see them thrown in.

312
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Rough.

313
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,540
I said, please don't be too nice.

314
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
And let's be clear.

315
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Both Biden and Copmola have an ugly record

316
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
when it comes to crime and policing.

317
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,540
For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing,

318
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
which is the opposite of what we need right now.

319
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan.

320
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,540
But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse

321
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
about policing and criminal justice.

322
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,540
And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.

323
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
This year's Democratic platform includes things like

324
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
stricter use of force standards,

325
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,540
banning chokeholds,

326
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
restricting qualified immunity,

327
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
creating a registry of police misconduct,

328
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
limiting no-knock warrants,

329
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
decriminalizing weed,

330
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,540
investing in crime prevention and social work.

331
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
And is that good enough?

332
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
No, it's not good enough.

333
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
But it's a start.

334
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
It's progress.

335
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
It shows that the Democrats

336
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
are at least willing to listen to protests.

337
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,540
When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,

338
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill

339
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
because that would have been super unpopular

340
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
with the Southern Democrats.

341
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
But then 1963 happened,

342
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,540
and there were protests and uprisings all over the South

343
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
and the March on Washington that summer.

344
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
And Kennedy listened.

345
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
The events in Birmingham and elsewhere

346
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,540
have so increased the cries for equality

347
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,540
that no city or state or legislative body

348
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
can prudently choose to ignore them.

349
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,540
He was moved by the protests,

350
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
and he responded by introducing

351
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,540
what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

352
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,540
But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?

353
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
What if some fascist had been president?

354
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
What if Trump had been president?

355
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act.

356
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,540
So it does matter who's president.

357
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
It actually matters a lot.

358
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
And please, Tabby Chun,

359
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,540
do not let a fascist win to own the libs.

360
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Goddamn it.

361
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,540
All right, fam, let's open a new tab.

362
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Go to vote.gov and enter your state.

363
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,540
And yeah, I know this is boring,

364
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
but I'm trying to think about the tantrum

365
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Trump is gonna throw when an entire nation rejects him,

366
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,540
and I'm letting that motivate me.

367
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
In some states, you can still register,

368
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
so register now if you still haven't.

369
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,540
If you're voting in person,

370
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,540
go to vote.org and find your polling place

371
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,540
and make a plan for how you're gonna get there.

372
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Make sure your phone's charged,

373
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
and you might want to bring some snacks

374
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
or even some friends.

375
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
If you're like me, you need to set an alarm

376
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
so you don't forget,

377
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
and then just try not to get inconsolably high

378
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
until after you've placed your vote.

379
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,540
Because we've all been living through a year of hell,

380
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,540
and I, for one, think that we all deserve

381
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,540
to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives

382
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,540
this swindling, pestilent doofus.

383
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Vote him out!

384
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,540
The increase of his government

385
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,540
and his view of the new era

386
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,540
and the birth of a new day

387
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,540
did not mean that his government

388
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,540
did not change the judgment of the United States.

389
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,540
It gave me a feeling of hope

390
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,540
that one day we'll see

391
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,540
a little lost testimony.

392
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Next, I shall not dare

393
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,540
to destroy your world.

394
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,540
I shall not

395
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,540
destroy your world.

396
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,540
I shall not

397
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,540
destroy your world.

398
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,540
For I know the thoughts that I've made words

399
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,540
for tears, for words, for thoughts, for pieces.

400
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,540
I will destroy

401
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,540
your world

402
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,540
I shall not destroy

403
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,540
your world.

404
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,540
I shall not

405
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,540
destroy

406
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,540
your world.

407
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,540
I will take away

408
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,540
the sins of the world.

409
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,540
I shall take away

410
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,540
the sins of the world.

411
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I shall take away

412
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,540
the knowledge of the Lord

413
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,540
as the waters cover the sea.

414
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

415
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,540
So give me peace,

416
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

417
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Give me your love,

418
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

419
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Give me your love,

420
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

421
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

422
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,540
So give me your love,

423
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

424
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Give me your love,

425
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

426
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Give me your love,

427
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

428
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,540
We are the children of the knowledge,

429
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,540
the knowledge of the Lord

430
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,540
as the waters cover the sea.

431
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

432
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,540
So give me your love,

433
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

434
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,540
Give me your love,

435
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,540
so that I may be able to give you peace.
