0	16720	Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush
16720	22720	aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson
22720	31480	is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will
31480	35040	not stop until I reach the gates of hell.
35040	41840	You know what, America, things have not gone well.
41840	47240	We're having a hard time, we are, between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive
47240	53600	policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of fascism, the criminal negligence
53600	58760	of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that has killed 200,000
58760	59760	people and counting.
59760	64360	Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big
64360	68000	a deal, calm down.
68000	69560	People die all the time.
69560	74100	Funny, that's not what you said about Benghazi.
74100	80100	We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness, and unfortunately, Uncle Joe
80100	82540	is not really the man for the job.
82540	87740	I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.
87740	92660	So this time, I'm going to say something, because even though Biden is not my boy, I
92660	97500	still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden is the single most important thing any
97500	102500	American can do right now, to allow me to make my case gorge.
102500	105940	By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're
105940	108620	firing off hot takes as we speak.
108620	113460	Typical tea-thought Normie Radliv endorses the electoral farce.
113460	116220	Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?
116220	120500	Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about cancel culture than revolt
120500	122860	against the neoliberal status quo.
122860	124940	Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan.
124940	128820	You know what Tabitha, for once, I'm actually going to take the bait.
128820	134540	So this'll be a conversation with the communist Twitter catgirl that lives in my brain, nyah?
134540	140060	I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so
140060	144980	disillusioned with the system that they intend not to vote in this election.
144980	148300	And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but that's fine.
148300	150900	Maybe I can win over the Russian bot vote.
150900	155220	So I really do understand the perspective that Biden is not worth voting for, because
155220	158140	that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.
158140	162740	But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.
162740	164940	Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children.
164940	166740	There's probably asbestos in that tile.
166740	169340	Because America's so great even the floor is made of poison.
169340	171740	Okay Tabby-chan, give me your worst.
171740	177340	I want free healthcare, student debt canceled, and worker ownership of the means of production.
177340	182540	Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things.
182540	186140	Well listen Tabby-chan, none of us want to vote for Joe Biden.
186140	190340	I don't want to vote for Joe Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom.
190340	195260	But sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so dangerous, well you have no choice but
195260	196260	to get your hands dirty.
196260	202300	And in this election, I consider a vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump.
202300	208100	You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician.
208100	210540	I don't think anyone should stand Joe Biden.
210540	215540	I'm not asking you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans.
215540	217540	Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.
217540	219540	The president has a big stick.
219540	227940	To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the likely consequences of each candidate winning.
227940	233940	It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.
233940	236940	Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump.
236940	241740	The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.
241940	247540	Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's
247540	249740	no difference between them and the Republicans.
249740	254740	I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,
254740	259740	but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.
259740	263540	Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the
263540	267540	Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting
267540	271940	to remove medical nondiscrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the
271940	275940	integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling
275940	280940	white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to
280940	285940	be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in
285940	287940	the name of delusional macho posturing.
287940	292540	So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're
292540	303540	in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman, or LGBTQ, or a human who
303540	305540	lives on the planet Earth.
305540	309540	So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but
309540	312540	he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.
312540	316540	Well Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that.
316540	321540	I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for.
321540	326540	So you sit here vote-shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?
326540	331540	You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.
331540	332540	Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan.
332540	335540	Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.
335540	339540	Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit
339540	343540	your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from
343540	348540	which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into
348540	352540	the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting
352540	354540	the return of Beelzebub?
354540	356540	Voting doesn't take that long.
356540	358540	At most it takes one day.
358540	360540	You can vote and do other things also.
360540	364540	I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch sign.
364540	370540	And I feel you, though to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI style armchair with a pair
370540	373540	of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.
373540	375540	Could you be any bougier?
375540	376540	Don't call me bougie.
376540	377540	I'm beyond bougie.
377540	381540	When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.
381540	386540	I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.
386540	390540	You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.
390540	392540	Why should I listen to what you say?
392540	393540	Oh, you shouldn't.
393540	395540	I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.
395540	399540	But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the
399540	400540	first against the wall.
400540	403540	Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with.
403540	406540	You at least have to admire that about us libs.
406540	410540	We have a remarkable willingness to have play conversations with people who are trying
410540	411540	to kill us.
411540	416540	Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan, Tabitha?
416540	418540	Uh, protest?
418540	419540	Unionize?
419540	420540	Mutual aid?
420540	421540	Strikes?
421540	424540	So I totally agree, those are all good things to do.
424540	428540	I've gone to protests myself this year, I've given to a mutual aid group.
428540	431540	You know, you're right, that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get
431540	433540	involved in local things like that.
433540	435540	But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?
436540	438540	And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.
438540	442540	So, in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.
442540	445540	Why participate in this charade of a farcical election?
445540	450540	America is not democratic, it's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.
450540	455540	Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.
455540	460540	Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,
460540	462540	DC being disenfranchised.
463540	467540	All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists
467540	471540	boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.
471540	474540	Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.
474540	475540	Ew.
475540	478540	Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.
478540	482540	It's boring, it's incrementalist, it doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs
482540	484540	or being edgier than your parents.
484540	488540	But, you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around
488540	489540	your friends.
489540	492540	Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?
492540	497540	Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who place their
497540	499540	hope in fallible human beings.
499540	501540	All of which is very not cool.
501540	506540	I feel like so much internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.
506540	511540	It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through
511540	515540	all the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce.
515540	519540	But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting and demeaning the people
519540	522540	who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.
522540	528540	And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different
528540	531540	from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.
531540	536540	Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.
536540	539540	Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?
539540	542540	This ends in violence either way, so he may as well smash.
543540	545540	Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.
545540	551540	But if there's a decisive Biden victory, and it's not some kind of vote-recount-nightmare
551540	555540	scenario, then I think the military will force Trump to leave.
555540	557540	Don't get me wrong Tabby Chan, times are tough.
557540	559540	The president is a fascist.
559540	563540	I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.
563540	566540	But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies.
566540	571540	And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory,
571540	576540	therefore rejecting democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.
576540	579540	So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.
579540	582540	But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world.
582540	585540	The whole system is broken, and voting won't change that.
585540	589540	We don't need a Democrat, we need to end capitalism.
589540	595540	Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order.
595540	600540	When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift
600540	603540	in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us
603540	607540	that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending.
607540	611540	Like before capitalism there was feudalism, and feudalism ended
611540	616540	over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production,
616540	621540	not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.
621540	626540	So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?
626540	629540	I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished
629540	631540	by a small group of activists.
631540	634540	And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you,
634540	637540	but the vast majority of Americans are not communists.
637540	641540	I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated sense
641540	643540	of how big and important they are.
643540	648540	I fell prey to it myself, like I was so sure that Bernie was gonna win the primary,
648540	651540	in part because when I looked at my timeline,
651540	654540	I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie
654540	656540	and contempt for the mainstream Dems.
656540	659540	But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds,
659540	664540	is a finely curated and very unrepresentative sample of the population.
664540	668540	You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.
668540	673540	Most users rarely tweet, and 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.
673540	677540	So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans,
677540	679540	and it's not a representative 2%.
679540	683540	According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population
683540	687540	in that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,
687540	689540	more educated, and a higher income.
689540	693540	And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller,
693540	697540	even more unrepresentative sample within a sample.
697540	700540	We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.
700540	703540	And that less than 0.1% does have an outsized influence
703540	705540	because they're prolific tweeters,
705540	708540	and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.
708540	711540	Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture,
711540	715540	even though cancel culture is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.
715540	718540	So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians
718540	722540	cater to this retrograde soft conservatism,
722540	724540	you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.
724540	728540	Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign,
728540	732540	and I enraged people's dogs by knocking on their doors
732540	735540	and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls.
735540	739540	And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election,
739540	743540	even though it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.
743540	745540	You know, you do have to listen to a lot of
745540	750540	I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.
750540	754540	Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama's not sending his death panels
754540	757540	out to your landscaping business, but whatever.
757540	759540	Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities
759540	762540	of what your fellow Americans actually care about.
762540	765540	And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,
765540	767540	I talked to union families,
767540	770540	but I don't think I talked to a single communist.
770540	772540	You know, most people do not read theory.
772540	777540	Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their families.
777540	779540	They want personal security and prosperity.
779540	783540	And if you look at the talking points used by politicians, they reflect that.
783540	786540	It's why the right hammer's on about Antifa so much.
786540	787540	Because it works.
787540	790540	Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.
790540	793540	And this idea of Antifa looters and riots,
793540	795540	it scares the shit out of people.
795540	797540	Of course, in reality, Antifa is not scary.
797540	799540	Like, I've met Antifa.
799540	803540	And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.
803540	808540	It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends.
808540	813540	But look, if what you want is socialism, or even just social democracy,
813540	816540	then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.
816540	820540	You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness.
820540	822540	But you don't want to do that,
822540	824540	because it requires that you stop owning the libs,
824540	826540	and start actually communicating with them.
826540	830540	You have to build alliances with like, Facebook moms,
830540	832540	who ask ignorant questions like,
832540	834540	what's indigenous people's day?
834540	838540	And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the height of praxis,
838540	841540	and who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing.
841540	843540	You know, you can't let your radical queer friends
843540	846540	catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.
846540	848540	How very bourgeois.
848540	853540	But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.
853540	858540	Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution
858540	860540	and overthrow the US government.
860540	863540	That's very valid.
863540	866540	That's super hecking valid.
866540	869540	That's extremely valid.
869540	872540	I mean, I guess I admire the ambition.
872540	875540	Just a couple quick follow-up questions though.
875540	877540	Are you counting on the US military and police
877540	879540	taking the side of the communists,
879540	881540	or is your plan to overpower them?
881540	884540	Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,
884540	886540	I don't think that much of the military is going to defect
886540	888540	to join a communist revolution.
888540	891540	So, there will have to be a war.
891540	893540	You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight.
893540	898540	After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923,
898540	901540	so you are going to need to raise a Red Army.
901540	904540	I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?
904540	906540	So, how's that going, Tabitha?
906540	909540	How many weapons have you amassed?
909540	911540	How many units have you trained?
911540	913540	Why are we talking about this?
913540	915540	Why am I even entertaining this notion?
915540	918540	You know, when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,
918540	920540	they actually mean it.
920540	922540	And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,
922540	925540	the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys.
925540	928540	They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them.
928540	930540	They have ex-military men in their ranks,
930540	933540	and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.
933540	937540	Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,
937540	940540	it strikes me as ideation, not intent.
940540	943540	You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between
943540	945540	two kinds of suicidal thinking.
945540	948540	So, there's intent, which is when you have a plan
948540	950540	for how you're going to do it,
950540	953540	and then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.
953540	955540	And then there's ideation, which is, you know,
955540	957540	you're not actually going to do it,
957540	960540	you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,
960540	962540	I just want to die.
962540	964540	There's no more joy for me left in this world.
964540	966540	I just can't stand it anymore.
966540	968540	I just want to end it all.
968540	970540	And then my psychiatrist says,
970540	973540	Well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro.
973540	975540	And I say,
975540	977540	Not again, doctor.
977540	978540	Not again.
978540	982540	So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,
982540	984540	whereas left-wing radical discourse
984540	988540	often amounts to revolutionary ideation.
988540	992540	It's a kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics.
992540	995540	Well, you can't plan a revolution.
995540	999540	Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.
999540	1002540	Yeah, so, a riot is the language of the unheard.
1002540	1004540	But what kind of language is it?
1004540	1007540	What is the point of speaking through a riot,
1007540	1009540	or a protest, or a strike?
1009540	1013540	Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry?
1013540	1016540	Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?
1016540	1017540	Heard by whomst?
1017540	1018540	Who are you trying to persuade?
1018540	1020540	The glob glob glob glob?
1020540	1024540	No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.
1024540	1027540	So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen.
1027540	1031540	This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements in history.
1031540	1033540	And what has that accomplished?
1033540	1035540	Well, at the moment, we have a president
1035540	1037540	promising to double down on law and order,
1037540	1039540	on military police suppression,
1039540	1041540	a president who told a room full of cops
1041540	1044540	not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.
1044540	1048540	And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon,
1048540	1049540	you just see them thrown in.
1049540	1050540	Rough.
1050540	1053540	I said, please don't be too nice.
1053540	1054540	And let's be clear.
1054540	1058540	Both Biden and Copmola have an ugly record
1058540	1059540	when it comes to crime and policing.
1059540	1062540	For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing,
1062540	1064540	which is the opposite of what we need right now.
1064540	1066540	I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan.
1066540	1069540	But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse
1069540	1071540	about policing and criminal justice.
1071540	1075540	And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.
1075540	1077540	This year's Democratic platform includes things like
1077540	1079540	stricter use of force standards,
1079540	1080540	banning chokeholds,
1080540	1082540	restricting qualified immunity,
1082540	1084540	creating a registry of police misconduct,
1084540	1086540	limiting no-knock warrants,
1086540	1088540	decriminalizing weed,
1088540	1090540	investing in crime prevention and social work.
1090540	1091540	And is that good enough?
1091540	1093540	No, it's not good enough.
1093540	1094540	But it's a start.
1094540	1095540	It's progress.
1096540	1097540	It shows that the Democrats
1097540	1099540	are at least willing to listen to protests.
1099540	1102540	When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,
1102540	1104540	he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill
1104540	1106540	because that would have been super unpopular
1106540	1107540	with the Southern Democrats.
1107540	1109540	But then 1963 happened,
1109540	1112540	and there were protests and uprisings all over the South
1112540	1114540	and the March on Washington that summer.
1114540	1116540	And Kennedy listened.
1116540	1118540	The events in Birmingham and elsewhere
1118540	1122540	have so increased the cries for equality
1122540	1126540	that no city or state or legislative body
1126540	1128540	can prudently choose to ignore them.
1128540	1130540	He was moved by the protests,
1130540	1132540	and he responded by introducing
1132540	1135540	what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
1135540	1138540	But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?
1138540	1140540	What if some fascist had been president?
1140540	1142540	What if Trump had been president?
1142540	1144540	We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act.
1144540	1147540	So it does matter who's president.
1147540	1149540	It actually matters a lot.
1150540	1152540	And please, Tabby Chun,
1152540	1155540	do not let a fascist win to own the libs.
1155540	1156540	Goddamn it.
1156540	1159540	All right, fam, let's open a new tab.
1159540	1162540	Go to vote.gov and enter your state.
1162540	1164540	And yeah, I know this is boring,
1164540	1166540	but I'm trying to think about the tantrum
1166540	1169540	Trump is gonna throw when an entire nation rejects him,
1169540	1172540	and I'm letting that motivate me.
1172540	1174540	In some states, you can still register,
1174540	1176540	so register now if you still haven't.
1176540	1178540	If you're voting in person,
1178540	1181540	go to vote.org and find your polling place
1181540	1184540	and make a plan for how you're gonna get there.
1184540	1186540	Make sure your phone's charged,
1186540	1188540	and you might want to bring some snacks
1188540	1190540	or even some friends.
1190540	1192540	If you're like me, you need to set an alarm
1192540	1194540	so you don't forget,
1194540	1197540	and then just try not to get inconsolably high
1197540	1199540	until after you've placed your vote.
1199540	1202540	Because we've all been living through a year of hell,
1202540	1205540	and I, for one, think that we all deserve
1205540	1209540	to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives
1209540	1213540	this swindling, pestilent doofus.
1213540	1215540	Vote him out!
1215540	1218540	The increase of his government
1218540	1222540	and his view of the new era
1222540	1225540	and the birth of a new day
1225540	1229540	did not mean that his government
1229540	1234540	did not change the judgment of the United States.
1234540	1238540	It gave me a feeling of hope
1238540	1241540	that one day we'll see
1241540	1244540	a little lost testimony.
1244540	1248540	Next, I shall not dare
1248540	1251540	to destroy your world.
1251540	1254540	I shall not
1254540	1257540	destroy your world.
1257540	1260540	I shall not
1260540	1264540	destroy your world.
1264540	1268540	For I know the thoughts that I've made words
1268540	1273540	for tears, for words, for thoughts, for pieces.
1273540	1278540	I will destroy
1278540	1282540	your world
1282540	1286540	I shall not destroy
1286540	1291540	your world.
1291540	1294540	I shall not
1294540	1297540	destroy
1297540	1301540	your world.
1301540	1305540	I will take away
1305540	1309540	the sins of the world.
1309540	1313540	I shall take away
1313540	1317540	the sins of the world.
1317540	1321540	I shall take away
1321540	1325540	the knowledge of the Lord
1325540	1329540	as the waters cover the sea.
1329540	1335540	For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.
1335540	1338540	So give me peace,
1338540	1342540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1342540	1345540	Give me your love,
1345540	1348540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1348540	1352540	Give me your love,
1352540	1355540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1355540	1359540	For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.
1359540	1362540	So give me your love,
1362540	1366540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1366540	1370540	Give me your love,
1370540	1374540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1374540	1378540	Give me your love,
1378540	1382540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1382540	1386540	We are the children of the knowledge,
1386540	1390540	the knowledge of the Lord
1390540	1394540	as the waters cover the sea.
1394540	1398540	For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.
1398540	1402540	So give me your love,
1402540	1406540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
1406540	1410540	Give me your love,
1410540	1414540	so that I may be able to give you peace.
