WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.720
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

00:16.720 --> 00:22.720
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

00:22.720 --> 00:31.480
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will

00:31.480 --> 00:35.040
not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

00:35.040 --> 00:41.840
You know what, America, things have not gone well.

00:41.840 --> 00:47.240
We're having a hard time, we are, between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive

00:47.240 --> 00:53.600
policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising tide of fascism, the criminal negligence

00:53.600 --> 00:58.760
of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that has killed 200,000

00:58.760 --> 00:59.760
people and counting.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.360
Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big

01:04.360 --> 01:08.000
a deal, calm down.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.560
People die all the time.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.100
Funny, that's not what you said about Benghazi.

01:14.100 --> 01:20.100
We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness, and unfortunately, Uncle Joe

01:20.100 --> 01:22.540
is not really the man for the job.

01:22.540 --> 01:27.740
I was a Bernie supporter, and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.

01:27.740 --> 01:32.660
So this time, I'm going to say something, because even though Biden is not my boy, I

01:32.660 --> 01:37.500
still think that dethroning Trump by electing Biden is the single most important thing any

01:37.500 --> 01:42.500
American can do right now, to allow me to make my case gorge.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.940
By now, leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video, and I'm sure they're

01:45.940 --> 01:48.620
firing off hot takes as we speak.

01:48.620 --> 01:53.460
Typical tea-thought Normie Radliv endorses the electoral farce.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.220
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?

01:56.220 --> 02:00.500
Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about cancel culture than revolt

02:00.500 --> 02:02.860
against the neoliberal status quo.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.940
Tabby-chan, Tabby-chan.

02:04.940 --> 02:08.820
You know what Tabitha, for once, I'm actually going to take the bait.

02:08.820 --> 02:14.540
So this'll be a conversation with the communist Twitter catgirl that lives in my brain, nyah?

02:14.540 --> 02:20.060
I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so

02:20.060 --> 02:24.980
disillusioned with the system that they intend not to vote in this election.

02:24.980 --> 02:28.300
And yeah, some of them are probably Russian bots, but that's fine.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.900
Maybe I can win over the Russian bot vote.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.220
So I really do understand the perspective that Biden is not worth voting for, because

02:35.220 --> 02:38.140
that was also my first reflex when he was nominated.

02:38.140 --> 02:42.740
But on reflection, I think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.940
Don't make me eat my bathroom tile, children.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.740
There's probably asbestos in that tile.

02:46.740 --> 02:49.340
Because America's so great even the floor is made of poison.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.740
Okay Tabby-chan, give me your worst.

02:51.740 --> 02:57.340
I want free healthcare, student debt canceled, and worker ownership of the means of production.

02:57.340 --> 03:02.540
Biden won't give us any of that, and I don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things.

03:02.540 --> 03:06.140
Well listen Tabby-chan, none of us want to vote for Joe Biden.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.340
I don't want to vote for Joe Biden any more than I want to retile my bathroom.

03:10.340 --> 03:15.260
But sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so dangerous, well you have no choice but

03:15.260 --> 03:16.260
to get your hands dirty.

03:16.260 --> 03:22.300
And in this election, I consider a vote for Biden primarily a vote against Trump.

03:22.300 --> 03:28.100
You know, voting for a politician is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.540
I don't think anyone should stand Joe Biden.

03:30.540 --> 03:35.540
I'm not asking you to like, comment, and subscribe to Joe Biden's OnlyFans.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.540
Fascinating, though I'm sure it is.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.540
The president has a big stick.

03:39.540 --> 03:47.940
To me, voting is more of a utilitarian calculation, based on the likely consequences of each candidate winning.

03:47.940 --> 03:53.940
It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.940
Bad strategy. Biden is no better than Trump.

03:56.940 --> 04:01.740
The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.

04:01.940 --> 04:07.540
Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's

04:07.540 --> 04:09.740
no difference between them and the Republicans.

04:09.740 --> 04:14.740
I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,

04:14.740 --> 04:19.740
but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.

04:19.740 --> 04:23.540
Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the

04:23.540 --> 04:27.540
Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

04:27.540 --> 04:31.940
to remove medical nondiscrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

04:31.940 --> 04:35.940
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling

04:35.940 --> 04:40.940
white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to

04:40.940 --> 04:45.940
be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing a deadly pandemic in

04:45.940 --> 04:47.940
the name of delusional macho posturing.

04:47.940 --> 04:52.540
So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're

04:52.540 --> 05:03.540
in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman, or LGBTQ, or a human who

05:03.540 --> 05:05.540
lives on the planet Earth.

05:05.540 --> 05:09.540
So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but

05:09.540 --> 05:12.540
he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.

05:12.540 --> 05:16.540
Well Tabby Chan, I'm sorry to say I agree with you about that.

05:16.540 --> 05:21.540
I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted for.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.540
So you sit here vote-shaming me, and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

05:26.540 --> 05:31.540
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.540
Tabby Chan, Tabby Chan.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.540
Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.

05:35.540 --> 05:39.540
Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit

05:39.540 --> 05:43.540
your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from

05:43.540 --> 05:48.540
which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into

05:48.540 --> 05:52.540
the forest and re-entering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting

05:52.540 --> 05:54.540
the return of Beelzebub?

05:54.540 --> 05:56.540
Voting doesn't take that long.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.540
At most it takes one day.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.540
You can vote and do other things also.

06:00.540 --> 06:04.540
I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch sign.

06:04.540 --> 06:10.540
And I feel you, though to be honest, I would eat a Louis XVI style armchair with a pair

06:10.540 --> 06:13.540
of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.540
Could you be any bougier?

06:15.540 --> 06:16.540
Don't call me bougie.

06:16.540 --> 06:17.540
I'm beyond bougie.

06:17.540 --> 06:21.540
When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.

06:21.540 --> 06:26.540
I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.540
You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.540
Why should I listen to what you say?

06:32.540 --> 06:33.540
Oh, you shouldn't.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.540
I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.

06:35.540 --> 06:39.540
But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the

06:39.540 --> 06:40.540
first against the wall.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.540
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly and get it over with.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.540
You at least have to admire that about us libs.

06:46.540 --> 06:50.540
We have a remarkable willingness to have play conversations with people who are trying

06:50.540 --> 06:51.540
to kill us.

06:51.540 --> 06:56.540
Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan, Tabitha?

06:56.540 --> 06:58.540
Uh, protest?

06:58.540 --> 06:59.540
Unionize?

06:59.540 --> 07:00.540
Mutual aid?

07:00.540 --> 07:01.540
Strikes?

07:01.540 --> 07:04.540
So I totally agree, those are all good things to do.

07:04.540 --> 07:08.540
I've gone to protests myself this year, I've given to a mutual aid group.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.540
You know, you're right, that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get

07:11.540 --> 07:13.540
involved in local things like that.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.540
But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

07:16.540 --> 07:18.540
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.

07:18.540 --> 07:22.540
So, in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.540
Why participate in this charade of a farcical election?

07:25.540 --> 07:30.540
America is not democratic, it's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.

07:30.540 --> 07:35.540
Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.

07:35.540 --> 07:40.540
Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,

07:40.540 --> 07:42.540
DC being disenfranchised.

07:43.540 --> 07:47.540
All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists

07:47.540 --> 07:51.540
boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.540
Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.540
Ew.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.540
Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.

07:58.540 --> 08:02.540
It's boring, it's incrementalist, it doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs

08:02.540 --> 08:04.540
or being edgier than your parents.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.540
But, you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around

08:08.540 --> 08:09.540
your friends.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.540
Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?

08:12.540 --> 08:17.540
Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who place their

08:17.540 --> 08:19.540
hope in fallible human beings.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.540
All of which is very not cool.

08:21.540 --> 08:26.540
I feel like so much internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.

08:26.540 --> 08:31.540
It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through

08:31.540 --> 08:35.540
all the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce.

08:35.540 --> 08:39.540
But all you're doing about it is sitting here shitposting and demeaning the people

08:39.540 --> 08:42.540
who are actually trying to accomplish what little can be accomplished.

08:42.540 --> 08:48.540
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different

08:48.540 --> 08:51.540
from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

08:51.540 --> 08:56.540
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.540
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?

08:59.540 --> 09:02.540
This ends in violence either way, so he may as well smash.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.540
Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly.

09:05.540 --> 09:11.540
But if there's a decisive Biden victory, and it's not some kind of vote-recount-nightmare

09:11.540 --> 09:15.540
scenario, then I think the military will force Trump to leave.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.540
Don't get me wrong Tabby Chan, times are tough.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.540
The president is a fascist.

09:19.540 --> 09:23.540
I think this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.540
But if it comes to smashing, you're gonna want allies.

09:26.540 --> 09:31.540
And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory,

09:31.540 --> 09:36.540
therefore rejecting democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.

09:36.540 --> 09:39.540
So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

09:39.540 --> 09:42.540
But capitalism is the root of the problems with our world.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.540
The whole system is broken, and voting won't change that.

09:45.540 --> 09:49.540
We don't need a Democrat, we need to end capitalism.

09:49.540 --> 09:55.540
Tabitha, capitalism is an epical world economic order.

09:55.540 --> 10:00.540
When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift

10:00.540 --> 10:03.540
in global politics that is so much bigger than all of us

10:03.540 --> 10:07.540
that I don't really understand what course of action you're recommending.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.540
Like before capitalism there was feudalism, and feudalism ended

10:11.540 --> 10:16.540
over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production,

10:16.540 --> 10:21.540
not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.

10:21.540 --> 10:26.540
So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?

10:26.540 --> 10:29.540
I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished

10:29.540 --> 10:31.540
by a small group of activists.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.540
And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you,

10:34.540 --> 10:37.540
but the vast majority of Americans are not communists.

10:37.540 --> 10:41.540
I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated sense

10:41.540 --> 10:43.540
of how big and important they are.

10:43.540 --> 10:48.540
I fell prey to it myself, like I was so sure that Bernie was gonna win the primary,

10:48.540 --> 10:51.540
in part because when I looked at my timeline,

10:51.540 --> 10:54.540
I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support for Bernie

10:54.540 --> 10:56.540
and contempt for the mainstream Dems.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.540
But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds,

10:59.540 --> 11:04.540
is a finely curated and very unrepresentative sample of the population.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.540
You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.

11:08.540 --> 11:13.540
Most users rarely tweet, and 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.

11:13.540 --> 11:17.540
So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans,

11:17.540 --> 11:19.540
and it's not a representative 2%.

11:19.540 --> 11:23.540
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population

11:23.540 --> 11:27.540
in that they're on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats,

11:27.540 --> 11:29.540
more educated, and a higher income.

11:29.540 --> 11:33.540
And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller,

11:33.540 --> 11:37.540
even more unrepresentative sample within a sample.

11:37.540 --> 11:40.540
We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.540
And that less than 0.1% does have an outsized influence

11:43.540 --> 11:45.540
because they're prolific tweeters,

11:45.540 --> 11:48.540
and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.540
Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture,

11:51.540 --> 11:55.540
even though cancel culture is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.540
So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians

11:58.540 --> 12:02.540
cater to this retrograde soft conservatism,

12:02.540 --> 12:04.540
you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

12:04.540 --> 12:08.540
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign,

12:08.540 --> 12:12.540
and I enraged people's dogs by knocking on their doors

12:12.540 --> 12:15.540
and ruined their dinners with canvassing phone calls.

12:15.540 --> 12:19.540
And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election,

12:19.540 --> 12:23.540
even though it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.540
You know, you do have to listen to a lot of

12:25.540 --> 12:30.540
I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.

12:30.540 --> 12:34.540
Okay, Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama's not sending his death panels

12:34.540 --> 12:37.540
out to your landscaping business, but whatever.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.540
Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities

12:39.540 --> 12:42.540
of what your fellow Americans actually care about.

12:42.540 --> 12:45.540
And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

12:45.540 --> 12:47.540
I talked to union families,

12:47.540 --> 12:50.540
but I don't think I talked to a single communist.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.540
You know, most people do not read theory.

12:52.540 --> 12:57.540
Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their families.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.540
They want personal security and prosperity.

12:59.540 --> 13:03.540
And if you look at the talking points used by politicians, they reflect that.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.540
It's why the right hammer's on about Antifa so much.

13:06.540 --> 13:07.540
Because it works.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.540
Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.540
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots,

13:13.540 --> 13:15.540
it scares the shit out of people.

13:15.540 --> 13:17.540
Of course, in reality, Antifa is not scary.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.540
Like, I've met Antifa.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.540
And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

13:23.540 --> 13:28.540
It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends.

13:28.540 --> 13:33.540
But look, if what you want is socialism, or even just social democracy,

13:33.540 --> 13:36.540
then you have a lot of work ahead of you in terms of outreach.

13:36.540 --> 13:40.540
You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.540
But you don't want to do that,

13:42.540 --> 13:44.540
because it requires that you stop owning the libs,

13:44.540 --> 13:46.540
and start actually communicating with them.

13:46.540 --> 13:50.540
You have to build alliances with like, Facebook moms,

13:50.540 --> 13:52.540
who ask ignorant questions like,

13:52.540 --> 13:54.540
what's indigenous people's day?

13:54.540 --> 13:58.540
And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the height of praxis,

13:58.540 --> 14:01.540
and who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.540
You know, you can't let your radical queer friends

14:03.540 --> 14:06.540
catch you associating with mainstream normie libs.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.540
How very bourgeois.

14:08.540 --> 14:13.540
But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

14:13.540 --> 14:18.540
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution

14:18.540 --> 14:20.540
and overthrow the US government.

14:20.540 --> 14:23.540
That's very valid.

14:23.540 --> 14:26.540
That's super hecking valid.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.540
That's extremely valid.

14:29.540 --> 14:32.540
I mean, I guess I admire the ambition.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.540
Just a couple quick follow-up questions though.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.540
Are you counting on the US military and police

14:37.540 --> 14:39.540
taking the side of the communists,

14:39.540 --> 14:41.540
or is your plan to overpower them?

14:41.540 --> 14:44.540
Because unless you know something about the military that I don't,

14:44.540 --> 14:46.540
I don't think that much of the military is going to defect

14:46.540 --> 14:48.540
to join a communist revolution.

14:48.540 --> 14:51.540
So, there will have to be a war.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.540
You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight.

14:53.540 --> 14:58.540
After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from 1917 to 1923,

14:58.540 --> 15:01.540
so you are going to need to raise a Red Army.

15:01.540 --> 15:04.540
I mean, you can't have a communist revolution without a Red Army, right?

15:04.540 --> 15:06.540
So, how's that going, Tabitha?

15:06.540 --> 15:09.540
How many weapons have you amassed?

15:09.540 --> 15:11.540
How many units have you trained?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.540
Why are we talking about this?

15:13.540 --> 15:15.540
Why am I even entertaining this notion?

15:15.540 --> 15:18.540
You know, when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government,

15:18.540 --> 15:20.540
they actually mean it.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.540
And you know they mean it because they have literal militias,

15:22.540 --> 15:25.540
the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys.

15:25.540 --> 15:28.540
They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.540
They have ex-military men in their ranks,

15:30.540 --> 15:33.540
and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.

15:33.540 --> 15:37.540
Whereas, when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter,

15:37.540 --> 15:40.540
it strikes me as ideation, not intent.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.540
You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between

15:43.540 --> 15:45.540
two kinds of suicidal thinking.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.540
So, there's intent, which is when you have a plan

15:48.540 --> 15:50.540
for how you're going to do it,

15:50.540 --> 15:53.540
and then they have to commit you because you're a danger to yourself.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.540
And then there's ideation, which is, you know,

15:55.540 --> 15:57.540
you're not actually going to do it,

15:57.540 --> 16:00.540
you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,

16:00.540 --> 16:02.540
I just want to die.

16:02.540 --> 16:04.540
There's no more joy for me left in this world.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.540
I just can't stand it anymore.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.540
I just want to end it all.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.540
And then my psychiatrist says,

16:10.540 --> 16:13.540
Well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.540
And I say,

16:15.540 --> 16:17.540
Not again, doctor.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.540
Not again.

16:18.540 --> 16:22.540
So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

16:22.540 --> 16:24.540
whereas left-wing radical discourse

16:24.540 --> 16:28.540
often amounts to revolutionary ideation.

16:28.540 --> 16:32.540
It's a kind of fantasy escapism, an alternative to politics.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.540
Well, you can't plan a revolution.

16:35.540 --> 16:39.540
Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.540
Yeah, so, a riot is the language of the unheard.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.540
But what kind of language is it?

16:44.540 --> 16:47.540
What is the point of speaking through a riot,

16:47.540 --> 16:49.540
or a protest, or a strike?

16:49.540 --> 16:53.540
Is it just emotional expression, like an angry diary entry?

16:53.540 --> 16:56.540
Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?

16:56.540 --> 16:57.540
Heard by whomst?

16:57.540 --> 16:58.540
Who are you trying to persuade?

16:58.540 --> 17:00.540
The glob glob glob glob?

17:00.540 --> 17:04.540
No, you want to be heard by the people with the power to change things.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.540
So it matters whether the people with power are likely to listen.

17:07.540 --> 17:11.540
This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements in history.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.540
And what has that accomplished?

17:13.540 --> 17:15.540
Well, at the moment, we have a president

17:15.540 --> 17:17.540
promising to double down on law and order,

17:17.540 --> 17:19.540
on military police suppression,

17:19.540 --> 17:21.540
a president who told a room full of cops

17:21.540 --> 17:24.540
not to be too gentle with the people they arrest.

17:24.540 --> 17:28.540
And when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon,

17:28.540 --> 17:29.540
you just see them thrown in.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.540
Rough.

17:30.540 --> 17:33.540
I said, please don't be too nice.

17:33.540 --> 17:34.540
And let's be clear.

17:34.540 --> 17:38.540
Both Biden and Copmola have an ugly record

17:38.540 --> 17:39.540
when it comes to crime and policing.

17:39.540 --> 17:42.540
For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing,

17:42.540 --> 17:44.540
which is the opposite of what we need right now.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.540
I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.540
But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse

17:49.540 --> 17:51.540
about policing and criminal justice.

17:51.540 --> 17:55.540
And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.540
This year's Democratic platform includes things like

17:57.540 --> 17:59.540
stricter use of force standards,

17:59.540 --> 18:00.540
banning chokeholds,

18:00.540 --> 18:02.540
restricting qualified immunity,

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
creating a registry of police misconduct,

18:04.540 --> 18:06.540
limiting no-knock warrants,

18:06.540 --> 18:08.540
decriminalizing weed,

18:08.540 --> 18:10.540
investing in crime prevention and social work.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
And is that good enough?

18:11.540 --> 18:13.540
No, it's not good enough.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.540
But it's a start.

18:14.540 --> 18:15.540
It's progress.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.540
It shows that the Democrats

18:17.540 --> 18:19.540
are at least willing to listen to protests.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.540
When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,

18:22.540 --> 18:24.540
he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill

18:24.540 --> 18:26.540
because that would have been super unpopular

18:26.540 --> 18:27.540
with the Southern Democrats.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.540
But then 1963 happened,

18:29.540 --> 18:32.540
and there were protests and uprisings all over the South

18:32.540 --> 18:34.540
and the March on Washington that summer.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.540
And Kennedy listened.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.540
The events in Birmingham and elsewhere

18:38.540 --> 18:42.540
have so increased the cries for equality

18:42.540 --> 18:46.540
that no city or state or legislative body

18:46.540 --> 18:48.540
can prudently choose to ignore them.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.540
He was moved by the protests,

18:50.540 --> 18:52.540
and he responded by introducing

18:52.540 --> 18:55.540
what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

18:55.540 --> 18:58.540
But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?

18:58.540 --> 19:00.540
What if some fascist had been president?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.540
What if Trump had been president?

19:02.540 --> 19:04.540
We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.540
So it does matter who's president.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.540
It actually matters a lot.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.540
And please, Tabby Chun,

19:12.540 --> 19:15.540
do not let a fascist win to own the libs.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.540
Goddamn it.

19:16.540 --> 19:19.540
All right, fam, let's open a new tab.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.540
Go to vote.gov and enter your state.

19:22.540 --> 19:24.540
And yeah, I know this is boring,

19:24.540 --> 19:26.540
but I'm trying to think about the tantrum

19:26.540 --> 19:29.540
Trump is gonna throw when an entire nation rejects him,

19:29.540 --> 19:32.540
and I'm letting that motivate me.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.540
In some states, you can still register,

19:34.540 --> 19:36.540
so register now if you still haven't.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.540
If you're voting in person,

19:38.540 --> 19:41.540
go to vote.org and find your polling place

19:41.540 --> 19:44.540
and make a plan for how you're gonna get there.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.540
Make sure your phone's charged,

19:46.540 --> 19:48.540
and you might want to bring some snacks

19:48.540 --> 19:50.540
or even some friends.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.540
If you're like me, you need to set an alarm

19:52.540 --> 19:54.540
so you don't forget,

19:54.540 --> 19:57.540
and then just try not to get inconsolably high

19:57.540 --> 19:59.540
until after you've placed your vote.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.540
Because we've all been living through a year of hell,

20:02.540 --> 20:05.540
and I, for one, think that we all deserve

20:05.540 --> 20:09.540
to begin 2021 by collectively purging from our lives

20:09.540 --> 20:13.540
this swindling, pestilent doofus.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.540
Vote him out!

20:15.540 --> 20:18.540
The increase of his government

20:18.540 --> 20:22.540
and his view of the new era

20:22.540 --> 20:25.540
and the birth of a new day

20:25.540 --> 20:29.540
did not mean that his government

20:29.540 --> 20:34.540
did not change the judgment of the United States.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.540
It gave me a feeling of hope

20:38.540 --> 20:41.540
that one day we'll see

20:41.540 --> 20:44.540
a little lost testimony.

20:44.540 --> 20:48.540
Next, I shall not dare

20:48.540 --> 20:51.540
to destroy your world.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.540
I shall not

20:54.540 --> 20:57.540
destroy your world.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.540
I shall not

21:00.540 --> 21:04.540
destroy your world.

21:04.540 --> 21:08.540
For I know the thoughts that I've made words

21:08.540 --> 21:13.540
for tears, for words, for thoughts, for pieces.

21:13.540 --> 21:18.540
I will destroy

21:18.540 --> 21:22.540
your world

21:22.540 --> 21:26.540
I shall not destroy

21:26.540 --> 21:31.540
your world.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.540
I shall not

21:34.540 --> 21:37.540
destroy

21:37.540 --> 21:41.540
your world.

21:41.540 --> 21:45.540
I will take away

21:45.540 --> 21:49.540
the sins of the world.

21:49.540 --> 21:53.540
I shall take away

21:53.540 --> 21:57.540
the sins of the world.

21:57.540 --> 22:01.540
I shall take away

22:01.540 --> 22:05.540
the knowledge of the Lord

22:05.540 --> 22:09.540
as the waters cover the sea.

22:09.540 --> 22:15.540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

22:15.540 --> 22:18.540
So give me peace,

22:18.540 --> 22:22.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.540
Give me your love,

22:25.540 --> 22:28.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

22:28.540 --> 22:32.540
Give me your love,

22:32.540 --> 22:35.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

22:35.540 --> 22:39.540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.540
So give me your love,

22:42.540 --> 22:46.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

22:46.540 --> 22:50.540
Give me your love,

22:50.540 --> 22:54.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.540
Give me your love,

22:58.540 --> 23:02.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

23:02.540 --> 23:06.540
We are the children of the knowledge,

23:06.540 --> 23:10.540
the knowledge of the Lord

23:10.540 --> 23:14.540
as the waters cover the sea.

23:14.540 --> 23:18.540
For I know the thoughts that I thank the Lord to give his safety for.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.540
So give me your love,

23:22.540 --> 23:26.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.

23:26.540 --> 23:30.540
Give me your love,

23:30.540 --> 23:34.540
so that I may be able to give you peace.
