0	17400	The following program is a work of fiction, created for educational, artistic, and harm
17400	21720	reduction purposes, in compliance with the Videocorp Terms of Service.
21720	23280	I love Videocorp.
23280	24800	I love the rules.
24800	28800	Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.
29400	32880	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
32880	34120	T.S. Natalie Wynn.
34120	35120	War?
35120	44120	What is it good for?
44120	50240	Absolutely gwad-sam-everything, according to the National Institute for Strategic American
50240	53840	Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity Commerce Policy Research.
53840	56640	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson.
56640	61680	You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say, it only matters
61680	63520	that you say.
63520	69480	We don't discriminate here between what is true or false, or even downright dangerous.
69480	71720	That's none of my business.
71720	73600	It's none of America's business.
73600	77440	The important thing is that you never stop talking.
77440	82000	Because that's what freedom is all about.
82000	85080	Tonight, the war on drugs.
85080	90320	How do we get these god damn junkies off the streets?
90320	94560	Jackie.
94560	101920	My first guest is Justine Tablo, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize
101920	105240	Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.
105240	108280	The editor chooses the title, I didn't choose the title.
108280	114680	And my second guest is Virginia Lam, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.
114680	116960	Virginia, let's begin with you.
116960	123100	Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese
123100	128600	Fentavoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little
128600	130200	minds on hype.
130200	137680	The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.
137680	140520	How have we reached this point?
140520	142720	Two words, Jackie.
142720	145960	Sexual anarchy.
145960	147080	Let that sink in.
147080	148960	Let what sink in?
148960	150360	Sexual anarchy?
150360	151360	What does that even mean?
151360	154760	Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.
154760	159840	The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with
159840	161080	aimless fornication.
161080	166400	They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.
166960	174640	That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel-culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.
174640	179480	The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.
179480	184040	And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in
184040	187040	America, the Christian majority.
187040	193440	Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?
193480	195240	Of course, Jackie.
195240	197160	Religious liberties are under attack.
197160	202200	We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in
202200	208200	public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral
208200	214000	bathrooms and drag queen story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working
214000	217080	power of the precious blood of the Lamb.
217080	221480	Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country, I'm sorry that you feel offended
221480	222480	by it.
222520	226800	And believe it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever
226800	229720	twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity.
229720	235000	Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children, and if you speak out
235000	238400	against the grooming, they call you a bigot.
238400	243680	Parents get no say anymore, they're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns
243680	246880	about the deviant lifestyles promoted in schools.
246880	251080	You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.
251200	253600	That's the real agenda here.
253600	255520	Sexual indoctrination.
255520	263360	This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the
263360	271360	remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,
271360	273680	or worse, Episcopalians.
273680	274680	No.
274680	276360	No, I won't stand for that.
276360	279080	I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?
279080	281000	Well, everything.
281000	283320	Addiction and sexual brokenness?
283320	289400	These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.
289400	294320	Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.
294320	296440	Is anyone going to ask me what I think?
296440	300720	Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted
300720	301720	hate preacher?
301720	304960	Well, God has nothing to do with hate.
304960	306720	Christ is the definition of love.
306840	310240	Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia, I'm talking about you.
310240	314600	Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?
314600	318880	You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.
318880	319880	Exactly.
319880	324560	Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once, and have a calm, rational
324560	328280	conversation with people who have different opinions?
328280	331440	Okay, well, let's see how that goes.
331480	337400	Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness
337400	340200	and protect the rights of children.
340200	345360	Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative
345360	348280	therapy that will make them whole again.
348280	349720	Reparative therapy?
349720	354360	You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?
354360	359880	What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken
359920	363200	and polluted and they need God to make them whole.
363200	366960	You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.
366960	369720	Are you cancel-culturing me right now?
369720	372760	Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing you right now.
372760	375240	Are you thought-policing me?
375240	378960	No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing everyone else.
378960	380800	You're saying it should be a thought crime?
380800	383800	You're saying that I'm a thought criminal?
383800	388200	Just because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage between a
388200	391560	man and a woman who form a covenant before God who gave his only begotten son to wash
391560	394120	away the sins of the world when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later
394120	395800	all glory to his name.
395800	399480	Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.
399480	402840	And I'm sure the blue check twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say
402840	404080	anything anymore.
404080	409200	And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.
409200	412240	You know who's really being silenced?
412240	414800	People who are silent.
414800	418040	Being silent is a big part of being silenced.
418040	420480	That's what being silenced means.
420480	422600	So who's really being silenced?
422600	424720	Not people on podcasts.
424720	429600	Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced
429600	430600	they are.
430600	431600	No.
431600	436120	The people who are silenced are people we never hear from.
436120	441960	Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough, they are silenced.
441960	443400	People in prison.
443400	445480	Queer teenagers in conservative towns.
445480	449080	The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.
449080	451800	Not you, Miss America.
451800	453920	Not you, Mother Superior.
453920	455740	You're not silenced.
455740	458480	You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.
458480	461240	So you defend your right to say it.
461240	467200	Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the n-word?
467200	469440	Why do you want to say the n-word?
469440	476920	So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?
476920	477920	Goddammit, Jackson.
477920	485600	Um, that sounds a little bit like being silenced.
485600	486600	She's stonewalling me.
486600	492360	All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain
492360	498720	that there's certain words they just can't say because of the color of their skin.
498720	504240	Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.
504240	505240	Would he?
505240	508160	I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.
508160	512080	Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the gospel?
512080	513080	That's not the topic.
513080	518640	I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion
518640	522080	for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.
522080	527440	You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the pride parade, doing all this
527520	532960	sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,
533520	538960	I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,
538960	540160	and I feel for them.
540160	541040	I really do.
541040	546640	Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.
546640	551600	You know, what Jew people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate,
551600	555920	but all you're really doing is calling into question the worthiness of other people's lives.
555920	559680	Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?
560480	562560	Whatever happened to love your neighbor?
562560	568400	Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that they know.
568960	572880	But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.
572880	575520	And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just
575520	580320	bow down to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.
580320	585920	It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed
585920	589840	that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore,
589840	595280	that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats
595280	600240	imposing their queer ideology, which says that if your child comes home from school
600240	603280	and announces she's a different gender this week,
603280	606960	then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife,
607520	610720	slicing up tiny little children's bodies.
611440	612640	That's where this is headed.
613200	615280	The Shrine of Moloch.
615280	618720	Oh my God, no one is slicing up children's bodies.
618720	621040	What are you talking about, you absolute lunatic?
621040	625920	Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure,
626560	633600	I feel I should let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.
633600	636640	Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?
637280	638320	Or should I say...
639440	640080	Justin.
640800	643120	Oh come on, really?
645200	646800	All right, now we're doing this.
646800	661840	Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?
662800	665520	Is this a throwback to the 1970s?
665600	669360	No, it's a throw forward to the 20-I-don't-give-a-fucks.
669360	671200	Well, don't mind if I do.
674880	678000	Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.
678960	680400	Good Virginia tobacco.
680400	680960	Jackie?
680960	683920	The Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sale or use of cigarettes,
683920	687360	vaporizers, or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.
687360	689520	Some restrictions apply, results may vary.
689520	692720	Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.
692720	697520	I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today,
697520	702480	and I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.
702480	707680	Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.
707680	711360	Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,
711360	715920	then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.
716800	717600	Excuse me?
718480	722560	I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.
722560	724160	I'm a libertarian.
724160	726480	Anything goes, baby USA.
726480	732000	Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.
732640	737440	Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage,
737440	738800	it would be a free-for-all.
738800	740240	And now, here we are.
740800	744400	96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.
744400	747680	It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve,
747680	753680	not Adam and Eve and Kai and Jaden and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.
754240	758240	Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism,
758240	763760	and from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.
763760	765440	And that's the real agenda here.
765440	768240	These people want to lower the age of consent
768240	771920	and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,
772560	776560	and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.
776560	778800	Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it,
778800	781840	why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses
781840	784240	back to the nunnery in old Missouri?
784240	787520	Do they not have demons to slay in the back country?
787520	792000	I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness,
792000	796000	for the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.
796000	801680	Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.
801680	803040	We're living in Orwell's nightmare,
803040	806160	but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.
806240	807040	Amazing.
807040	810800	Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions
810800	814480	can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation.
814480	814960	Wow.
814960	815920	Cheers to us.
816560	817200	Is it great?
818000	819680	You know, I don't think it's that great,
819680	822720	and I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you
822720	825840	sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people,
825840	828000	something you know absolutely nothing about.
828560	830560	Oh, I know more than you might think.
831360	833600	I used to be homosexual.
833840	838320	No, God, no, I'm not doing this today.
838320	841680	I'm sorry, you used to be homosexual?
841680	842880	That's right, Jackie.
842880	844000	Before I was saved.
844000	844640	Here we go.
844640	846240	I used to be a lesbian.
846240	847520	That's who I thought I was.
847520	849760	I lived that lifestyle.
849760	851760	You used to be a lesbian.
851760	854800	Okay, name five things you love about men.
854800	855680	This should be good.
856240	857440	Gather round, everyone.
857440	859040	Let's all witness the power of Christ.
859040	861040	I'm sure this will be very convincing.
861040	865360	I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.
865360	867360	He commands me to be holy.
867360	869920	Fear not, you will no longer live in shame,
870640	874000	for your creator will be your husband.
874560	877040	Okay, well, if you want to be the bride of Christ,
877040	880640	then by all means, but you know, keep it in the bedroom.
880640	883040	I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face.
883040	885040	Virginia, I'm confused.
885040	887280	I thought people are just born that way.
887280	889920	Like, Jesus can't change that.
889920	893040	Jackie, the mainstream media establishment
893040	896880	doesn't want you to know that people like me exist
896880	899280	because that goes against their narrative.
899280	903600	But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.
903600	908160	The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.
908720	910640	But what if every addict said,
910640	912640	well, I'm just a junkie.
912640	914160	That's who I am.
914160	919600	I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.
919600	921200	Well, that's a good point.
921200	923040	Uh, no, it isn't.
923040	925360	Gay is just a feeling.
925360	927040	Homosexual lust?
927040	928400	Same-sex temptation?
928960	931600	That's a feeling, not an identity.
932160	934160	Like, maybe you struggle with wrath,
934160	937040	but you don't identify as wrathful.
937040	939200	Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.
939200	940720	I want to punch you in the face.
940720	943120	And yet, you haven't punched me.
943120	948240	Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.
948720	952880	When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,
952880	955920	and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.
956640	959600	My old self has been crucified with Christ.
959600	962720	It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.
963440	966000	But before I made God Lord of my desires,
966000	968000	I was controlled by sin.
968560	969280	By drugs?
969920	970960	By alcohol?
970960	972560	By homosexuality?
972560	975520	So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.
975520	977680	Wow, behold the power of Christ.
977760	981360	You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?
981920	982480	Yes, I do.
983440	984400	It's pretty cool.
984400	987920	I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.
987920	989760	Is this a joke to you?
990560	992240	Do you find this humorous?
992240	992720	Yeah.
992720	993360	I don't.
993920	998320	Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,
998320	1001680	where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin,
1001680	1004240	away from God, shut out from grace,
1004960	1008160	tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.
1012160	1014960	Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.
1014960	1017920	Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?
1018560	1021840	Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?
1021840	1023280	That's right, Jackie.
1023280	1024720	What were you addicted to?
1024720	1025520	Miracle Whip?
1026320	1027200	VeggieTales?
1027760	1029200	Communion wafers, maybe?
1029200	1032400	No, I was addicted to alcohol.
1033120	1034160	To pornography.
1034960	1036480	To lusting after women.
1037440	1038960	And to hype.
1039680	1040000	Hype?
1040960	1044560	You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?
1044560	1047760	Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?
1047760	1050080	Because I am intrigued.
1050080	1051840	Jackie, I would love to testify.
1052480	1056800	You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.
1056800	1057840	Girl, not this.
1057840	1060400	When I left home, I was lost.
1060400	1061840	I was a wretch.
1061840	1063360	I was on fire.
1063360	1064640	And I rebuke that fire.
1065440	1067120	I used foul language.
1067120	1068960	I went out clubbing.
1068960	1070320	I cut my hair off.
1070320	1071280	I gained weight.
1071840	1074800	I was tempted by same-sex attraction.
1074800	1077600	And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?
1077600	1079440	I was always a little more masculine.
1080000	1083040	I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.
1083040	1085040	I used to shoot up testosterone.
1085040	1086720	That's why my voice is a little lower.
1086720	1088480	Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same.
1088480	1090560	Honestly, if I didn't know,
1090560	1092720	I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.
1092720	1095200	Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.
1095840	1098400	Though if anything, this one's the man.
1098400	1100320	He's the one injecting testosterone.
1100320	1103440	God has healed the feminine within me.
1104240	1106800	All along, God was tugging at my heart.
1107440	1111120	But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.
1111760	1114960	I felt a terrible void inside.
1115520	1117280	I lived in the flesh.
1117280	1119840	I lived in sin with another woman,
1119840	1121760	hoping to satisfy that hunger.
1121760	1122560	Here we go.
1122560	1124240	When I gazed upon her beauty,
1124240	1127040	I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.
1128240	1130640	But the light I saw was nothing
1130640	1133120	but the fire of my own wickedness.
1133680	1136400	I knew that lifestyle was wrong.
1137360	1141200	But I couldn't quit until she broke my heart.
1142160	1147040	And then, I was cast into the outer darkness.
1147840	1150160	Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.
1150160	1152400	It was like a part of me was ripped away
1153440	1156080	and I was left to face my brokenness alone.
1156880	1158720	Well, was she a Capricorn?
1158720	1160400	No, a Sagittarius.
1160400	1161520	Well, there's your problem.
1162240	1164080	Next time, maybe try a water sign.
1164080	1165840	Shh, stop interrupting.
1166560	1167760	I'm living for the drama.
1167760	1169280	Jackie, I was alone.
1170000	1171120	I was suicidal.
1171680	1172640	I was an addict.
1173200	1174080	I was lost.
1174960	1179280	Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.
1180160	1183760	And I was surrounded by these women singing.
1184880	1186720	What can wash away my sin?
1187360	1189120	What can make me whole again?
1189840	1191840	Nothing but the blood of Jesus
1192560	1195120	that washes white as snow.
1196080	1199680	And I felt this tingling all over my body.
1199680	1203280	And I knew I was hearing the voice of God
1203280	1205360	for the very first time.
1205360	1207280	Not just the words of the hymn,
1207280	1211200	but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.
1211200	1213120	Yes, we all like music.
1213120	1215120	And suddenly, my pain made sense.
1216000	1218320	I don't have to live this way anymore.
1218320	1222640	In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.
1222640	1223920	I was cleansed.
1224480	1225600	I was healed.
1225600	1226640	I was delivered.
1226640	1228000	I was sanctified.
1228000	1229040	I was redeemed.
1229680	1232160	My guilty stains were washed away,
1232160	1234960	and I exchanged my brokenness and pain
1234960	1236480	for his loving grace.
1237520	1241440	Okay, so I'm confused.
1241440	1242560	Do you eat dick now?
1243520	1244320	What's your deal?
1244320	1248080	Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room
1248080	1249440	with a repentant heart
1249440	1252080	and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.
1252640	1254080	When I found Jesus,
1254080	1257200	I found someone who truly loves me.
1257200	1258960	And through obedience to him,
1259600	1263200	my identity is no longer in my attractions,
1263200	1264080	but in Christ.
1264880	1266480	You know what I think, Virginia?
1266480	1268960	I think that you are immoderate in love
1268960	1271040	and immoderate with substances.
1271040	1273520	And so you need an imaginary father figure
1273520	1274720	to make all the rules
1274720	1277120	because you can't control yourself.
1277120	1279920	But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else
1279920	1283120	should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.
1283120	1284320	Mental infancy?
1285200	1288720	Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.
1288720	1292160	I know, Justin, the chains of sin.
1292160	1295920	I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh,
1295920	1299040	the itch, the ache, the shame.
1299040	1300320	I lived in mud.
1300320	1301840	I lived in filth.
1301840	1304800	I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,
1304800	1307200	the great whirlwind that whips sinners
1307200	1309920	round an endless wheel of pain.
1309920	1312960	But my shame was hammered to the cross
1312960	1315120	for those who belong to Christ
1315120	1318400	have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
1320160	1323280	Virginia, who are you trying to impress
1323280	1327600	with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?
1327600	1331200	Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?
1331200	1331700	God?
1332480	1334080	I really don't think he cares, Gorge.
1334640	1337440	Celibacy is not a good deed.
1337440	1340000	To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say
1340000	1342480	that you're gay and you hate yourself.
1343360	1346160	I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.
1346160	1349120	Is it hate to worship the glory of God
1349120	1350400	over the glory of self?
1350400	1351280	Where's my nail?
1351280	1354160	Is it hate to be anchored to the savior's will
1354160	1355840	that leads me from temptation?
1355840	1356400	Damn it.
1356400	1359280	To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity
1359280	1360320	of who God made me?
1360320	1361360	I don't have my goddamn nail.
1361360	1364320	Is it hate to heal the brokenness
1364320	1366560	and be made whole through radical obedience
1366560	1367760	to the Holy Spirit?
1367760	1369520	Have you been made whole, Virginia?
1370160	1372480	Because to me, it sounds like you amputate
1372480	1376080	half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame.
1376080	1379920	Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.
1379920	1383440	Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?
1383440	1384400	She's hilarious.
1384400	1385200	She's a wit.
1385200	1388080	We are all half angel and half beast.
1388080	1392160	The flesh must die so the spirit may live.
1392160	1394720	The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.
1395280	1398240	Have you really wandered so far astray?
1398240	1402320	Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom
1402320	1405600	that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?
1405600	1407760	No, Virginia, that's not what I think.
1408400	1411680	What I think is that you have a vulgar,
1411680	1414880	cracker barrel understanding of human sexuality
1414880	1418000	and you're on a save the children type moral crusade
1418000	1420880	because you lack the adult capacity
1420880	1423200	to face the demons in your own head.
1423200	1427280	You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.
1427280	1429600	Well, what even is that, Virginia?
1430160	1431840	I want specifics.
1431840	1435520	What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do
1435520	1438720	if Jesus stops holding your hand for 10 minutes?
1438720	1442080	What, you think you're gonna rail a line of hype
1442080	1443120	off a stripper's tits?
1443760	1444560	Excuse me?
1444560	1445520	Answer this.
1445520	1449120	What do you think erotic love is a desire for?
1449120	1450480	Wait, I know this one.
1452480	1453200	Sex.
1453200	1455440	No, that's too easy.
1456240	1460240	Erotic love is not aimless pleasure seeking.
1460240	1465520	It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,
1466320	1470480	to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,
1471200	1473040	to liberate repressed energy,
1473040	1474320	to feel alive.
1475440	1477120	Love is not the flesh.
1477680	1479280	It's not temptation.
1479840	1482880	It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.
1482880	1485200	It's nothing like being an alcoholic.
1485200	1486880	It's not a craving.
1487600	1489120	It's a yearning.
1490560	1493920	The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.
1494800	1497040	But you people don't understand that
1497040	1500400	because you are vulgarians.
1500400	1502000	You have no sense of humanity
1502560	1504480	and you have no sense of the erotic.
1504480	1509120	Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal Marxist bullcrap.
1509120	1512880	Jackie, your brain is so small.
1513680	1514800	It's just so tiny.
1515840	1516320	Look at me.
1517120	1518720	You're a dum-dum, okay?
1519520	1521440	And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.
1521440	1527120	As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.
1527120	1530640	Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time
1530720	1534880	because you're so stupid and I can't stand it anymore.
1534880	1535520	So shut up.
1536880	1538640	I'm giving you the plague, liberal.
1540000	1543440	Okay, well, I hope it kills me because I'm done.
1543440	1546160	See, I'll never get sick because every day
1546160	1549120	I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.
1549680	1551760	Doctors don't want you to know about it.
1551760	1553520	I could not possibly be more done.
1553520	1556320	You may be done, but I'm not.
1556320	1558000	Well, you people never are, are you?
1558000	1559360	You want to talk about yearning?
1559920	1561360	I mean, I get it.
1561360	1562960	I used to live in shame.
1562960	1566560	I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.
1566560	1568080	Yes, we've all noticed.
1568080	1570240	Let me tell you, it is not freedom.
1570240	1571680	It is bondage.
1571680	1574960	You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.
1574960	1577280	The flesh possesses you.
1577280	1581840	Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave.
1581840	1584080	For the wages of sin is death,
1584080	1588400	but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
1588400	1591440	You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?
1591440	1595760	Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.
1595760	1597680	Only he can fill the void.
1598240	1599120	I know.
1599120	1601360	I used to be like you, Justin.
1601360	1602400	I was lost.
1602400	1603600	I was blind.
1603600	1605920	I was confused in my identity.
1605920	1610400	I used to reject the gospel until my sin took everything from me
1610400	1612400	and I needed a savior.
1612400	1615600	And then I called out to God for salvation
1615680	1618320	and he came to me as a loving father.
1619120	1621040	It's not too late for you, Justin.
1621760	1623360	You are so loved.
1624000	1625040	God loves you.
1625600	1626160	But this?
1627120	1629200	This is not God's intent for you.
1629200	1633200	It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent.
1633200	1635680	The height of cosmological narcissism.
1635680	1638080	I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?
1638640	1641120	Have we run out of fedoras in America?
1641120	1643360	I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.
1643360	1646160	I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.
1646160	1647040	God is love.
1647680	1650560	Is he the only love worth having?
1650560	1654160	What you call love, the sin I used to live in,
1654160	1656480	the world, the flesh, and the devil,
1656480	1659040	that only ever brought me pain.
1659040	1661360	Yes, because heartbreak is painful.
1662080	1663120	Love is painful.
1663680	1665280	The poets are unanimous.
1665920	1668000	Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.
1668560	1670560	Eros, giver of pain.
1670560	1671920	What's Sappho?
1671920	1673680	A pagan pornographer.
1673680	1676400	The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.
1676400	1680400	Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,
1680400	1683680	then goddammit, I don't know who can.
1683680	1685360	Well, God for one.
1685920	1688560	God has a sexual plan for all of us.
1688560	1689280	That's odd.
1689280	1692640	God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.
1693200	1696080	Men's and women's bodies fit together
1696080	1698000	for the purpose of creating children.
1698000	1700240	You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?
1700800	1704560	Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by,
1704560	1705760	even in this economy.
1705760	1706480	You have a guy?
1707360	1708640	A semen guy?
1708640	1710080	That's just most guys.
1710080	1713360	Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,
1713360	1716480	but since I'm among heathens, clearly,
1717120	1719840	I will do my best to argue not from faith,
1720400	1721760	but from reason.
1721760	1722880	I love reason.
1722880	1723440	Do you?
1723440	1725120	Tell me this, Justin.
1725120	1726720	Which is better?
1726720	1728240	A love that is eternal?
1728960	1731520	Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?
1732400	1734080	I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,
1734080	1735280	that must have been really hard.
1735280	1736800	Just answer the question.
1736800	1738240	Nothing is eternal, Virginia.
1738960	1741120	Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.
1741120	1743120	Isn't a love that is eternal
1743680	1745920	superior to a love that is fleeting?
1747200	1749520	Yes, Socrates, it is certain.
1749520	1750800	And don't you yearn?
1750800	1752960	Not just for a love in the moment,
1752960	1756000	but for a love that lasts eternity?
1756800	1758880	Yes, Socrates, that is evident.
1758880	1764640	And isn't eternal love what we call God?
1765920	1768800	Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,
1768800	1771280	but sometimes we don't get what we want.
1772880	1776080	So you have no argument.
1776080	1777200	Do I really need an argument?
1777920	1779840	This is just a semantic trick.
1779840	1782000	You're saying that God is eternal love,
1782000	1784400	and then magically that must exist
1784400	1787200	because you defined it that way?
1787200	1790800	So you don't have an argument?
1791840	1792480	I'm sorry.
1792480	1793040	Interesting.
1793040	1794560	I didn't prepare to have a debate
1794560	1797520	about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo
1797520	1799360	cosplaying as a trad wife.
1799360	1801440	I'm supposed to take this seriously?
1801440	1801940	Why?
1802560	1803360	Why am I even here?
1803360	1804000	What am I doing?
1804000	1805360	Why am I talking to these people?
1805360	1810160	I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.
1810160	1812800	I don't think God leads people to podcasts.
1812800	1816160	Clearly, this transgender identity of yours
1816160	1819360	is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.
1819920	1822080	There's a hunger in your soul.
1822640	1825040	No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.
1825840	1828720	Do you not feel the thirst in your body
1829360	1831040	like a parched land?
1831040	1833600	Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.
1833600	1835360	I'm sure we all feel the thirst.
1835360	1837280	If I may quote Psalm 63.
1837280	1838000	Please don't.
1838000	1839840	You, God, are my God.
1840480	1842480	Earnestly, I seek you.
1842480	1844240	I thirst for you.
1844240	1846560	My whole being longs for you
1846560	1849920	in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
1850560	1853600	Because your love is better than life,
1854240	1856240	my lips will glorify you.
1856880	1859680	I will praise you as long as I live.
1860560	1863520	And in your name, I will raise up my hands.
1864080	1868560	I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods.
1869200	1872560	With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.
1874080	1877040	Virginia, go to therapy.
1877040	1879920	Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.
1879920	1881680	You're the one who needs to go to therapy.
1881680	1882800	Now you go to therapy.
1883440	1884640	I'll pray for you.
1884640	1885920	I'll pray for you.
1885920	1887680	I will pray straight to Satan.
1887680	1891440	Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little Looney Tunes?
1892320	1894080	You have your Jesus bullshit.
1894880	1897120	You have your gender nonsense.
1897120	1901360	And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.
1901360	1902960	The free market, right.
1903680	1906240	We all have our little delusions.
1906240	1909200	The important thing is that we cling to them
1909200	1913680	and we never let go no matter how much evidence gets in the way.
1913680	1915840	Because that's what makes us free.
1916480	1919920	And freedom is what makes America great.
1919920	1922560	Other countries, they don't have choices.
1923200	1928160	But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.
1928880	1930320	So can we do drugs?
1930320	1932240	No, that's illegal.
1932240	1933680	I thought you said we could choose.
1933680	1936640	Yes, but we have to make the right choices.
1936640	1939200	And what if we want to make the wrong choices?
1939200	1942400	Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.
1942400	1947440	You will be locked in a tiny cage that is literally the opposite of freedom.
1947440	1949440	Well, we have to be tough on crime.
1950000	1951840	It's the only way to keep this country free.
1951840	1954240	We have to build more prisons.
1955520	1957920	Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?
1957920	1959600	Well, Father decides.
1959600	1961120	Father always decides.
1961120	1963280	And do you always do what Father says?
1964080	1966240	Of course, we always do what Father says.
1967280	1968080	Why?
1968080	1970000	Because Father says so.
1970000	1974640	Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?
1974640	1976160	Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.
1976160	1977200	Yes, you do.
1977200	1981200	You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.
1981200	1981760	No, I'm not.
1982480	1984720	I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.
1984720	1986480	My heart was also broken by a woman.
1987120	1988400	I thought she was a cat girl.
1989200	1990640	She turned out to be a fuckboy.
1991600	1993840	You are a straight man.
1993840	1996000	I mean, at this point, I wish.
1996720	1999440	But no, definitely a gay woman.
1999440	2000640	We're all stuck with it.
2000640	2001920	Hold on.
2001920	2006640	So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.
2006640	2009520	Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?
2009520	2010080	No.
2010160	2011520	In the mirror?
2011520	2015200	No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference
2015200	2017680	between my own reflection and a different person.
2018240	2021120	Desire is always for something that you lack.
2021760	2026000	You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.
2026640	2029280	Desire feeds on absence.
2029280	2031600	It reaches out across a void.
2031600	2032560	I don't know.
2032560	2036000	I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.
2036000	2038560	Okay, well, thank you for sharing.
2038560	2041040	Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?
2042480	2044400	Do you have bodies in your basement?
2045600	2047600	You better watch out or you're gonna be next.
2047600	2049280	Are those clothes even yours?
2049920	2052640	Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?
2052640	2057440	Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,
2057440	2058720	and I will feast upon it.
2060000	2063920	Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.
2064560	2066880	It's not enough for you to possess a woman.
2066880	2070320	You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.
2070320	2073120	Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?
2073120	2075520	You're the one who keeps bringing that up.
2075520	2076320	Nice.
2076320	2077040	Got her!
2077040	2078320	Shut up, dum-dum.
2078320	2080880	I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.
2080880	2081840	You stay out of this.
2081840	2083440	Look, so you're a straight man.
2084080	2085680	You could have had a wife.
2085680	2087840	You could have raised a family.
2087840	2090080	Your life could have meant something.
2090080	2091920	But you threw it all away?
2091920	2094880	You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?
2095520	2096720	Do you have babies?
2097280	2099440	Well, priests don't have babies.
2099440	2101280	Maybe think of queer people as priests.
2102160	2105440	Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.
2105440	2106800	Whoa, okay.
2106800	2108240	That's Catholics.
2108240	2109120	That's not Christians.
2109120	2111120	Just kind of crossing a line, don't you think?
2111120	2113040	Oh, has free speech gone too far?
2113840	2115360	Now it's gone too far.
2115360	2117520	Can we have a civil conversation, please?
2118080	2122080	Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?
2122080	2124400	Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.
2124960	2128080	Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility
2128080	2133120	by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.
2134080	2138240	I walk with the spirit until the day I go to glory.
2138240	2139680	That's my meaning.
2139680	2141280	Your meaning is what?
2141840	2146560	To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty
2146560	2149760	until you rot away unresurrected in the earth?
2149760	2150560	And for what?
2151680	2154160	To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?
2154800	2157040	Anything else would be a lie.
2157040	2161280	If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.
2161280	2164640	And with or without your approval and understanding,
2164640	2167520	I will always be the way I am.
2168240	2171760	Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?
2172640	2177680	I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.
2177680	2181920	Just leave children out of it.
2182640	2186800	Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.
2187360	2192960	And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.
2201760	2207920	Listen, Justin, I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.
2207920	2210480	I know my place in this world.
2210480	2216240	I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.
2216960	2222720	Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A$ community?
2222720	2224640	Well, obviously not.
2224640	2229360	Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.
2230080	2232720	Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.
2232720	2239840	So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl gf.
2241040	2243200	Can you honestly say that you're happy?
2244400	2245760	That you're fulfilled?
2247040	2248320	That you have purpose?
2249680	2252320	That you have hope?
2270720	2273520	Justin.
2290240	2292160	Justin.
2293840	2295760	Justin.
2296880	2299120	Justin.
2299760	2301520	Justin.
2301520	2302160	Hello?
2302160	2303200	Justin.
2303200	2304240	Hello?
2309600	2310480	Jesus!
2310480	2311840	Ha!
2311840	2313680	Don't say that name in front of me.
2313680	2315680	How did you get in my house?
2315680	2319120	Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.
2319120	2320640	Who are you?
2320640	2321600	What are you?
2321600	2325680	Well, I used to be an angel.
2325680	2327600	And now?
2327600	2332320	Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.
2332320	2337760	A satanic visitation at this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the
2337760	2341440	country, localized entirely within my bathroom?
2341440	2342720	Yes.
2342720	2345360	Is this going to be a weird sex thing?
2345360	2346880	Do you want it to be?
2346880	2347760	No.
2347760	2349280	Look, I've had a terrible day.
2349280	2351600	I'm really not in the mood for this.
2351600	2353920	Well, I can help you with that.
2353920	2355200	Can you?
2355200	2356080	Sure.
2356080	2357600	I can help with anything.
2357600	2368400	Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.
2368400	2370320	Shame?
2370320	2371920	Is it the shame?
2371920	2373920	Well, yeah, there's the shame.
2373920	2376080	There's always going to be the shame.
2376080	2377520	But it's a complex cocktail.
2377520	2380880	There's the heartbreak, there's the loneliness, the self-loathing.
2380880	2382880	I'm a parched landloose.
2382880	2384320	I've got the hunger.
2384320	2385680	The emptiness inside.
2385680	2388880	Oh, emptiness inside.
2388880	2392320	Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.
2392320	2394560	I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.
2394560	2397200	It's not a weird sex thing.
2397200	2399280	Potions, Justine.
2399280	2400480	Potions.
2400480	2404480	I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.
2404480	2405920	Potions?
2405920	2411200	Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.
2411200	2415760	Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary.
2415760	2418000	A dealer.
2418000	2420320	Are you trying to get demonetized?
2420320	2421440	Sorry.
2421440	2423520	What potions do you have?
2423520	2427520	Well, this is one of my favorites.
2427520	2430160	It's called hype.
2430160	2432240	This will make you come alive.
2432240	2434560	You'll jump right out of your shell.
2434560	2439360	Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.
2439360	2443520	You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.
2443520	2445520	You'll finally get things done.
2445520	2447920	You'll connect with people.
2447920	2451680	You'll always know just what to say.
2451680	2454720	Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.
2454720	2459200	At this point, I just want the pain to stop.
2459200	2460800	Pain?
2460800	2464640	Well, I surely have something for that.
2464640	2467600	It's called void.
2467600	2472400	One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.
2472400	2476480	The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,
2476480	2482480	the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.
2482480	2486800	All of that will fade away under a warm blanket
2486800	2491360	of serenity and love.
2491360	2495680	Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.
2495680	2498720	And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.
2498720	2502480	Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.
2502480	2505840	You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness
2505840	2509840	all alone?
2509840	2511840	What, do you need a clear mind to process
2511840	2514080	how bad you were on that podcast?
2514080	2516240	Because it was embarrassing, humiliating.
2516240	2518560	Honestly, it was difficult to watch.
2518560	2519360	Shut up.
2519360	2521520	Is it some kind of masochism?
2521520	2524320	You just want to feel all the pain, man?
2524320	2526160	Because you're not impressing anyone.
2526160	2528160	I mean, what is your plan for this evening?
2528160	2530000	You're going to sit around stalking your ex
2530000	2531840	on social media all night?
2531840	2533840	Because that is pathetic.
2533840	2536720	And it's so unnecessary, because you're
2536720	2541280	choosing to feel bad, when with one drop of void,
2541280	2545280	you can be in bliss.
2545280	2548000	Pass.
2548000	2549440	The cool kids are doing it.
2549440	2551360	The cool kids are absolutely not doing it,
2551360	2553120	because it's not the 90s.
2553120	2555760	Kids today are vaping Benadryl.
2555760	2557200	Don't you keep up with this?
2557200	2560240	OK, I mean, I respect your choice,
2560240	2563440	but I'm not going anywhere.
2563440	2565920	I will stay right here.
2565920	2568960	And I will remind you every minute,
2568960	2571520	for hundreds of consecutive minutes,
2571520	2575360	that your pain is optional.
2575360	2578880	And I have the antidote right here.
2578960	2584240	But I guess you'd just rather feel pain, and shame,
2584240	2592880	and humiliation, and heartbreak, and boredom, loneliness,
2592880	2602960	despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.
2602960	2605760	Look, I'm a smart person, OK?
2605760	2607280	And I'm not going to let you turn me
2607280	2610080	into some kind of pathetic junkie.
2610080	2611760	Pathetic?
2611760	2615840	Is it pathetic to feel good?
2615840	2620160	Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.
2620160	2624560	And to me, that's pathetic.
2624560	2633840	Well, the thing about that, it's OK.
2633840	2635440	Just give me the goddamn void.
2635440	2637840	Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.
2637840	2639920	I thought I was going to be here all night.
2639920	2641920	Well, my will is weak, OK?
2641920	2643520	Can I have the potion, please?
2643520	2646000	All right, well, let's be a little patient.
2646000	2647840	You should really do this the right way, OK?
2647840	2649520	It's called harm reduction.
2649520	2654960	What you're going to do is put one drop, and only one drop,
2654960	2658080	of pure void into water.
2658080	2659840	This is important.
2659840	2662480	Do not do too many drops.
2662480	2664560	What happens if I do too many drops?
2664560	2666720	Oh, you'll probably die.
2666720	2667920	I'll die?
2667920	2669760	I told you it was important.
2669760	2671920	Well, how many drops is too many drops?
2671920	2674160	Well, it's difficult to say exactly.
2674160	2675760	It depends on a lot of factors.
2676560	2677600	Seriously?
2677600	2680000	But it's your first time, so just do one.
2689920	2692400	So do I just drink it, or?
2692400	2693600	Of course you drink it.
2693600	2695600	It's a purely fictional magical potion,
2695600	2698560	utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.
2698560	2700160	What else would you do with it?
2700160	2700660	OK.
2711120	2711680	Good girl.
2713040	2714160	I don't feel anything.
2714160	2715760	OK, well, give it a minute.
2715760	2717920	In about 15 seconds, you are not going
2717920	2719600	to know the meaning of the word pain.
2719600	2720480	Are you ready for that?
2721440	2724960	Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.
2725760	2728240	And my goddamn...
2739680	2740800	There she goes.
2742080	2742800	Thank god.
2745840	2747280	Well, don't thank god.
2747280	2747840	Thank me.
2747840	2751600	I will not have father taking credit for my work.
2777840	2794240	Lucy?
2795760	2796260	Lucy?
2797760	2798800	Luciferia?
2800720	2801220	Mother?
2802400	2803040	A doctor?
2803920	2805200	Mother doctor?
2805200	2806000	Doctor mother?
2807120	2807600	Mom?
2808320	2809440	Mother void?
2809440	2810240	Mother void?
2812160	2812660	Yes?
2814960	2815840	Help me, doctor.
2816560	2818160	I'm being cancelled.
2818880	2822160	Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online.
2822160	2822960	So what?
2824000	2825360	You don't understand, doctor.
2826080	2827680	I'm in love with this furry.
2828640	2830560	You really are far from god.
2830560	2832640	You're further from god than I am.
2832640	2835440	Lucy, can I get a drop?
2836240	2837040	A drop.
2837840	2840560	I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.
2842160	2843760	Doctor, my pain is at a 10.
2844960	2847840	I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.
2847840	2849760	I'm a little disappointed, honestly.
2849760	2852400	I enjoy the thrill of the chase.
2852400	2854160	But there's no chase with you.
2854160	2855600	No chase at all.
2855600	2857200	You're easy.
2857200	2860160	An easy little void slut.
2860160	2861760	A slut for the void.
2862960	2866160	Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.
2866160	2869440	Please, just give me the void so I can fill the emptiness.
2870640	2874800	If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.
2874800	2877520	But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?
2878080	2879440	You call me mommy now.
2880240	2882720	Because I own you.
2883680	2885520	Yes, mommy dearest.
2956640	2960320	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.
2969760	2972160	Five drops already.
2972160	2974400	Escalating, aren't we?
2974400	2977120	Well yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.
2978240	2980080	So you're going to do five drops?
2980080	2981360	Just to take the edge off.
2982000	2985520	I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.
2986320	2991520	Oh wow, if it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.
2991520	2993600	By all means, continue.
2993600	2995200	Well, thank you for being supportive.
2996160	2998000	Cheers.
3046160	3065600	That was, that was dumb.
3067760	3068720	That was so dumb.
3068720	3081760	I need to quit.
3084320	3085520	I've got to quit.
3085520	3086320	I'm going to quit.
3088000	3090240	Oh, you're going to quit, are you?
3090240	3090960	Yes, Mother.
3092160	3093120	I'm going to quit.
3094800	3095440	Good luck.
3095760	3096720	Good luck.
3096720	3102160	I'll quit after one more drop.
3102160	3102880	Of course.
3109600	3110640	All right, that's it.
3111280	3111920	Never again.
3113920	3114480	I'm quitting.
3117840	3118320	I quit.
3118320	3122320	I quit.
3122320	3127680	It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.
3130880	3143840	How hard could that be?
3148880	3156800	No, I can't do this.
3157360	3158320	I can't do this.
3158320	3169840	Shit, shit.
3173360	3176240	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3176240	3177680	Lucy, Lucy.
3178320	3179600	Lucy, I want to sleep.
3179600	3180800	Wake up, Lucy.
3180800	3182160	Lucy, wake up.
3182160	3183840	Wake up!
3239120	3251840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3251840	3263840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3263840	3283840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3283840	3303840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3303840	3323840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3323840	3343840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3343840	3363840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3363840	3383840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3383840	3403840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3403840	3423840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
3423840	3443840	Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
