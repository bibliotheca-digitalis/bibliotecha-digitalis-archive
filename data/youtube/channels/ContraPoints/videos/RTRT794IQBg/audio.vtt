00:00.000 --> 00:17.400
The following program is a work of fiction, created for educational, artistic, and harm

00:17.400 --> 00:21.720
reduction purposes, in compliance with the Videocorp Terms of Service.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.280
I love Videocorp.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.800
I love the rules.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.800
Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.880
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.120
T.S. Natalie Wynn.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
War?

00:35.120 --> 00:44.120
What is it good for?

00:44.120 --> 00:50.240
Absolutely gwad-sam-everything, according to the National Institute for Strategic American

00:50.240 --> 00:53.840
Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity Commerce Policy Research.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.640
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.680
You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say, it only matters

01:01.680 --> 01:03.520
that you say.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.480
We don't discriminate here between what is true or false, or even downright dangerous.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.720
That's none of my business.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.600
It's none of America's business.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.440
The important thing is that you never stop talking.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.000
Because that's what freedom is all about.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.080
Tonight, the war on drugs.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.320
How do we get these god damn junkies off the streets?

01:30.320 --> 01:34.560
Jackie.

01:34.560 --> 01:41.920
My first guest is Justine Tablo, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize

01:41.920 --> 01:45.240
Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.280
The editor chooses the title, I didn't choose the title.

01:48.280 --> 01:54.680
And my second guest is Virginia Lam, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.960
Virginia, let's begin with you.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.100
Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese

02:03.100 --> 02:08.600
Fentavoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little

02:08.600 --> 02:10.200
minds on hype.

02:10.200 --> 02:17.680
The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.520
How have we reached this point?

02:20.520 --> 02:22.720
Two words, Jackie.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.960
Sexual anarchy.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.080
Let that sink in.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.960
Let what sink in?

02:28.960 --> 02:30.360
Sexual anarchy?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.360
What does that even mean?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.760
Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.840
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with

02:39.840 --> 02:41.080
aimless fornication.

02:41.080 --> 02:46.400
They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.

02:46.960 --> 02:54.640
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel-culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.480
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

02:59.480 --> 03:04.040
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in

03:04.040 --> 03:07.040
America, the Christian majority.

03:07.040 --> 03:13.440
Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?

03:13.480 --> 03:15.240
Of course, Jackie.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.160
Religious liberties are under attack.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.200
We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in

03:22.200 --> 03:28.200
public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral

03:28.200 --> 03:34.000
bathrooms and drag queen story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working

03:34.000 --> 03:37.080
power of the precious blood of the Lamb.

03:37.080 --> 03:41.480
Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country, I'm sorry that you feel offended

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
by it.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.800
And believe it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever

03:46.800 --> 03:49.720
twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity.

03:49.720 --> 03:55.000
Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children, and if you speak out

03:55.000 --> 03:58.400
against the grooming, they call you a bigot.

03:58.400 --> 04:03.680
Parents get no say anymore, they're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns

04:03.680 --> 04:06.880
about the deviant lifestyles promoted in schools.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.080
You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.600
That's the real agenda here.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.520
Sexual indoctrination.

04:15.520 --> 04:23.360
This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the

04:23.360 --> 04:31.360
remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,

04:31.360 --> 04:33.680
or worse, Episcopalians.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
No.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.360
No, I won't stand for that.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.080
I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?

04:39.080 --> 04:41.000
Well, everything.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.320
Addiction and sexual brokenness?

04:43.320 --> 04:49.400
These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.

04:49.400 --> 04:54.320
Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.440
Is anyone going to ask me what I think?

04:56.440 --> 05:00.720
Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
hate preacher?

05:01.720 --> 05:04.960
Well, God has nothing to do with hate.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.720
Christ is the definition of love.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.240
Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia, I'm talking about you.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.600
Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?

05:14.600 --> 05:18.880
You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.880
Exactly.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.560
Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once, and have a calm, rational

05:24.560 --> 05:28.280
conversation with people who have different opinions?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.440
Okay, well, let's see how that goes.

05:31.480 --> 05:37.400
Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness

05:37.400 --> 05:40.200
and protect the rights of children.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.360
Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative

05:45.360 --> 05:48.280
therapy that will make them whole again.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.720
Reparative therapy?

05:49.720 --> 05:54.360
You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

05:54.360 --> 05:59.880
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken

05:59.920 --> 06:03.200
and polluted and they need God to make them whole.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.960
You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.720
Are you cancel-culturing me right now?

06:09.720 --> 06:12.760
Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing you right now.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.240
Are you thought-policing me?

06:15.240 --> 06:18.960
No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing everyone else.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.800
You're saying it should be a thought crime?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.800
You're saying that I'm a thought criminal?

06:23.800 --> 06:28.200
Just because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage between a

06:28.200 --> 06:31.560
man and a woman who form a covenant before God who gave his only begotten son to wash

06:31.560 --> 06:34.120
away the sins of the world when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later

06:34.120 --> 06:35.800
all glory to his name.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.480
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.840
And I'm sure the blue check twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say

06:42.840 --> 06:44.080
anything anymore.

06:44.080 --> 06:49.200
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.240
You know who's really being silenced?

06:52.240 --> 06:54.800
People who are silent.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.040
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.480
That's what being silenced means.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.600
So who's really being silenced?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.720
Not people on podcasts.

07:04.720 --> 07:09.600
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced

07:09.600 --> 07:10.600
they are.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.600
No.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.120
The people who are silenced are people we never hear from.

07:16.120 --> 07:21.960
Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough, they are silenced.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.400
People in prison.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.480
Queer teenagers in conservative towns.

07:25.480 --> 07:29.080
The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.800
Not you, Miss America.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.920
Not you, Mother Superior.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.740
You're not silenced.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.480
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.240
So you defend your right to say it.

07:41.240 --> 07:47.200
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the n-word?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.440
Why do you want to say the n-word?

07:49.440 --> 07:56.920
So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?

07:56.920 --> 07:57.920
Goddammit, Jackson.

07:57.920 --> 08:05.600
Um, that sounds a little bit like being silenced.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.600
She's stonewalling me.

08:06.600 --> 08:12.360
All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain

08:12.360 --> 08:18.720
that there's certain words they just can't say because of the color of their skin.

08:18.720 --> 08:24.240
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.240
Would he?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.160
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.080
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the gospel?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
That's not the topic.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.640
I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

08:38.640 --> 08:42.080
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.440
You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the pride parade, doing all this

08:47.520 --> 08:52.960
sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,

08:53.520 --> 08:58.960
I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,

08:58.960 --> 09:00.160
and I feel for them.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.040
I really do.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.640
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.

09:06.640 --> 09:11.600
You know, what Jew people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate,

09:11.600 --> 09:15.920
but all you're really doing is calling into question the worthiness of other people's lives.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.680
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.560
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

09:22.560 --> 09:28.400
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that they know.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.880
But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.520
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just

09:35.520 --> 09:40.320
bow down to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.

09:40.320 --> 09:45.920
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed

09:45.920 --> 09:49.840
that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore,

09:49.840 --> 09:55.280
that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats

09:55.280 --> 10:00.240
imposing their queer ideology, which says that if your child comes home from school

10:00.240 --> 10:03.280
and announces she's a different gender this week,

10:03.280 --> 10:06.960
then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife,

10:07.520 --> 10:10.720
slicing up tiny little children's bodies.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.640
That's where this is headed.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.280
The Shrine of Moloch.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.720
Oh my God, no one is slicing up children's bodies.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.040
What are you talking about, you absolute lunatic?

10:21.040 --> 10:25.920
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure,

10:26.560 --> 10:33.600
I feel I should let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.640
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

10:37.280 --> 10:38.320
Or should I say...

10:39.440 --> 10:40.080
Justin.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.120
Oh come on, really?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.800
All right, now we're doing this.

10:46.800 --> 11:01.840
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.520
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

11:05.600 --> 11:09.360
No, it's a throw forward to the 20-I-don't-give-a-fucks.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.200
Well, don't mind if I do.

11:14.880 --> 11:18.000
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.400
Good Virginia tobacco.

11:20.400 --> 11:20.960
Jackie?

11:20.960 --> 11:23.920
The Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sale or use of cigarettes,

11:23.920 --> 11:27.360
vaporizers, or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.520
Some restrictions apply, results may vary.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.720
Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.

11:32.720 --> 11:37.520
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today,

11:37.520 --> 11:42.480
and I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

11:42.480 --> 11:47.680
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.360
Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,

11:51.360 --> 11:55.920
then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.600
Excuse me?

11:58.480 --> 12:02.560
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.160
I'm a libertarian.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.480
Anything goes, baby USA.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.000
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

12:12.640 --> 12:17.440
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage,

12:17.440 --> 12:18.800
it would be a free-for-all.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.240
And now, here we are.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.400
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.680
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve,

12:27.680 --> 12:33.680
not Adam and Eve and Kai and Jaden and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.240
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism,

12:38.240 --> 12:43.760
and from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.440
And that's the real agenda here.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.240
These people want to lower the age of consent

12:48.240 --> 12:51.920
and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,

12:52.560 --> 12:56.560
and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.800
Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it,

12:58.800 --> 13:01.840
why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses

13:01.840 --> 13:04.240
back to the nunnery in old Missouri?

13:04.240 --> 13:07.520
Do they not have demons to slay in the back country?

13:07.520 --> 13:12.000
I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
for the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.680
Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.040
We're living in Orwell's nightmare,

13:23.040 --> 13:26.160
but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.040
Amazing.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.800
Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions

13:30.800 --> 13:34.480
can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation.

13:34.480 --> 13:34.960
Wow.

13:34.960 --> 13:35.920
Cheers to us.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.200
Is it great?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.680
You know, I don't think it's that great,

13:39.680 --> 13:42.720
and I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you

13:42.720 --> 13:45.840
sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.000
something you know absolutely nothing about.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.560
Oh, I know more than you might think.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.600
I used to be homosexual.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.320
No, God, no, I'm not doing this today.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.680
I'm sorry, you used to be homosexual?

14:01.680 --> 14:02.880
That's right, Jackie.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.000
Before I was saved.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.640
Here we go.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.240
I used to be a lesbian.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.520
That's who I thought I was.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.760
I lived that lifestyle.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
You used to be a lesbian.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.800
Okay, name five things you love about men.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.680
This should be good.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.440
Gather round, everyone.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.040
Let's all witness the power of Christ.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.040
I'm sure this will be very convincing.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.360
I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.360
He commands me to be holy.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.920
Fear not, you will no longer live in shame,

14:30.640 --> 14:34.000
for your creator will be your husband.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.040
Okay, well, if you want to be the bride of Christ,

14:37.040 --> 14:40.640
then by all means, but you know, keep it in the bedroom.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.040
I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.040
Virginia, I'm confused.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.280
I thought people are just born that way.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.920
Like, Jesus can't change that.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.040
Jackie, the mainstream media establishment

14:53.040 --> 14:56.880
doesn't want you to know that people like me exist

14:56.880 --> 14:59.280
because that goes against their narrative.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.600
But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.160
The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.640
But what if every addict said,

15:10.640 --> 15:12.640
well, I'm just a junkie.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.160
That's who I am.

15:14.160 --> 15:19.600
I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.200
Well, that's a good point.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.040
Uh, no, it isn't.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.360
Gay is just a feeling.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.040
Homosexual lust?

15:27.040 --> 15:28.400
Same-sex temptation?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.600
That's a feeling, not an identity.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.160
Like, maybe you struggle with wrath,

15:34.160 --> 15:37.040
but you don't identify as wrathful.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.200
Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.720
I want to punch you in the face.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.120
And yet, you haven't punched me.

15:43.120 --> 15:48.240
Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.880
When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,

15:52.880 --> 15:55.920
and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.600
My old self has been crucified with Christ.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.720
It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.000
But before I made God Lord of my desires,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I was controlled by sin.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.280
By drugs?

16:09.920 --> 16:10.960
By alcohol?

16:10.960 --> 16:12.560
By homosexuality?

16:12.560 --> 16:15.520
So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.680
Wow, behold the power of Christ.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.360
You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?

16:21.920 --> 16:22.480
Yes, I do.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.400
It's pretty cool.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.920
I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.760
Is this a joke to you?

16:30.560 --> 16:32.240
Do you find this humorous?

16:32.240 --> 16:32.720
Yeah.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.360
I don't.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.320
Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,

16:38.320 --> 16:41.680
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin,

16:41.680 --> 16:44.240
away from God, shut out from grace,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.160
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.960
Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.920
Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?

16:58.560 --> 17:01.840
Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.280
That's right, Jackie.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.720
What were you addicted to?

17:04.720 --> 17:05.520
Miracle Whip?

17:06.320 --> 17:07.200
VeggieTales?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.200
Communion wafers, maybe?

17:09.200 --> 17:12.400
No, I was addicted to alcohol.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.160
To pornography.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.480
To lusting after women.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.960
And to hype.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.000
Hype?

17:20.960 --> 17:24.560
You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?

17:24.560 --> 17:27.760
Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?

17:27.760 --> 17:30.080
Because I am intrigued.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.840
Jackie, I would love to testify.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.800
You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.840
Girl, not this.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.400
When I left home, I was lost.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.840
I was a wretch.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.360
I was on fire.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.640
And I rebuke that fire.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.120
I used foul language.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.960
I went out clubbing.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.320
I cut my hair off.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.280
I gained weight.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.800
I was tempted by same-sex attraction.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.600
And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.440
I was always a little more masculine.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.040
I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
I used to shoot up testosterone.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.720
That's why my voice is a little lower.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.480
Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.560
Honestly, if I didn't know,

18:10.560 --> 18:12.720
I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.200
Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.400
Though if anything, this one's the man.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.320
He's the one injecting testosterone.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.440
God has healed the feminine within me.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.800
All along, God was tugging at my heart.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.120
But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.960
I felt a terrible void inside.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.280
I lived in the flesh.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.840
I lived in sin with another woman,

18:39.840 --> 18:41.760
hoping to satisfy that hunger.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.560
Here we go.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.240
When I gazed upon her beauty,

18:44.240 --> 18:47.040
I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.640
But the light I saw was nothing

18:50.640 --> 18:53.120
but the fire of my own wickedness.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.400
I knew that lifestyle was wrong.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.200
But I couldn't quit until she broke my heart.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.040
And then, I was cast into the outer darkness.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.160
Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.400
It was like a part of me was ripped away

19:13.440 --> 19:16.080
and I was left to face my brokenness alone.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.720
Well, was she a Capricorn?

19:18.720 --> 19:20.400
No, a Sagittarius.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.520
Well, there's your problem.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.080
Next time, maybe try a water sign.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.840
Shh, stop interrupting.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.760
I'm living for the drama.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.280
Jackie, I was alone.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.120
I was suicidal.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.640
I was an addict.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.080
I was lost.

19:34.960 --> 19:39.280
Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.760
And I was surrounded by these women singing.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.720
What can wash away my sin?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.120
What can make me whole again?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

19:52.560 --> 19:55.120
that washes white as snow.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.680
And I felt this tingling all over my body.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.280
And I knew I was hearing the voice of God

20:03.280 --> 20:05.360
for the very first time.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.280
Not just the words of the hymn,

20:07.280 --> 20:11.200
but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.120
Yes, we all like music.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.120
And suddenly, my pain made sense.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.320
I don't have to live this way anymore.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.640
In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.920
I was cleansed.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.600
I was healed.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.640
I was delivered.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.000
I was sanctified.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.040
I was redeemed.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.160
My guilty stains were washed away,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.960
and I exchanged my brokenness and pain

20:34.960 --> 20:36.480
for his loving grace.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.440
Okay, so I'm confused.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.560
Do you eat dick now?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.320
What's your deal?

20:44.320 --> 20:48.080
Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room

20:48.080 --> 20:49.440
with a repentant heart

20:49.440 --> 20:52.080
and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.080
When I found Jesus,

20:54.080 --> 20:57.200
I found someone who truly loves me.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.960
And through obedience to him,

20:59.600 --> 21:03.200
my identity is no longer in my attractions,

21:03.200 --> 21:04.080
but in Christ.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.480
You know what I think, Virginia?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.960
I think that you are immoderate in love

21:08.960 --> 21:11.040
and immoderate with substances.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.520
And so you need an imaginary father figure

21:13.520 --> 21:14.720
to make all the rules

21:14.720 --> 21:17.120
because you can't control yourself.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.920
But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else

21:19.920 --> 21:23.120
should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.320
Mental infancy?

21:25.200 --> 21:28.720
Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.160
I know, Justin, the chains of sin.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.920
I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh,

21:35.920 --> 21:39.040
the itch, the ache, the shame.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.320
I lived in mud.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.840
I lived in filth.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.800
I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,

21:44.800 --> 21:47.200
the great whirlwind that whips sinners

21:47.200 --> 21:49.920
round an endless wheel of pain.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.960
But my shame was hammered to the cross

21:52.960 --> 21:55.120
for those who belong to Christ

21:55.120 --> 21:58.400
have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

22:00.160 --> 22:03.280
Virginia, who are you trying to impress

22:03.280 --> 22:07.600
with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?

22:07.600 --> 22:11.200
Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?

22:11.200 --> 22:11.700
God?

22:12.480 --> 22:14.080
I really don't think he cares, Gorge.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.440
Celibacy is not a good deed.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.000
To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say

22:20.000 --> 22:22.480
that you're gay and you hate yourself.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.160
I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.120
Is it hate to worship the glory of God

22:29.120 --> 22:30.400
over the glory of self?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.280
Where's my nail?

22:31.280 --> 22:34.160
Is it hate to be anchored to the savior's will

22:34.160 --> 22:35.840
that leads me from temptation?

22:35.840 --> 22:36.400
Damn it.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.280
To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity

22:39.280 --> 22:40.320
of who God made me?

22:40.320 --> 22:41.360
I don't have my goddamn nail.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.320
Is it hate to heal the brokenness

22:44.320 --> 22:46.560
and be made whole through radical obedience

22:46.560 --> 22:47.760
to the Holy Spirit?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.520
Have you been made whole, Virginia?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.480
Because to me, it sounds like you amputate

22:52.480 --> 22:56.080
half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame.

22:56.080 --> 22:59.920
Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.440
Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.400
She's hilarious.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.200
She's a wit.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.080
We are all half angel and half beast.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.160
The flesh must die so the spirit may live.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.720
The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.240
Have you really wandered so far astray?

23:18.240 --> 23:22.320
Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom

23:22.320 --> 23:25.600
that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.760
No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.680
What I think is that you have a vulgar,

23:31.680 --> 23:34.880
cracker barrel understanding of human sexuality

23:34.880 --> 23:38.000
and you're on a save the children type moral crusade

23:38.000 --> 23:40.880
because you lack the adult capacity

23:40.880 --> 23:43.200
to face the demons in your own head.

23:43.200 --> 23:47.280
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.600
Well, what even is that, Virginia?

23:50.160 --> 23:51.840
I want specifics.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.520
What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do

23:55.520 --> 23:58.720
if Jesus stops holding your hand for 10 minutes?

23:58.720 --> 24:02.080
What, you think you're gonna rail a line of hype

24:02.080 --> 24:03.120
off a stripper's tits?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.560
Excuse me?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.520
Answer this.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.120
What do you think erotic love is a desire for?

24:09.120 --> 24:10.480
Wait, I know this one.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.200
Sex.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.440
No, that's too easy.

24:16.240 --> 24:20.240
Erotic love is not aimless pleasure seeking.

24:20.240 --> 24:25.520
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,

24:26.320 --> 24:30.480
to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.040
to liberate repressed energy,

24:33.040 --> 24:34.320
to feel alive.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.120
Love is not the flesh.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.280
It's not temptation.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.880
It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.200
It's nothing like being an alcoholic.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.880
It's not a craving.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.120
It's a yearning.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.920
The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.040
But you people don't understand that

24:57.040 --> 25:00.400
because you are vulgarians.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.000
You have no sense of humanity

25:02.560 --> 25:04.480
and you have no sense of the erotic.

25:04.480 --> 25:09.120
Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal Marxist bullcrap.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.880
Jackie, your brain is so small.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.800
It's just so tiny.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.320
Look at me.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.720
You're a dum-dum, okay?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.440
And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

25:21.440 --> 25:27.120
As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.640
Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time

25:30.720 --> 25:34.880
because you're so stupid and I can't stand it anymore.

25:34.880 --> 25:35.520
So shut up.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.640
I'm giving you the plague, liberal.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.440
Okay, well, I hope it kills me because I'm done.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.160
See, I'll never get sick because every day

25:46.160 --> 25:49.120
I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.760
Doctors don't want you to know about it.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.520
I could not possibly be more done.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.320
You may be done, but I'm not.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.000
Well, you people never are, are you?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.360
You want to talk about yearning?

25:59.920 --> 26:01.360
I mean, I get it.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.960
I used to live in shame.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.560
I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.080
Yes, we've all noticed.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.240
Let me tell you, it is not freedom.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.680
It is bondage.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.960
You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.280
The flesh possesses you.

26:17.280 --> 26:21.840
Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.080
For the wages of sin is death,

26:24.080 --> 26:28.400
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.440
You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?

26:31.440 --> 26:35.760
Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.680
Only he can fill the void.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.120
I know.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.360
I used to be like you, Justin.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.400
I was lost.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.600
I was blind.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.920
I was confused in my identity.

26:45.920 --> 26:50.400
I used to reject the gospel until my sin took everything from me

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
and I needed a savior.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.600
And then I called out to God for salvation

26:55.680 --> 26:58.320
and he came to me as a loving father.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.040
It's not too late for you, Justin.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.360
You are so loved.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.040
God loves you.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.160
But this?

27:07.120 --> 27:09.200
This is not God's intent for you.

27:09.200 --> 27:13.200
It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.680
The height of cosmological narcissism.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.080
I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?

27:18.640 --> 27:21.120
Have we run out of fedoras in America?

27:21.120 --> 27:23.360
I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.160
I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.040
God is love.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.560
Is he the only love worth having?

27:30.560 --> 27:34.160
What you call love, the sin I used to live in,

27:34.160 --> 27:36.480
the world, the flesh, and the devil,

27:36.480 --> 27:39.040
that only ever brought me pain.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.360
Yes, because heartbreak is painful.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.120
Love is painful.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.280
The poets are unanimous.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.000
Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
Eros, giver of pain.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.920
What's Sappho?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.680
A pagan pornographer.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.400
The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.

27:56.400 --> 28:00.400
Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,

28:00.400 --> 28:03.680
then goddammit, I don't know who can.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.360
Well, God for one.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.560
God has a sexual plan for all of us.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.280
That's odd.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.640
God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.080
Men's and women's bodies fit together

28:16.080 --> 28:18.000
for the purpose of creating children.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.240
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?

28:20.800 --> 28:24.560
Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by,

28:24.560 --> 28:25.760
even in this economy.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.480
You have a guy?

28:27.360 --> 28:28.640
A semen guy?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.080
That's just most guys.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.360
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,

28:33.360 --> 28:36.480
but since I'm among heathens, clearly,

28:37.120 --> 28:39.840
I will do my best to argue not from faith,

28:40.400 --> 28:41.760
but from reason.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.880
I love reason.

28:42.880 --> 28:43.440
Do you?

28:43.440 --> 28:45.120
Tell me this, Justin.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.720
Which is better?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.240
A love that is eternal?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.520
Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?

28:52.400 --> 28:54.080
I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,

28:54.080 --> 28:55.280
that must have been really hard.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.800
Just answer the question.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.240
Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.120
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.120
Isn't a love that is eternal

29:03.680 --> 29:05.920
superior to a love that is fleeting?

29:07.200 --> 29:09.520
Yes, Socrates, it is certain.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.800
And don't you yearn?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.960
Not just for a love in the moment,

29:12.960 --> 29:16.000
but for a love that lasts eternity?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.880
Yes, Socrates, that is evident.

29:18.880 --> 29:24.640
And isn't eternal love what we call God?

29:25.920 --> 29:28.800
Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.280
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.080
So you have no argument.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.200
Do I really need an argument?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.840
This is just a semantic trick.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.000
You're saying that God is eternal love,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.400
and then magically that must exist

29:44.400 --> 29:47.200
because you defined it that way?

29:47.200 --> 29:50.800
So you don't have an argument?

29:51.840 --> 29:52.480
I'm sorry.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.040
Interesting.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560
I didn't prepare to have a debate

29:54.560 --> 29:57.520
about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo

29:57.520 --> 29:59.360
cosplaying as a trad wife.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.440
I'm supposed to take this seriously?

30:01.440 --> 30:01.940
Why?

30:02.560 --> 30:03.360
Why am I even here?

30:03.360 --> 30:04.000
What am I doing?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.360
Why am I talking to these people?

30:05.360 --> 30:10.160
I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.800
I don't think God leads people to podcasts.

30:12.800 --> 30:16.160
Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

30:16.160 --> 30:19.360
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.080
There's a hunger in your soul.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.040
No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.720
Do you not feel the thirst in your body

30:29.360 --> 30:31.040
like a parched land?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.600
Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.360
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.280
If I may quote Psalm 63.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.000
Please don't.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.840
You, God, are my God.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
Earnestly, I seek you.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.240
I thirst for you.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.560
My whole being longs for you

30:46.560 --> 30:49.920
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.600
Because your love is better than life,

30:54.240 --> 30:56.240
my lips will glorify you.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.680
I will praise you as long as I live.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.520
And in your name, I will raise up my hands.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.560
I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.560
With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.040
Virginia, go to therapy.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.920
Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.680
You're the one who needs to go to therapy.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.800
Now you go to therapy.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.640
I'll pray for you.

31:24.640 --> 31:25.920
I'll pray for you.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.680
I will pray straight to Satan.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.440
Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little Looney Tunes?

31:32.320 --> 31:34.080
You have your Jesus bullshit.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.120
You have your gender nonsense.

31:37.120 --> 31:41.360
And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.960
The free market, right.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.240
We all have our little delusions.

31:46.240 --> 31:49.200
The important thing is that we cling to them

31:49.200 --> 31:53.680
and we never let go no matter how much evidence gets in the way.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.840
Because that's what makes us free.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.920
And freedom is what makes America great.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.560
Other countries, they don't have choices.

32:03.200 --> 32:08.160
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.320
So can we do drugs?

32:10.320 --> 32:12.240
No, that's illegal.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.680
I thought you said we could choose.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.640
Yes, but we have to make the right choices.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.200
And what if we want to make the wrong choices?

32:19.200 --> 32:22.400
Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.

32:22.400 --> 32:27.440
You will be locked in a tiny cage that is literally the opposite of freedom.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
Well, we have to be tough on crime.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.840
It's the only way to keep this country free.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.240
We have to build more prisons.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.920
Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.600
Well, Father decides.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.120
Father always decides.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.280
And do you always do what Father says?

32:44.080 --> 32:46.240
Of course, we always do what Father says.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.080
Why?

32:48.080 --> 32:50.000
Because Father says so.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.640
Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.160
Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.200
Yes, you do.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.200
You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.

33:01.200 --> 33:01.760
No, I'm not.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.720
I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.480
My heart was also broken by a woman.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.400
I thought she was a cat girl.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.640
She turned out to be a fuckboy.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.840
You are a straight man.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.000
I mean, at this point, I wish.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.440
But no, definitely a gay woman.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.640
We're all stuck with it.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.920
Hold on.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.640
So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.520
Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?

33:29.520 --> 33:30.080
No.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.520
In the mirror?

33:31.520 --> 33:35.200
No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference

33:35.200 --> 33:37.680
between my own reflection and a different person.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.120
Desire is always for something that you lack.

33:41.760 --> 33:46.000
You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.280
Desire feeds on absence.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.600
It reaches out across a void.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.560
I don't know.

33:52.560 --> 33:56.000
I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.560
Okay, well, thank you for sharing.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.040
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?

34:02.480 --> 34:04.400
Do you have bodies in your basement?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
You better watch out or you're gonna be next.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.280
Are those clothes even yours?

34:09.920 --> 34:12.640
Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?

34:12.640 --> 34:17.440
Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,

34:17.440 --> 34:18.720
and I will feast upon it.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.920
Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.880
It's not enough for you to possess a woman.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.320
You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.

34:30.320 --> 34:33.120
Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?

34:33.120 --> 34:35.520
You're the one who keeps bringing that up.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.320
Nice.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.040
Got her!

34:37.040 --> 34:38.320
Shut up, dum-dum.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.880
I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.840
You stay out of this.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.440
Look, so you're a straight man.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.680
You could have had a wife.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.840
You could have raised a family.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.080
Your life could have meant something.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.920
But you threw it all away?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.880
You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.720
Do you have babies?

34:57.280 --> 34:59.440
Well, priests don't have babies.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.280
Maybe think of queer people as priests.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.440
Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.800
Whoa, okay.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.240
That's Catholics.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.120
That's not Christians.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.120
Just kind of crossing a line, don't you think?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.040
Oh, has free speech gone too far?

35:13.840 --> 35:15.360
Now it's gone too far.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.520
Can we have a civil conversation, please?

35:18.080 --> 35:22.080
Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?

35:22.080 --> 35:24.400
Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.080
Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility

35:28.080 --> 35:33.120
by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.

35:34.080 --> 35:38.240
I walk with the spirit until the day I go to glory.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.680
That's my meaning.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.280
Your meaning is what?

35:41.840 --> 35:46.560
To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty

35:46.560 --> 35:49.760
until you rot away unresurrected in the earth?

35:49.760 --> 35:50.560
And for what?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.160
To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

35:54.800 --> 35:57.040
Anything else would be a lie.

35:57.040 --> 36:01.280
If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.640
And with or without your approval and understanding,

36:04.640 --> 36:07.520
I will always be the way I am.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.760
Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?

36:12.640 --> 36:17.680
I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.920
Just leave children out of it.

36:22.640 --> 36:26.800
Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.

36:27.360 --> 36:32.960
And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.

36:41.760 --> 36:47.920
Listen, Justin, I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.480
I know my place in this world.

36:50.480 --> 36:56.240
I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.

36:56.960 --> 37:02.720
Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A$ community?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.640
Well, obviously not.

37:04.640 --> 37:09.360
Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.720
Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.

37:12.720 --> 37:19.840
So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl gf.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.200
Can you honestly say that you're happy?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.760
That you're fulfilled?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.320
That you have purpose?

37:29.680 --> 37:32.320
That you have hope?

37:50.720 --> 37:53.520
Justin.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.160
Justin.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.760
Justin.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.120
Justin.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.520
Justin.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.160
Hello?

38:22.160 --> 38:23.200
Justin.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.240
Hello?

38:29.600 --> 38:30.480
Jesus!

38:30.480 --> 38:31.840
Ha!

38:31.840 --> 38:33.680
Don't say that name in front of me.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.680
How did you get in my house?

38:35.680 --> 38:39.120
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.640
Who are you?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.600
What are you?

38:41.600 --> 38:45.680
Well, I used to be an angel.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.600
And now?

38:47.600 --> 38:52.320
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

38:52.320 --> 38:57.760
A satanic visitation at this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the

38:57.760 --> 39:01.440
country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.720
Yes.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.360
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.880
Do you want it to be?

39:06.880 --> 39:07.760
No.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.280
Look, I've had a terrible day.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.600
I'm really not in the mood for this.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.920
Well, I can help you with that.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.200
Can you?

39:15.200 --> 39:16.080
Sure.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.600
I can help with anything.

39:17.600 --> 39:28.400
Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.320
Shame?

39:30.320 --> 39:31.920
Is it the shame?

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
Well, yeah, there's the shame.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.080
There's always going to be the shame.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.520
But it's a complex cocktail.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.880
There's the heartbreak, there's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.880
I'm a parched landloose.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.320
I've got the hunger.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.680
The emptiness inside.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.880
Oh, emptiness inside.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.320
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.560
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.200
It's not a weird sex thing.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.280
Potions, Justine.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.480
Potions.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.480
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.920
Potions?

40:05.920 --> 40:11.200
Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.760
Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.000
A dealer.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.320
Are you trying to get demonetized?

40:20.320 --> 40:21.440
Sorry.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.520
What potions do you have?

40:23.520 --> 40:27.520
Well, this is one of my favorites.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.160
It's called hype.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.240
This will make you come alive.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.560
You'll jump right out of your shell.

40:34.560 --> 40:39.360
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

40:39.360 --> 40:43.520
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.520
You'll finally get things done.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.920
You'll connect with people.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.680
You'll always know just what to say.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.720
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

40:54.720 --> 40:59.200
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.800
Pain?

41:00.800 --> 41:04.640
Well, I surely have something for that.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.600
It's called void.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.400
One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.

41:12.400 --> 41:16.480
The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,

41:16.480 --> 41:22.480
the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.

41:22.480 --> 41:26.800
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket

41:26.800 --> 41:31.360
of serenity and love.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.680
Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.

41:35.680 --> 41:38.720
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.480
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.840
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness

41:45.840 --> 41:49.840
all alone?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.840
What, do you need a clear mind to process

41:51.840 --> 41:54.080
how bad you were on that podcast?

41:54.080 --> 41:56.240
Because it was embarrassing, humiliating.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.560
Honestly, it was difficult to watch.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.360
Shut up.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.520
Is it some kind of masochism?

42:01.520 --> 42:04.320
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.160
Because you're not impressing anyone.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.160
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

42:08.160 --> 42:10.000
You're going to sit around stalking your ex

42:10.000 --> 42:11.840
on social media all night?

42:11.840 --> 42:13.840
Because that is pathetic.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.720
And it's so unnecessary, because you're

42:16.720 --> 42:21.280
choosing to feel bad, when with one drop of void,

42:21.280 --> 42:25.280
you can be in bliss.

42:25.280 --> 42:28.000
Pass.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.440
The cool kids are doing it.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.360
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it,

42:31.360 --> 42:33.120
because it's not the 90s.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.760
Kids today are vaping Benadryl.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.200
Don't you keep up with this?

42:37.200 --> 42:40.240
OK, I mean, I respect your choice,

42:40.240 --> 42:43.440
but I'm not going anywhere.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.920
I will stay right here.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.960
And I will remind you every minute,

42:48.960 --> 42:51.520
for hundreds of consecutive minutes,

42:51.520 --> 42:55.360
that your pain is optional.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.880
And I have the antidote right here.

42:58.960 --> 43:04.240
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain, and shame,

43:04.240 --> 43:12.880
and humiliation, and heartbreak, and boredom, loneliness,

43:12.880 --> 43:22.960
despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.760
Look, I'm a smart person, OK?

43:25.760 --> 43:27.280
And I'm not going to let you turn me

43:27.280 --> 43:30.080
into some kind of pathetic junkie.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.760
Pathetic?

43:31.760 --> 43:35.840
Is it pathetic to feel good?

43:35.840 --> 43:40.160
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

43:40.160 --> 43:44.560
And to me, that's pathetic.

43:44.560 --> 43:53.840
Well, the thing about that, it's OK.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.440
Just give me the goddamn void.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.840
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.920
I thought I was going to be here all night.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.920
Well, my will is weak, OK?

44:01.920 --> 44:03.520
Can I have the potion, please?

44:03.520 --> 44:06.000
All right, well, let's be a little patient.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.840
You should really do this the right way, OK?

44:07.840 --> 44:09.520
It's called harm reduction.

44:09.520 --> 44:14.960
What you're going to do is put one drop, and only one drop,

44:14.960 --> 44:18.080
of pure void into water.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.840
This is important.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.480
Do not do too many drops.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.560
What happens if I do too many drops?

44:24.560 --> 44:26.720
Oh, you'll probably die.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.920
I'll die?

44:27.920 --> 44:29.760
I told you it was important.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.920
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.160
Well, it's difficult to say exactly.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.760
It depends on a lot of factors.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.600
Seriously?

44:37.600 --> 44:40.000
But it's your first time, so just do one.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.400
So do I just drink it, or?

44:52.400 --> 44:53.600
Of course you drink it.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.600
It's a purely fictional magical potion,

44:55.600 --> 44:58.560
utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.160
What else would you do with it?

45:00.160 --> 45:00.660
OK.

45:11.120 --> 45:11.680
Good girl.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.160
I don't feel anything.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.760
OK, well, give it a minute.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.920
In about 15 seconds, you are not going

45:17.920 --> 45:19.600
to know the meaning of the word pain.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.480
Are you ready for that?

45:21.440 --> 45:24.960
Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.240
And my goddamn...

45:39.680 --> 45:40.800
There she goes.

45:42.080 --> 45:42.800
Thank god.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.280
Well, don't thank god.

45:47.280 --> 45:47.840
Thank me.

45:47.840 --> 45:51.600
I will not have father taking credit for my work.

46:17.840 --> 46:34.240
Lucy?

46:35.760 --> 46:36.260
Lucy?

46:37.760 --> 46:38.800
Luciferia?

46:40.720 --> 46:41.220
Mother?

46:42.400 --> 46:43.040
A doctor?

46:43.920 --> 46:45.200
Mother doctor?

46:45.200 --> 46:46.000
Doctor mother?

46:47.120 --> 46:47.600
Mom?

46:48.320 --> 46:49.440
Mother void?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.240
Mother void?

46:52.160 --> 46:52.660
Yes?

46:54.960 --> 46:55.840
Help me, doctor.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.160
I'm being cancelled.

46:58.880 --> 47:02.160
Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online.

47:02.160 --> 47:02.960
So what?

47:04.000 --> 47:05.360
You don't understand, doctor.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.680
I'm in love with this furry.

47:08.640 --> 47:10.560
You really are far from god.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.640
You're further from god than I am.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.440
Lucy, can I get a drop?

47:16.240 --> 47:17.040
A drop.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.560
I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.760
Doctor, my pain is at a 10.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.840
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.760
I'm a little disappointed, honestly.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.400
I enjoy the thrill of the chase.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.160
But there's no chase with you.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.600
No chase at all.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.200
You're easy.

47:37.200 --> 47:40.160
An easy little void slut.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.760
A slut for the void.

47:42.960 --> 47:46.160
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.440
Please, just give me the void so I can fill the emptiness.

47:50.640 --> 47:54.800
If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.520
But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?

47:58.080 --> 47:59.440
You call me mommy now.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.720
Because I own you.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.520
Yes, mommy dearest.

49:16.640 --> 49:20.320
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.160
Five drops already.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.400
Escalating, aren't we?

49:34.400 --> 49:37.120
Well yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.080
So you're going to do five drops?

49:40.080 --> 49:41.360
Just to take the edge off.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.520
I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.

49:46.320 --> 49:51.520
Oh wow, if it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.600
By all means, continue.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.200
Well, thank you for being supportive.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.000
Cheers.

50:46.160 --> 51:05.600
That was, that was dumb.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.720
That was so dumb.

51:08.720 --> 51:21.760
I need to quit.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.520
I've got to quit.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.320
I'm going to quit.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.240
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

51:30.240 --> 51:30.960
Yes, Mother.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.120
I'm going to quit.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.440
Good luck.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.720
Good luck.

51:36.720 --> 51:42.160
I'll quit after one more drop.

51:42.160 --> 51:42.880
Of course.

51:49.600 --> 51:50.640
All right, that's it.

51:51.280 --> 51:51.920
Never again.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.480
I'm quitting.

51:57.840 --> 51:58.320
I quit.

51:58.320 --> 52:02.320
I quit.

52:02.320 --> 52:07.680
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

52:10.880 --> 52:23.840
How hard could that be?

52:28.880 --> 52:36.800
No, I can't do this.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.320
I can't do this.

52:38.320 --> 52:49.840
Shit, shit.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.240
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.680
Lucy, Lucy.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.600
Lucy, I want to sleep.

52:59.600 --> 53:00.800
Wake up, Lucy.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.160
Lucy, wake up.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.840
Wake up!

53:59.120 --> 54:11.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

54:11.840 --> 54:23.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

54:23.840 --> 54:43.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

54:43.840 --> 55:03.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

55:03.840 --> 55:23.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

55:23.840 --> 55:43.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

55:43.840 --> 56:03.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

56:03.840 --> 56:23.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

56:23.840 --> 56:43.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

56:43.840 --> 57:03.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

57:03.840 --> 57:23.840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
