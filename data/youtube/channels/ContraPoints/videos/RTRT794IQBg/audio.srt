00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
The following program is a work of fiction, created for educational, artistic, and harm

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,720
reduction purposes, in compliance with the Videocorp Terms of Service.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,280
I love Videocorp.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,800
I love the rules.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Any resemblance to actual persons is a super crazy coincidence.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,880
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,120
T.S. Natalie Wynn.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
War?

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:44,120
What is it good for?

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,240
Absolutely gwad-sam-everything, according to the National Institute for Strategic American

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
Liberty Heritage Enterprise Prosperity Commerce Policy Research.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,680
You're listening to the Freedom Pod, where it doesn't matter what you say, it only matters

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
that you say.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,480
We don't discriminate here between what is true or false, or even downright dangerous.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,720
That's none of my business.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,600
It's none of America's business.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,440
The important thing is that you never stop talking.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,000
Because that's what freedom is all about.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,080
Tonight, the war on drugs.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,320
How do we get these god damn junkies off the streets?

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Jackie.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,920
My first guest is Justine Tablo, leftist influencer and author of such books as Revolutionize

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,240
Your Brand, How to Capitalize on Communism.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,280
The editor chooses the title, I didn't choose the title.

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,680
And my second guest is Virginia Lam, senior pastor at Hope Truth Ministries.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Virginia, let's begin with you.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,100
Every day in Biden's America, Muslim cartels are driving Mexican dump trucks full of Chinese

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,600
Fentavoid across the Rio Grande, and they're getting our children amped out of their little

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
minds on hype.

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,680
The world is laughing at us, even the Canadians, with their pronouns and their genders.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,520
How have we reached this point?

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,720
Two words, Jackie.

34
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,960
Sexual anarchy.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Let that sink in.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Let what sink in?

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
Sexual anarchy?

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
What does that even mean?

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,760
Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,840
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
aimless fornication.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,400
They're tearing apart the social fabric, and normal Americans are being silenced.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,640
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel-culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,480
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,040
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
America, the Christian majority.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little more specific?

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,240
Of course, Jackie.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Religious liberties are under attack.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,200
We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children, who are growing up in

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
public schools run by social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender-neutral

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,000
bathrooms and drag queen story hours than teach young people about the wonder-working

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,080
power of the precious blood of the Lamb.

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country, I'm sorry that you feel offended

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
by it.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,800
And believe it or not, the Founding Fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,720
twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity.

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,000
Jackie, these communists are polluting the innocence of children, and if you speak out

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,400
against the grooming, they call you a bigot.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Parents get no say anymore, they're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,880
about the deviant lifestyles promoted in schools.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,080
You know, one day your kids will come home, and you won't even recognize them anymore.

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
That's the real agenda here.

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Sexual indoctrination.

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,360
This generation that's coming up, 20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,360
remaining 70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists,

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
or worse, Episcopalians.

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
No.

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,360
No, I won't stand for that.

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,080
I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, everything.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,320
Addiction and sexual brokenness?

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,400
These are two heads of the same serpent, symptoms of the same cultural leprosy.

74
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,320
Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers, childhood sexual abuse.

75
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Is anyone going to ask me what I think?

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen to the ramblings of a bigoted

77
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
hate preacher?

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,960
Well, God has nothing to do with hate.

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
Christ is the definition of love.

80
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,240
Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia, I'm talking about you.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,600
Justine, if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot?

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,880
You liberals call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot.

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Exactly.

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,560
Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once, and have a calm, rational

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,280
conversation with people who have different opinions?

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,440
Okay, well, let's see how that goes.

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,400
Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to set people free from sexual brokenness

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,200
and protect the rights of children.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Kids who are struggling with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative

90
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,280
therapy that will make them whole again.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,720
Reparative therapy?

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,360
You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

93
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,880
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,200
and polluted and they need God to make them whole.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,960
You people are selling the cure to a sickness you created.

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,720
Are you cancel-culturing me right now?

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,760
Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing you right now.

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,240
Are you thought-policing me?

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,960
No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing everyone else.

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,800
You're saying it should be a thought crime?

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
You're saying that I'm a thought criminal?

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,200
Just because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage between a

103
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,560
man and a woman who form a covenant before God who gave his only begotten son to wash

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,120
away the sins of the world when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,800
all glory to his name.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,840
And I'm sure the blue check twitter mob is already coming for me because you can't say

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
anything anymore.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,200
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

110
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,240
You know who's really being silenced?

111
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
People who are silent.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

113
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
That's what being silenced means.

114
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,600
So who's really being silenced?

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,720
Not people on podcasts.

116
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,600
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history about how silenced

117
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
they are.

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
No.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,120
The people who are silenced are people we never hear from.

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough, they are silenced.

121
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
People in prison.

122
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,480
Queer teenagers in conservative towns.

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,080
The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.

124
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,800
Not you, Miss America.

125
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,920
Not you, Mother Superior.

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,740
You're not silenced.

127
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,480
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

128
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,240
So you defend your right to say it.

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,200
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced, then why can't I say the n-word?

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,440
Why do you want to say the n-word?

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,920
So I only have freedom of speech when it conforms to your liberal ideology?

132
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Goddammit, Jackson.

133
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,600
Um, that sounds a little bit like being silenced.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
She's stonewalling me.

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,360
All over America today, white parents are having to sit their children down and explain

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,720
that there's certain words they just can't say because of the color of their skin.

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would be turning in his grave.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Would he?

139
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,160
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave, but not for the reasons you think.

140
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,080
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic and share the good news of the gospel?

141
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
That's not the topic.

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,640
I have prayed on this, and honestly, the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

143
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

144
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,440
You know, when I look out at all these angry people at the pride parade, doing all this

145
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,960
sexual acting out and wearing provocative clothing in a desperate bid for attention,

146
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,960
I see the broken childhoods, and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,

147
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,160
and I feel for them.

148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,040
I really do.

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,640
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity on the poor sad homos.

150
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,600
You know, what Jew people really love is the aesthetic of being compassionate,

151
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920
but all you're really doing is calling into question the worthiness of other people's lives.

152
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live, you know?

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

154
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,400
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm the most compassionate person that they know.

155
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,880
But love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

156
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,520
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just

157
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,320
bow down to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.

158
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions about this narrative we're all being force-fed

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,840
that God and scripture have no place in American life anymore,

160
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,280
that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats

161
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,240
imposing their queer ideology, which says that if your child comes home from school

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,280
and announces she's a different gender this week,

163
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,960
then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's knife,

164
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,720
slicing up tiny little children's bodies.

165
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
That's where this is headed.

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,280
The Shrine of Moloch.

167
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,720
Oh my God, no one is slicing up children's bodies.

168
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
What are you talking about, you absolute lunatic?

169
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure,

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,600
I feel I should let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

171
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

172
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
Or should I say...

173
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,080
Justin.

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
Oh come on, really?

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
All right, now we're doing this.

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

177
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,520
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
No, it's a throw forward to the 20-I-don't-give-a-fucks.

179
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, don't mind if I do.

180
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

181
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,400
Good Virginia tobacco.

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,960
Jackie?

183
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,920
The Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sale or use of cigarettes,

184
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,360
vaporizers, or other nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,520
Some restrictions apply, results may vary.

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,720
Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,520
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today,

188
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,480
and I really have nothing to say to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we are.

190
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,360
Virginia, if you're not prepared to get splashed,

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,920
then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Excuse me?

193
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,560
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

194
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm a libertarian.

195
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
Anything goes, baby USA.

196
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,440
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage,

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,800
it would be a free-for-all.

199
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,240
And now, here we are.

200
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,400
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

201
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,680
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve,

202
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,680
not Adam and Eve and Kai and Jaden and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Skylar and Rainbow.

203
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism,

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,760
and from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

205
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
And that's the real agenda here.

206
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
These people want to lower the age of consent

207
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,920
and legalize sodomy with all the beasts that walk the earth,

208
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,560
and the birds of the sea, and all the fishes of the sky.

209
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
Well, Virginia, if you're so worried about it,

210
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,840
why don't you take your Mickey Mouse sexual neuroses

211
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
back to the nunnery in old Missouri?

212
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Do they not have demons to slay in the back country?

213
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,000
I rejoice in persecution and revilement for the sake of righteousness,

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
for the Lord commands me not to hate my brother, Justin.

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,680
Wow, super controversial, super provocative, super brave and super bold.

216
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
We're living in Orwell's nightmare,

217
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,160
but you're a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced.

218
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,040
Amazing.

219
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,800
Look, I just think it's great that three people with differing opinions

220
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation.

221
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,960
Wow.

222
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,920
Cheers to us.

223
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,200
Is it great?

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
You know, I don't think it's that great,

225
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
and I don't think there's anything respectful about the two of you

226
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,840
sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people,

227
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,000
something you know absolutely nothing about.

228
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Oh, I know more than you might think.

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
I used to be homosexual.

230
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,320
No, God, no, I'm not doing this today.

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm sorry, you used to be homosexual?

232
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
That's right, Jackie.

233
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
Before I was saved.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,640
Here we go.

235
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,240
I used to be a lesbian.

236
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,520
That's who I thought I was.

237
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,760
I lived that lifestyle.

238
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
You used to be a lesbian.

239
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
Okay, name five things you love about men.

240
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,680
This should be good.

241
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
Gather round, everyone.

242
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Let's all witness the power of Christ.

243
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm sure this will be very convincing.

244
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,360
I love the Lord, who does not command me to be straight.

245
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
He commands me to be holy.

246
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
Fear not, you will no longer live in shame,

247
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,000
for your creator will be your husband.

248
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
Okay, well, if you want to be the bride of Christ,

249
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,640
then by all means, but you know, keep it in the bedroom.

250
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,040
I'm tired of you people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face.

251
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Virginia, I'm confused.

252
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,280
I thought people are just born that way.

253
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,920
Like, Jesus can't change that.

254
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,040
Jackie, the mainstream media establishment

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
doesn't want you to know that people like me exist

256
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
because that goes against their narrative.

257
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,600
But recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories.

258
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,160
The ploy of the enemy is to make us feel that we cannot change.

259
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,640
But what if every addict said,

260
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
well, I'm just a junkie.

261
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,160
That's who I am.

262
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,600
I sexually identify as an alcoholic, so Jesus can't change me.

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Well, that's a good point.

264
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,040
Uh, no, it isn't.

265
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
Gay is just a feeling.

266
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
Homosexual lust?

267
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,400
Same-sex temptation?

268
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,600
That's a feeling, not an identity.

269
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Like, maybe you struggle with wrath,

270
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,040
but you don't identify as wrathful.

271
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,200
Maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the face.

272
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720
I want to punch you in the face.

273
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
And yet, you haven't punched me.

274
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,240
Lo and behold, you have a desire without acting on the desire.

275
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
When I was saved, I left behind the false identity I used to walk in,

276
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,920
and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love.

277
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,600
My old self has been crucified with Christ.

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
It is no longer I who lives, but Christ lives in me.

279
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
But before I made God Lord of my desires,

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was controlled by sin.

281
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,280
By drugs?

282
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,960
By alcohol?

283
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,560
By homosexuality?

284
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,520
So you used to be cool, and now you're boring.

285
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,680
Wow, behold the power of Christ.

286
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,360
You think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication?

287
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,480
Yes, I do.

288
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
It's pretty cool.

289
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication.

290
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,760
Is this a joke to you?

291
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
Do you find this humorous?

292
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah.

293
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
I don't.

294
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,320
Because I have glimpsed the gates of hell,

295
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin,

296
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
away from God, shut out from grace,

297
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,160
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame.

298
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,960
Yes, we've all been to Cincinnati.

299
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,920
Can we wrap this back around to the drug topic?

300
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,840
Virginia, you're saying you used to be an addict?

301
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,280
That's right, Jackie.

302
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,720
What were you addicted to?

303
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,520
Miracle Whip?

304
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,200
VeggieTales?

305
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,200
Communion wafers, maybe?

306
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
No, I was addicted to alcohol.

307
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,160
To pornography.

308
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
To lusting after women.

309
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,960
And to hype.

310
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,000
Hype?

311
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,560
You, Virginia Lamb, were a hype addict?

312
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,760
Look, Virginia, can you drop a quick story time on this?

313
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
Because I am intrigued.

314
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,840
Jackie, I would love to testify.

315
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,800
You know, growing up, I never really felt connected to my mother.

316
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
Girl, not this.

317
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
When I left home, I was lost.

318
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
I was a wretch.

319
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
I was on fire.

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,640
And I rebuke that fire.

321
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
I used foul language.

322
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
I went out clubbing.

323
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,320
I cut my hair off.

324
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
I gained weight.

325
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,800
I was tempted by same-sex attraction.

326
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,600
And I struggled with gender confusion, you know?

327
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
I was always a little more masculine.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,040
I'd even started down the path toward transgendered.

329
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
I used to shoot up testosterone.

330
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
That's why my voice is a little lower.

331
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
Yeah, the two of you sound kind of the same.

332
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,560
Honestly, if I didn't know,

333
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man.

334
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Neither of us is the man, Jacqueline.

335
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
Though if anything, this one's the man.

336
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
He's the one injecting testosterone.

337
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
God has healed the feminine within me.

338
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,800
All along, God was tugging at my heart.

339
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
But for me, the road to heaven led through hell.

340
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,960
I felt a terrible void inside.

341
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
I lived in the flesh.

342
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
I lived in sin with another woman,

343
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
hoping to satisfy that hunger.

344
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,560
Here we go.

345
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,240
When I gazed upon her beauty,

346
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,040
I thought sunlight had broken through the clouds.

347
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
But the light I saw was nothing

348
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,120
but the fire of my own wickedness.

349
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,400
I knew that lifestyle was wrong.

350
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,200
But I couldn't quit until she broke my heart.

351
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,040
And then, I was cast into the outer darkness.

352
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,160
Yeah, she probably got tired of your Jesus bullshit.

353
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,400
It was like a part of me was ripped away

354
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
and I was left to face my brokenness alone.

355
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
Well, was she a Capricorn?

356
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
No, a Sagittarius.

357
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
Well, there's your problem.

358
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
Next time, maybe try a water sign.

359
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
Shh, stop interrupting.

360
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm living for the drama.

361
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,280
Jackie, I was alone.

362
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
I was suicidal.

363
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,640
I was an addict.

364
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,080
I was lost.

365
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Until one day, I decided to go to church with my mom.

366
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,760
And I was surrounded by these women singing.

367
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
What can wash away my sin?

368
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,120
What can make me whole again?

369
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

370
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,120
that washes white as snow.

371
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,680
And I felt this tingling all over my body.

372
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,280
And I knew I was hearing the voice of God

373
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
for the very first time.

374
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
Not just the words of the hymn,

375
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
but the voice of the Father speaking directly to me.

376
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
Yes, we all like music.

377
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
And suddenly, my pain made sense.

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
I don't have to live this way anymore.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,640
In that moment, I was transfigured by the Holy Spirit.

380
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
I was cleansed.

381
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,600
I was healed.

382
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,640
I was delivered.

383
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
I was sanctified.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,040
I was redeemed.

385
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,160
My guilty stains were washed away,

386
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,960
and I exchanged my brokenness and pain

387
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
for his loving grace.

388
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,440
Okay, so I'm confused.

389
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,560
Do you eat dick now?

390
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,320
What's your deal?

391
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,080
Jackie, my deal is that I entered the throne room

392
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
with a repentant heart

393
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,080
and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the Father.

394
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
When I found Jesus,

395
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,200
I found someone who truly loves me.

396
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
And through obedience to him,

397
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
my identity is no longer in my attractions,

398
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,080
but in Christ.

399
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
You know what I think, Virginia?

400
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
I think that you are immoderate in love

401
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,040
and immoderate with substances.

402
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,520
And so you need an imaginary father figure

403
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
to make all the rules

404
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,120
because you can't control yourself.

405
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,920
But your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else

406
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,120
should have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy.

407
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
Mental infancy?

408
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
Bondage to the flesh is mental infancy.

409
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,160
I know, Justin, the chains of sin.

410
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,920
I know the murmuring complaints of the flesh,

411
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,040
the itch, the ache, the shame.

412
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,320
I lived in mud.

413
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
I lived in filth.

414
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,800
I know the thorns, the seething cauldron,

415
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,200
the great whirlwind that whips sinners

416
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,920
round an endless wheel of pain.

417
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,960
But my shame was hammered to the cross

418
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
for those who belong to Christ

419
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,400
have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

420
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,280
Virginia, who are you trying to impress

421
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,600
with this ostentatious sexual anorexia?

422
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Who is the beneficiary of your erotic constipation?

423
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,700
God?

424
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
I really don't think he cares, Gorge.

425
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,440
Celibacy is not a good deed.

426
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,480
that you're gay and you hate yourself.

428
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,160
I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

429
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,120
Is it hate to worship the glory of God

430
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
over the glory of self?

431
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,280
Where's my nail?

432
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,160
Is it hate to be anchored to the savior's will

433
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,840
that leads me from temptation?

434
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,400
Damn it.

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,280
To walk with purpose, abiding in the identity

436
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,320
of who God made me?

437
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,360
I don't have my goddamn nail.

438
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
Is it hate to heal the brokenness

439
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,560
and be made whole through radical obedience

440
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,760
to the Holy Spirit?

441
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
Have you been made whole, Virginia?

442
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,480
Because to me, it sounds like you amputate

443
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,080
half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame.

444
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,920
Well, that's my definition of sexual brokenness.

445
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?

446
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,400
She's hilarious.

447
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,200
She's a wit.

448
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
We are all half angel and half beast.

449
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,160
The flesh must die so the spirit may live.

450
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

451
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,240
Have you really wandered so far astray?

452
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,320
Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of Sodom

453
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,600
that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul?

454
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

455
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,680
What I think is that you have a vulgar,

456
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,880
cracker barrel understanding of human sexuality

457
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,000
and you're on a save the children type moral crusade

458
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,880
because you lack the adult capacity

459
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
to face the demons in your own head.

460
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,280
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation.

461
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,600
Well, what even is that, Virginia?

462
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
I want specifics.

463
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,520
What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do

464
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
if Jesus stops holding your hand for 10 minutes?

465
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,080
What, you think you're gonna rail a line of hype

466
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
off a stripper's tits?

467
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,560
Excuse me?

468
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,520
Answer this.

469
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,120
What do you think erotic love is a desire for?

470
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
Wait, I know this one.

471
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,200
Sex.

472
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,440
No, that's too easy.

473
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Erotic love is not aimless pleasure seeking.

474
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,520
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness,

475
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,480
to traverse the lonely void that separates us from each other,

476
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,040
to liberate repressed energy,

477
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,320
to feel alive.

478
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
Love is not the flesh.

479
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,280
It's not temptation.

480
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,880
It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face.

481
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
It's nothing like being an alcoholic.

482
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
It's not a craving.

483
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,120
It's a yearning.

484
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,920
The desire for reunion with our other half, Aristophanes.

485
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,040
But you people don't understand that

486
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,400
because you are vulgarians.

487
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
You have no sense of humanity

488
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,480
and you have no sense of the erotic.

489
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
Well, that sounds like a bunch of liberal Marxist bullcrap.

490
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,880
Jackie, your brain is so small.

491
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,800
It's just so tiny.

492
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,320
Look at me.

493
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
You're a dum-dum, okay?

494
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,440
And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

495
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,120
As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.

496
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,640
Jackie, I really am trying to silence you this time

497
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,880
because you're so stupid and I can't stand it anymore.

498
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,520
So shut up.

499
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm giving you the plague, liberal.

500
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
Okay, well, I hope it kills me because I'm done.

501
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,160
See, I'll never get sick because every day

502
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,120
I drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication.

503
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,760
Doctors don't want you to know about it.

504
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
I could not possibly be more done.

505
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,320
You may be done, but I'm not.

506
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, you people never are, are you?

507
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,360
You want to talk about yearning?

508
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,360
I mean, I get it.

509
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
I used to live in shame.

510
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,560
I know the insatiable longing to be with another woman.

511
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,080
Yes, we've all noticed.

512
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
Let me tell you, it is not freedom.

513
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,680
It is bondage.

514
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,960
You do not possess the flesh, Justin Tableau.

515
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,280
The flesh possesses you.

516
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,840
Rebuke it and be free or perish as a slave.

517
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
For the wages of sin is death,

518
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,400
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

519
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,440
You people do love to rebuke things, don't you?

520
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,760
Justin, the love you yearn for can only be found in Jesus.

521
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,680
Only he can fill the void.

522
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,120
I know.

523
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,360
I used to be like you, Justin.

524
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,400
I was lost.

525
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
I was blind.

526
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,920
I was confused in my identity.

527
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,400
I used to reject the gospel until my sin took everything from me

528
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
and I needed a savior.

529
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
And then I called out to God for salvation

530
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,320
and he came to me as a loving father.

531
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,040
It's not too late for you, Justin.

532
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
You are so loved.

533
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,040
God loves you.

534
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,160
But this?

535
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
This is not God's intent for you.

536
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
It is ridiculous to me that you think you know God's intent.

537
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,680
The height of cosmological narcissism.

538
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
I'm sorry, has Reddit gone offline?

539
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
Have we run out of fedoras in America?

540
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm just trying to understand why you hate God.

541
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,160
I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

542
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,040
God is love.

543
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Is he the only love worth having?

544
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,160
What you call love, the sin I used to live in,

545
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,480
the world, the flesh, and the devil,

546
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,040
that only ever brought me pain.

547
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,360
Yes, because heartbreak is painful.

548
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,120
Love is painful.

549
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,280
The poets are unanimous.

550
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,000
Love is bittersweet, says Sappho.

551
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Eros, giver of pain.

552
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
What's Sappho?

553
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
A pagan pornographer.

554
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,400
The sort of filth these people want to teach to children.

555
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is,

556
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,680
then goddammit, I don't know who can.

557
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, God for one.

558
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,560
God has a sexual plan for all of us.

559
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,280
That's odd.

560
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,640
God's plan is for male and female to be one flesh.

561
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,080
Men's and women's bodies fit together

562
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,000
for the purpose of creating children.

563
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right?

564
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,560
Seminal fluids are not difficult to come by,

565
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,760
even in this economy.

566
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,480
You have a guy?

567
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,640
A semen guy?

568
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
That's just most guys.

569
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics,

570
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,480
but since I'm among heathens, clearly,

571
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,840
I will do my best to argue not from faith,

572
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,760
but from reason.

573
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,880
I love reason.

574
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,440
Do you?

575
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,120
Tell me this, Justin.

576
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
Which is better?

577
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
A love that is eternal?

578
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
Or a love that can be ripped away at any moment?

579
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,

580
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,280
that must have been really hard.

581
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,800
Just answer the question.

582
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,240
Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

583
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,120
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes.

584
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Isn't a love that is eternal

585
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,920
superior to a love that is fleeting?

586
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
Yes, Socrates, it is certain.

587
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
And don't you yearn?

588
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,960
Not just for a love in the moment,

589
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,000
but for a love that lasts eternity?

590
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,880
Yes, Socrates, that is evident.

591
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,640
And isn't eternal love what we call God?

592
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,800
Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

593
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,280
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

594
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,080
So you have no argument.

595
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,200
Do I really need an argument?

596
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,840
This is just a semantic trick.

597
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
You're saying that God is eternal love,

598
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,400
and then magically that must exist

599
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,200
because you defined it that way?

600
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,800
So you don't have an argument?

601
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,480
I'm sorry.

602
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,040
Interesting.

603
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,560
I didn't prepare to have a debate

604
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,520
about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo

605
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
cosplaying as a trad wife.

606
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm supposed to take this seriously?

607
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,940
Why?

608
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
Why am I even here?

609
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,000
What am I doing?

610
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
Why am I talking to these people?

611
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,160
I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

612
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,800
I don't think God leads people to podcasts.

613
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,160
Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

614
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,360
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside.

615
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,080
There's a hunger in your soul.

616
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,040
No pleasure of the flesh can satisfy.

617
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,720
Do you not feel the thirst in your body

618
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,040
like a parched land?

619
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,600
Well, yeah, I feel the thirst.

620
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

621
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,280
If I may quote Psalm 63.

622
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,000
Please don't.

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
You, God, are my God.

624
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Earnestly, I seek you.

625
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
I thirst for you.

626
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,560
My whole being longs for you

627
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,920
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

628
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,600
Because your love is better than life,

629
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
my lips will glorify you.

630
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,680
I will praise you as long as I live.

631
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,520
And in your name, I will raise up my hands.

632
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,560
I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods.

633
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,560
With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.

634
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,040
Virginia, go to therapy.

635
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,920
Says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman.

636
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,680
You're the one who needs to go to therapy.

637
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,800
Now you go to therapy.

638
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,640
I'll pray for you.

639
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,920
I'll pray for you.

640
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,680
I will pray straight to Satan.

641
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Look, can't we just agree that we're all a little Looney Tunes?

642
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
You have your Jesus bullshit.

643
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,120
You have your gender nonsense.

644
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,360
And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

645
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
The free market, right.

646
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,240
We all have our little delusions.

647
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
The important thing is that we cling to them

648
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,680
and we never let go no matter how much evidence gets in the way.

649
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,840
Because that's what makes us free.

650
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,920
And freedom is what makes America great.

651
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,560
Other countries, they don't have choices.

652
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,160
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want.

653
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,320
So can we do drugs?

654
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,240
No, that's illegal.

655
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,680
I thought you said we could choose.

656
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Yes, but we have to make the right choices.

657
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,200
And what if we want to make the wrong choices?

658
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,400
Well, the boot of the law will crush you without mercy.

659
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,440
You will be locked in a tiny cage that is literally the opposite of freedom.

660
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Well, we have to be tough on crime.

661
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
It's the only way to keep this country free.

662
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,240
We have to build more prisons.

663
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,920
Who decides what the right and wrong choices are?

664
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,600
Well, Father decides.

665
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,120
Father always decides.

666
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,280
And do you always do what Father says?

667
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,240
Of course, we always do what Father says.

668
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Why?

669
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,000
Because Father says so.

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,640
Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep with men?

671
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,160
Oh, I don't want to sleep with men.

672
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,200
Yes, you do.

673
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
You're a man who struggles with gender confusion and same-sex temptation.

674
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,760
No, I'm not.

675
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl.

676
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,480
My heart was also broken by a woman.

677
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,400
I thought she was a cat girl.

678
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
She turned out to be a fuckboy.

679
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
You are a straight man.

680
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, at this point, I wish.

681
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,440
But no, definitely a gay woman.

682
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
We're all stuck with it.

683
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Hold on.

684
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,640
So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman.

685
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,520
Does that mean you're attracted to yourself?

686
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,080
No.

687
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,520
In the mirror?

688
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,200
No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference

689
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,680
between my own reflection and a different person.

690
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,120
Desire is always for something that you lack.

691
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,000
You can't desire yourself because you're already one with yourself.

692
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,280
Desire feeds on absence.

693
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,600
It reaches out across a void.

694
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,560
I don't know.

695
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,000
I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

696
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
Okay, well, thank you for sharing.

697
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,040
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgendered?

698
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,400
Do you have bodies in your basement?

699
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
You better watch out or you're gonna be next.

700
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,280
Are those clothes even yours?

701
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,640
Or are you wearing the clothes of your victims?

702
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,440
Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver,

703
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,720
and I will feast upon it.

704
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,920
Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts.

705
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,880
It's not enough for you to possess a woman.

706
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,320
You also have to appropriate female beauty for yourself.

707
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,120
Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia?

708
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,520
You're the one who keeps bringing that up.

709
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,320
Nice.

710
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,040
Got her!

711
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,320
Shut up, dum-dum.

712
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,880
I said it to hurt her and not to entertain you.

713
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,840
You stay out of this.

714
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,440
Look, so you're a straight man.

715
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,680
You could have had a wife.

716
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,840
You could have raised a family.

717
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,080
Your life could have meant something.

718
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,920
But you threw it all away?

719
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,880
You really think having babies is the only way to have a meaningful life?

720
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,720
Do you have babies?

721
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
Well, priests don't have babies.

722
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
Maybe think of queer people as priests.

723
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,440
Except, you know, the people we have sex with are adults.

724
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,800
Whoa, okay.

725
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,240
That's Catholics.

726
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,120
That's not Christians.

727
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Just kind of crossing a line, don't you think?

728
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,040
Oh, has free speech gone too far?

729
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
Now it's gone too far.

730
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,520
Can we have a civil conversation, please?

731
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Is it impossible to have a civil conversation in America today?

732
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,400
Well, that ship has sailed and sunk.

733
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,080
Virginia, I believe you are about to exercise Christian humility

734
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,120
by explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more meaningful than mine.

735
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,240
I walk with the spirit until the day I go to glory.

736
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,680
That's my meaning.

737
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,280
Your meaning is what?

738
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,560
To fabricate an already fading illusion of feminine beauty

739
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
until you rot away unresurrected in the earth?

740
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,560
And for what?

741
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,160
To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

742
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,040
Anything else would be a lie.

743
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,280
If God exists, I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours.

744
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,640
And with or without your approval and understanding,

745
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,520
I will always be the way I am.

746
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,760
Look, can't we reach a reasonable compromise?

747
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,680
I think you should have the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into.

748
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,920
Just leave children out of it.

749
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,800
Like, whatever this is, keep this away from children.

750
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,960
And that's why we should increase police funding to fight the war on drugs.

751
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,920
Listen, Justin, I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are.

752
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,480
I know my place in this world.

753
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,240
I've found love, family, belonging, fellowship in the church.

754
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,720
Have you found fellowship in the LGBT2A$ community?

755
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
Well, obviously not.

756
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,360
Because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other, case in point.

757
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,720
Though you are one of the worst I've ever seen.

758
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,840
So, you're alone, you're far from God's grace, and you have no catgirl gf.

759
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,200
Can you honestly say that you're happy?

760
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,760
That you're fulfilled?

761
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,320
That you have purpose?

762
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,320
That you have hope?

763
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,520
Justin.

764
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
Justin.

765
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,760
Justin.

766
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,120
Justin.

767
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
Justin.

768
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,160
Hello?

769
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
Justin.

770
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,240
Hello?

771
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,480
Jesus!

772
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,840
Ha!

773
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,680
Don't say that name in front of me.

774
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
How did you get in my house?

775
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,120
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

776
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,640
Who are you?

777
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,600
What are you?

778
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,680
Well, I used to be an angel.

779
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,600
And now?

780
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,320
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

781
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,760
A satanic visitation at this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the

782
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,440
country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

783
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,720
Yes.

784
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

785
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,880
Do you want it to be?

786
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,760
No.

787
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,280
Look, I've had a terrible day.

788
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,600
I'm really not in the mood for this.

789
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,920
Well, I can help you with that.

790
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Can you?

791
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,080
Sure.

792
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,600
I can help with anything.

793
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:28,400
Depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, boredom, failure, shame.

794
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Shame?

795
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,920
Is it the shame?

796
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Well, yeah, there's the shame.

797
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,080
There's always going to be the shame.

798
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
But it's a complex cocktail.

799
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,880
There's the heartbreak, there's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

800
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm a parched landloose.

801
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
I've got the hunger.

802
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,680
The emptiness inside.

803
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
Oh, emptiness inside.

804
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,320
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

805
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

806
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,200
It's not a weird sex thing.

807
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,280
Potions, Justine.

808
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
Potions.

809
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

810
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,920
Potions?

811
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,200
Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

812
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,760
Think of me as a salesman, an apothecary.

813
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
A dealer.

814
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
Are you trying to get demonetized?

815
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,440
Sorry.

816
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,520
What potions do you have?

817
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Well, this is one of my favorites.

818
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,160
It's called hype.

819
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
This will make you come alive.

820
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
You'll jump right out of your shell.

821
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,360
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

822
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,520
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

823
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
You'll finally get things done.

824
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,920
You'll connect with people.

825
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,680
You'll always know just what to say.

826
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

827
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,200
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

828
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,800
Pain?

829
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,640
Well, I surely have something for that.

830
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,600
It's called void.

831
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,400
One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.

832
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,480
The aches of the body, the agitation of desire,

833
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,480
the sting of heartbreak, boredom, grief, and shame.

834
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket

835
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,360
of serenity and love.

836
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,680
Yes, I know what void is, but that's a very hard potion.

837
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,720
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

838
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

839
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,840
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness

840
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,840
all alone?

841
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
What, do you need a clear mind to process

842
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,080
how bad you were on that podcast?

843
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,240
Because it was embarrassing, humiliating.

844
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,560
Honestly, it was difficult to watch.

845
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,360
Shut up.

846
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Is it some kind of masochism?

847
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,320
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

848
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,160
Because you're not impressing anyone.

849
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

850
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,000
You're going to sit around stalking your ex

851
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,840
on social media all night?

852
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Because that is pathetic.

853
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,720
And it's so unnecessary, because you're

854
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,280
choosing to feel bad, when with one drop of void,

855
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,280
you can be in bliss.

856
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,000
Pass.

857
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,440
The cool kids are doing it.

858
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,360
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it,

859
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,120
because it's not the 90s.

860
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,760
Kids today are vaping Benadryl.

861
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,200
Don't you keep up with this?

862
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,240
OK, I mean, I respect your choice,

863
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,440
but I'm not going anywhere.

864
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,920
I will stay right here.

865
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,960
And I will remind you every minute,

866
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,520
for hundreds of consecutive minutes,

867
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,360
that your pain is optional.

868
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,880
And I have the antidote right here.

869
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,240
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain, and shame,

870
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:12,880
and humiliation, and heartbreak, and boredom, loneliness,

871
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:22,960
despair, disappointment, failure, anguish, frustration.

872
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,760
Look, I'm a smart person, OK?

873
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,280
And I'm not going to let you turn me

874
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,080
into some kind of pathetic junkie.

875
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,760
Pathetic?

876
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,840
Is it pathetic to feel good?

877
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,160
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

878
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,560
And to me, that's pathetic.

879
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:53,840
Well, the thing about that, it's OK.

880
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,440
Just give me the goddamn void.

881
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,840
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

882
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,920
I thought I was going to be here all night.

883
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Well, my will is weak, OK?

884
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
Can I have the potion, please?

885
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,000
All right, well, let's be a little patient.

886
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,840
You should really do this the right way, OK?

887
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,520
It's called harm reduction.

888
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,960
What you're going to do is put one drop, and only one drop,

889
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,080
of pure void into water.

890
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,840
This is important.

891
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,480
Do not do too many drops.

892
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,560
What happens if I do too many drops?

893
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
Oh, you'll probably die.

894
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,920
I'll die?

895
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,760
I told you it was important.

896
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,920
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

897
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,160
Well, it's difficult to say exactly.

898
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,760
It depends on a lot of factors.

899
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,600
Seriously?

900
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,000
But it's your first time, so just do one.

901
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,400
So do I just drink it, or?

902
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,600
Of course you drink it.

903
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
It's a purely fictional magical potion,

904
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,560
utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.

905
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,160
What else would you do with it?

906
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,660
OK.

907
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,680
Good girl.

908
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,160
I don't feel anything.

909
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,760
OK, well, give it a minute.

910
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,920
In about 15 seconds, you are not going

911
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,600
to know the meaning of the word pain.

912
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,480
Are you ready for that?

913
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,960
Lucy, I have never been more ready for anything.

914
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,240
And my goddamn...

915
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,800
There she goes.

916
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,800
Thank god.

917
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,280
Well, don't thank god.

918
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,840
Thank me.

919
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,600
I will not have father taking credit for my work.

920
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:34,240
Lucy?

921
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,260
Lucy?

922
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,800
Luciferia?

923
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,220
Mother?

924
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,040
A doctor?

925
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,200
Mother doctor?

926
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,000
Doctor mother?

927
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,600
Mom?

928
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,440
Mother void?

929
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,240
Mother void?

930
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,660
Yes?

931
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,840
Help me, doctor.

932
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,160
I'm being cancelled.

933
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,160
Oh, so a bunch of furries are mad at you online.

934
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,960
So what?

935
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,360
You don't understand, doctor.

936
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,680
I'm in love with this furry.

937
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,560
You really are far from god.

938
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,640
You're further from god than I am.

939
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,440
Lucy, can I get a drop?

940
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,040
A drop.

941
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,560
I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.

942
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,760
Doctor, my pain is at a 10.

943
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,840
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again.

944
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,760
I'm a little disappointed, honestly.

945
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,400
I enjoy the thrill of the chase.

946
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,160
But there's no chase with you.

947
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,600
No chase at all.

948
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,200
You're easy.

949
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,160
An easy little void slut.

950
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,760
A slut for the void.

951
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,160
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy.

952
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,440
Please, just give me the void so I can fill the emptiness.

953
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,800
If it's the void you want, the void you shall have.

954
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,520
But you don't call me Lucy anymore, understand?

955
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,440
You call me mommy now.

956
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,720
Because I own you.

957
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,520
Yes, mommy dearest.

958
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,320
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.

959
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,160
Five drops already.

960
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,400
Escalating, aren't we?

961
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,120
Well yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

962
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,080
So you're going to do five drops?

963
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,360
Just to take the edge off.

964
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,520
I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.

965
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,520
Oh wow, if it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument.

966
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,600
By all means, continue.

967
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,200
Well, thank you for being supportive.

968
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,000
Cheers.

969
00:50:46,160 --> 00:51:05,600
That was, that was dumb.

970
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,720
That was so dumb.

971
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:21,760
I need to quit.

972
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,520
I've got to quit.

973
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm going to quit.

974
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,240
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

975
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,960
Yes, Mother.

976
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,120
I'm going to quit.

977
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,440
Good luck.

978
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,720
Good luck.

979
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,160
I'll quit after one more drop.

980
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,880
Of course.

981
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,640
All right, that's it.

982
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,920
Never again.

983
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,480
I'm quitting.

984
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,320
I quit.

985
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,320
I quit.

986
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:07,680
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

987
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:23,840
How hard could that be?

988
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:36,800
No, I can't do this.

989
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,320
I can't do this.

990
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:49,840
Shit, shit.

991
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,240
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

992
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,680
Lucy, Lucy.

993
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,600
Lucy, I want to sleep.

994
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,800
Wake up, Lucy.

995
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,160
Lucy, wake up.

996
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,840
Wake up!

997
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:11,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

998
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

999
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:43,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1000
00:54:43,840 --> 00:55:03,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1001
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1002
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1003
00:55:43,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1004
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1005
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:43,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1006
00:56:43,840 --> 00:57:03,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.

1007
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Lucy, Lucy, wake up.
