0	19640	Hello my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here
19640	24600	to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing.
24600	29920	There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime.
29920	30920	Ugh.
30920	34360	So if that's going to make you sad, please don't watch this.
34360	37720	Unless you enjoy sadness, I know I do.
37720	42880	But your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made you a wet
42880	48520	pot of hot tea, and you can take it out on the balcony and pour it on some pedestrians.
48520	51320	That always cheers me up!
51320	54080	1.
54080	60120	Traps Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to
60120	64920	submit to you the findings of my latest memetic research.
64920	70080	Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing
70080	76960	volumes ancient and modern, in search of the answer to two fundamental questions.
76960	81480	What are traps, and be they gay?
81480	87240	With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady
87240	93400	scholar known as the pedantic Romantic, wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced
93400	96920	to patrons of animated pictures from the Orient.
96920	97920	Curious.
97920	103160	The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture
103160	108680	forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral
108680	113840	Ackbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.
113840	120080	Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic japonesques,
120080	123920	to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined.
123920	128880	The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in soothe a daughter
128880	135160	of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite
135160	136160	skullduggery.
136680	142480	Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only
142480	145800	transvestites, but transsexuals as well.
145800	151760	And this must needs be remarked, for tis evident such persons oft times inflame the lust of
151760	153000	ordinary men.
153000	159280	It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus, fellas, is
159280	160280	it gay?
160280	164000	I'm sorry, who are you talking to?
164040	169480	Gentlemen of the Academy, did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again?
169480	173160	It must needs be remarked.
173160	174800	Please stop breaking into my house.
174800	177880	I shall be the Queen of Dairy.
177880	179400	I'm sure you will be.
183040	184040	Cross-dresser.
184040	187600	Hi, I'm Natalie Wynn, biological woman.
187600	193000	Can we pan the camera down, my hair is less high.
195000	197280	Are traps gay?
197280	199160	The meme, that will not die.
199160	204040	Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male cross-dresser
204040	208640	or a trans woman, especially in a context of neotenous kawaii decadence.
208640	213560	The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men attracted
213560	216280	to dick girls, food nari, mtfs.
216280	219640	You know, a lot of these men don't know or care about the difference between a trans
219640	223600	woman and a cross-dresser, so it's kind of pointless to get hung up on that.
223600	227520	The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago, when someone released the worst specimens
227520	229920	of the white race into the wild.
229920	231480	Are traps gay?
231480	233400	One of life's most important questions.
233400	235360	Are traps gay?
235360	239760	Traps are gay, uh, you know, uh, yes.
239760	246000	Will there be transsexuals in the ethnic state, uh, uh, hopefully not.
246000	249000	To the men who meme about this topic, it's all lighthearted fun.
249000	253240	It's part of a wider game they like to play called Is It Gay, you know, is it gay to have
253240	256280	an mmf threesome only if the balls touch?
256280	257560	Don't cross the streams.
257560	258560	And so on.
258560	262600	But to many trans women, the meme and the word trap itself are highly offensive.
262600	267280	In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans people
267280	271480	on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this topic is just too harmful to even
271480	272480	discuss.
272480	274640	So here's the challenge I face making this video.
274640	277640	On the one hand, there's people who are going to be upset and offended that I'm making a
277640	281400	video about this topic at all, and on the other hand, there are people who think this
281400	285320	is all just harmless otaku shitposting and who are going to be annoyed by my trigger
285320	286320	warnings.
286320	289720	But first, to the people who think it's too offensive, here's what I have to say for myself.
289720	293480	I've always believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where they're
293480	294480	at.
294480	297440	And in this case, rtrapsgay is where people are at.
297440	301040	At one of my YouTube meetups I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard
301040	304800	some of his male students joking in the hallway about rtrapsgay.
304800	309000	When those teenage boys go home and google rtrapsgay, who do you want to explain it to
309000	310000	them?
310000	315560	This is our Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula,
315560	316560	or this tran.
316560	320280	And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me.
320280	323200	You know, as trans women, we have little influence in society.
323200	326840	The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are, so
326840	329280	we're like a jogger racing against a car.
329280	332040	The only way to win is to hijack the car.
332040	337560	And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having
337560	338560	about us.
338680	344000	As always, my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion from edgy premises, to shitpost
344000	345840	my way to the moral high ground.
345840	350680	Now, straight men, isn't all this offense-taking just more politically correct cuckoldry designed
350680	352240	to take away your free speech?
352240	356320	Well, I assure you there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel.
356320	358600	Unless you clock my makeup, dickbag!
358600	359880	Comment deleted!
359880	365320	But, if you want to know why trans women are offended by rtrapsgay, I'm happy to tell you.
365320	370120	Not to silence you, of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to
370120	375000	want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that seems harmless
375000	376000	to you.
376000	379560	So, well, let's put it this way.
379560	380960	2.
380960	383040	Trans Panic
383040	388160	The 1990 documentary Paris is Burning depicts the ball culture of Black and Latinx gay and
388160	391600	transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s.
391600	396160	One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Extravaganza, who describes
396160	398520	her precarious existence as a sex worker.
398520	404280	I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties until he touched me down there.
404280	407480	He felt it and he seen it and he like totally flipped out.
407480	412360	He said, you fucking faggot, you're a freak, you're a victim of AIDS and you're trying
412360	413360	to give me AIDS?
413360	414360	What are you, crazy?
414360	415360	You're a homo.
415360	416360	I should kill you.
416360	421720	I was really terrified, so I just jumped out the window.
421720	426400	During the filming of Paris is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.
426400	429600	Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.
429600	434240	Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully
434240	437960	high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.
437960	442200	The men who murder trans women often claim they were provoked to violence by the alleged
442200	444040	deception of their victims.
444040	449600	This is what's called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial
449600	453040	of the killers of the teenage trans girl Gwen Araujo.
453040	456480	One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried,
456480	460080	I can't be fucking gay, before beating her to death.
460080	464280	Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don't want to get
464280	466360	murdered, then they shouldn't trick men.
466360	470960	But what you have to understand is, first, men usually do know when they're having sex
470960	471960	with a trans woman.
471960	476200	Like, if you have a dick, it's pretty hard, actually, to have sex with someone and have
476200	477640	them not notice it.
477640	483200	And second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence as itself a kind of trickery.
483200	487800	A black trans woman named Ilan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose
487800	490360	friends had mocked him for flirting with her.
490360	494680	All she did to provoke him was walk down the street with two friends.
494680	499240	The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive
499240	503720	of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight.
503720	508520	But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across
508520	511400	class and race experience some version of.
511400	518440	Because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation
518440	519880	to a proboscis.
519880	523960	I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at
523960	528440	a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans and then punched
528440	529440	her.
529440	532440	Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home?
532440	537160	For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our
537160	538160	freedom.
538160	542400	There's bars I won't go into, because I don't trust the clientele to side with me if some
542400	543880	shit like that goes down.
543880	548240	And I've had little scares, I was in the back of an Uber once and the driver comes on a
548240	551640	little flirty, you know, what's your name, are you a student?
551640	555480	And I'm thinking wow, he thinks I'm young enough to be a student!
555520	560600	But at some point he goes silent, and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare in the rearview
560600	565680	mirror, like fucking clocked, and for a second I'm like fuck, I'm gonna die in the back of
565680	566800	this car.
566800	571120	And of course I didn't die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine.
571120	576240	I mean I'm gonna be fine, because white middle-class transsexuals don't get murdered in this country.
576240	580760	The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it's really
580760	582560	not my oppression to claim.
582560	586200	You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle-class, computer programmer trans women
586200	590040	be like, we're getting murdered in the streets, who's we?
590040	592120	It's not white, middle-class trans women.
592120	596640	So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane, it exists at this intersection
596640	600640	of masculinity and race, and that's really not a conversation that should be led by a
600640	607440	white woman, especially when there's so, so, so many things to critique about white masculinity.
607440	609640	Let's talk about some now.
609640	610640	3.
610640	611640	Taking Offense
611720	614000	Okay, back to traps.
614000	615400	Now this is my lane.
615400	617800	I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.
617800	622480	Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox.
622480	627640	So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom is abridged by our need to navigate
627640	633440	around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence, as a kind of trap.
633440	637760	I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans of
637760	641240	you using that word for us, or for foodinari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.
641240	647160	I mean to be honest, if someone calls me a trap, my response is more like, wow, a transphobe
647160	648480	thought I looked like a woman.
648480	652320	But that's because I'm so pathetic I have to go dumpster diving for validation, but
652320	656480	the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity and self-respect, you should
656480	658320	definitely not call them traps.
658320	661760	Of course, some trans women will overstate the case and say the word trap is literally
661760	666680	getting trans women killed, which, I can't find any examples of the word trap being connected
666680	671680	to a murder, but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm?
671680	675280	Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps is you're showing that you think
675280	679200	of us the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us.
679200	683360	When a man kills a trans woman, literally the argument he trots out in court is that
683360	684640	he was trapped.
684640	689120	And that's what you're reminding us of when you use that word, and that's why trans women
689120	690360	are getting triggered over it.
690360	694360	You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is
694360	695720	one of those times.
695760	699720	So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now.
699720	703880	I think I've made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended
703880	705160	by the word trap.
705160	710200	But, if I leave it at that, and this is for you Twitter, this is why I'm making this video,
710200	714600	if I simply argue that rTrapsK is offensive, then here's what happens.
714600	717080	First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit.
717080	720760	In fact, me telling them it's offensive only makes them want to say it more, because they
720760	725960	feel on a deep level that they are by nature superior to trans people, so an uppity tranny
725960	729400	telling them what words they're allowed to say completely enrages them.
729400	733800	So they'll comment, traps are gay, lol, just to reaffirm their superiority over me and
733800	737680	that I have no power or influence over them, and there's really nothing I can do about
737680	738680	those people.
738680	744560	But, another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they'll say, okay,
744560	748160	so since you're offended by it, I won't say the word trap anymore, and they'll be super
748160	752400	woke about it, and they'll post Twitter callouts canceling anyone who uses the word trap, and
752400	757440	they'll be very respectful and compassionate toward trans people in public, so long as
757440	762960	it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic third world country of a gender minority.
762960	768160	But then, they'll go home at night, and in that twilight between consciousness and sleep,
768160	772080	their inner voice will whisper, but rTrapsK.
772080	776720	And then, years later, when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend, we'll suddenly
776720	781400	watch all that shallow wokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapor.
781400	785280	Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.
785280	792320	So it's not enough for me to argue that rTrapsGay is offensive, I also have to argue…
792320	795080	whether traps are gay.
795080	797360	So… rTrapsGay?
797360	800400	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
800960	815400	🎵
815400	819400	4. The Philosopher
819400	824120	Hello boys, it is I, the half-queen, points.
824120	829160	After thirty days and thirty nights, the Philosopher descended from the mountaintop into the gathered
829200	831080	villagers, thus spake.
831080	836040	R. Traps. Gay, said he, to whom the half-queen thus replied.
836040	840640	Hmm, let's see, let me think about it, oh.
840640	846320	I'm gonna stop saying trap now, because it's not a good word, as has been explained,
846320	848560	in fact it's really best to read it like a slur.
848560	853040	So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans
853040	854760	woman, is that gay?
854760	859800	Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are women, and a man having sex with
859800	866040	a woman is, um, let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted, it is not
866040	867040	in fact gay.
867040	870760	But that's not the most persuasive answer, because in order to find it convincing, you
870760	873640	already have to believe that trans women are women.
873640	877560	And unfortunately if you ask the average person about this, what they say is something like
877920	884720	Sure, I think trans women are women, but they shouldn't expect men to want to date them
884720	887400	unless they're into that sort of thing.
887400	888400	Oh?
888400	892000	And what sort of thing is that?
892000	895320	Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman and you say oh what's she like and
895320	901760	he says she's from Cincinnati, your response is not, oh David, I didn't realize you
901760	904480	were into that sort of thing.
904480	909720	In other words, these people tell you trans women are women, but, and then they say something
909720	913600	that shows they don't really think trans women are women at all.
913600	918880	So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular
918880	923680	reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay because trans women
923680	928960	are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that's being disputed.
928960	934120	So maybe the observational approach is better, the facts are indisputable, many heterosexual
934120	937800	men are attracted to trans women, and comparatively few gay men are.
937800	942160	Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the
942160	943160	world.
943160	948320	We know who's attracted to us and who isn't, so to us this completely unnecessary debate
948320	952400	is as impractical as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow.
952400	957320	Sure, philosophers can say, but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow, to which
957320	962240	the correct response is shut the fuck up nerd, stop playing 3D chess against your own brain,
962240	963720	and find a real thing to worry about.
963720	967600	It's just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and to trans
967600	972080	women it's a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us are people
972080	973960	who are attracted to women.
973960	978480	Of the cis men I've been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight and
978480	982320	all had only ever been with cis women until this tran came along.
982320	986900	Am I really so powerful a seductress that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over
986900	988120	these tiny tits?
988120	991480	Let's not get cocky.
991480	995800	I mean if a man is attracted to women and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman
995800	1000040	and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then he continues being
1000040	1004760	attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything but a straight man?
1004760	1009000	What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay?
1009000	1013200	Well we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious.
1013200	1014920	What about the penis?
1014920	1017600	Ah yes, the penis.
1017600	1020080	Look baby we'll get to the penis, don't you worry about that.
1020360	1025320	But first I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas,
1025320	1026320	because they got five.
1030320	1034320	In fact I've been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is I make too
1034320	1039440	much money for Medicaid now so I have to form an LLC, become my own employer so I can give
1039440	1042240	myself health benefits, and ugh it's so much paperwork.
1042240	1046000	You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a fucking
1046000	1047000	cunt.
1047040	1051120	Because transphobic radical feminists will say it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,
1051120	1053640	because a real vagina is a sacred passage.
1053640	1057840	And that's fine by me, what am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered
1057840	1058840	by the Pope?
1058840	1059840	Pass.
1059840	1063560	Straight men don't get hung up on this, I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought
1063560	1067800	of a vagina as a sacred passage, they're either grossed out by it or they're trying to climb
1067800	1068800	inside.
1068800	1072360	What I'm trying to say is, in the past I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina
1072360	1077040	because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad and besides, chicks with dicks are very in
1077040	1081760	right now, very 2019, very trending, and being a dick girl it's kind of like being a legendary
1081760	1083200	Pokemon, you know?
1083200	1087040	People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn't that what we all want?
1087040	1092240	But unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery because, well, guys can
1092240	1094240	I confess something kind of dark to you?
1094240	1101160	I have this really fucked up fetish where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.
1101160	1102160	Crazy right?
1102160	1105520	I mean I like anal, but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.
1105520	1106520	Ew.
1106520	1109560	I don't want to eat well, I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked,
1109560	1110560	is that a crime?
1110560	1113280	It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks?
1113280	1117920	I'm afraid I have some bad news, the tests are back and are showing that, in the medical
1117920	1121480	terminology, your vagina does indeed suck.
1121480	1125360	The point is, the easy sell version of the argument I'm making is that there's nothing
1125360	1129960	homosexual about a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years,
1129960	1135280	she has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she's giving hair body face,
1135280	1137040	she's post-op and has a vagina.
1137040	1141080	Now even in this situation, people will still say it's gay because of the chromosomes.
1141080	1146080	But look, human beings have five senses, and none of them can detect chromosomes.
1146080	1150520	Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender, it's based on perception.
1150520	1154720	And if you're a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you're attracted to her as
1154720	1158120	a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment my dude.
1158120	1159720	Congratulations, you're a breeder.
1159720	1164920	Now the argument people make is, okay fine, it's straight if you mistake her for a biological
1164920	1170600	woman, but if you know she's a man and you're still attracted, then it's gaaaaaaaaaaay.
1170600	1174640	So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with
1174640	1178360	your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and
1178360	1179800	your sexual response.
1179800	1184360	But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only if you
1184360	1188760	value your identity as a straight man, you'll feel ashamed of your attraction, and you'll
1188760	1192640	try to fight and deny it, and you'll probably end up treating trans women like absolute
1192640	1193640	garbage.
1193640	1198000	Now if I wanted to make the SJW one-on-one type response here, I would say trans women
1198000	1200960	are women because they identify as women.
1200960	1206000	And so, every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction to a trans woman is necessarily
1206000	1211560	experiencing heterosexual attraction, because of the way the person he's attracted to identifies.
1212360	1215840	But that's just replacing the black and white thinking of a biology dogma with the
1215840	1218240	black and white thinking of an identity dogma.
1218240	1223360	But human sexuality is not black and white, it's not even shades of grey, it's a multi-color
1223360	1227680	acid trip, it's centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.
1227680	1232520	So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it's not usually based on psychological
1232520	1233920	identity either.
1233920	1238400	Most of the time, initial attraction anyway is based on what I'd call presentation, how
1238400	1239400	you look and act.
1239640	1243080	And I think that's especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual
1243080	1244080	pop.
1244080	1245720	They see, they conquer, they cum.
1245720	1248080	I mean you have to admire the simplicity of it.
1248080	1250280	Sometimes I wish I were a man.
1250280	1255240	So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans
1255240	1256400	women who pop.
1256400	1260200	Maybe you don't think I pop, but you'd be hard-pressed to argue that any number of trans
1260200	1263880	models and actresses don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.
1263880	1266960	So the pop is undeniable, no one's questioning the pop.
1266960	1271000	In fact, without the pop, it never would've occurred to men to call trans women traps,
1271000	1274720	because they wouldn't be trapped if they weren't attracted in the first place.
1274720	1279120	But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans woman,
1279120	1283600	is some kind of illusion or facade that at some point will be dropped, revealing that
1283600	1286240	our womanhood is a sham and that we're really men.
1286240	1290100	Now here's a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.
1290100	1294240	If you date a cis drag queen, at some point, you're getting a manhoney.
1294240	1297160	As explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters.
1297160	1300640	I don't want to date nobody who want to date me like this, because this comes off.
1300640	1303720	And you're not doing nothing with this.
1303720	1308120	But if you date me, there's no de-dragging, there's no moment where I become a man.
1308120	1310520	Baby, what you see is what you got.
1310520	1313200	At least on this side, this is my natural side.
1313200	1315520	And this is my biological side.
1315520	1318520	When we're discussing people who are trans, we immediately say in the first paragraph
1318520	1321520	trans woman, and then we're personified by their biological pronoun, because biology
1321520	1324120	is the nature of the pronoun, so.
1324120	1328040	Everyone's always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine, so why
1328040	1330840	do you think that in the bedroom we'd be any other way?
1330840	1334400	Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what
1334400	1335680	it does for trans women.
1335680	1340560	It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts.
1340560	1344640	That's right, these are my very real, very biological titties.
1344640	1347960	I mean I'm wearing a push-up bra, but at least there's something to push up now.
1347960	1349160	Here, I'll show you.
1349160	1354800	I mean they're small, but it's not by any measure a male chest, and what I have
1354800	1358840	is very real, very biological, and very female.
1358840	1361760	You people think everything to do with trans women is fake.
1361760	1364000	Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair.
1364000	1366120	But that's prejudice more than observation.
1366120	1370080	Like I've noticed that whether or not I actually wear a wig in a video has exactly
1370080	1374000	zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man in a wig.
1374000	1375000	So I may as well just wear wigs.
1375000	1378720	And I may as well get my boobs done too, since people are gonna call them fake either way.
1378800	1382680	But for what it's worth, this is my real hair, at least on this half, and these are
1382680	1383680	my real boobs.
1383680	1388200	And if I bring home a gentleman, or a lady, all that stays on in bed, and it's there
1388200	1389520	when I wake up in the morning.
1389520	1391280	But what about the penis?
1391280	1393200	Alright, alright, look.
1393200	1395600	If the penis is feminine, how is that gay?
1395600	1396600	I rest my case.
1396600	1397600	Roll credits.
1397600	1402720	You can't make me you.
1402720	1403720	6.
1403720	1405200	The Feminine Penis.
1405200	1407960	Look, some guys want the Ts and the D.
1408200	1409200	And that's the T.
1409200	1414040	Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a lady dick, makes any sexual
1414040	1415920	interaction with a man gay.
1415920	1422960	But isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men, and not merely to penises
1422960	1424360	wherever they may arise?
1424360	1429320	I think there probably are some gay men who really just like dick.
1429320	1432000	And I'm not judging, I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences.
1432000	1436960	But being a straight man, I don't really think that's best understood as a man attracted
1436960	1437960	to vaginas.
1437960	1442640	You call women pussy, but then you're always like ew, period, I'm a straight man, I'm
1442640	1446200	not used to putting a towel down when I fuck, I don't know how to use a condom because
1446200	1449520	I expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me.
1449520	1453920	And then you have straight incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on
1453920	1455680	a show of vaginal disgust.
1455680	1459440	I mean if you're gonna date cis women or post-op trans women, I think you owe it to
1459440	1461840	them to be a little more vagina positive.
1461840	1464840	Cause even though straight men are like ew dicks, that's gay.
1464840	1467000	You guys also kinda love dicks?
1467000	1468280	You're always drawing them?
1468280	1469960	Your buildings look like dicks?
1469960	1471640	Your porn all has dicks in it?
1471640	1473240	So what about dicks on chicks?
1473240	1477280	Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what's the problem officer?
1477280	1480600	I think the booming popularity of t-girl porn speaks for itself.
1480600	1485960	On Pornhub, the shemale category contains more videos than other such popular categories
1485960	1490960	as rough sex, orgy, and webcam, and it's mostly straight men who watch it.
1490960	1495640	When AdultEmpire.com moved their t-girl content from their gay site to their straight site,
1495640	1496640	views increased 50%.
1496640	1501920	In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom
1501920	1507240	bill, the adult site GameLink's top-selling titles in North Carolina were My Transsexual
1507240	1512720	Teacher, Shemale Shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Transvisions 6.
1512720	1517400	A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which isn't great
1517480	1523360	since most t-girl porn is not trans-positive and uses dehumanizing slurs like shemale and
1523360	1526760	tranny, which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk off
1526760	1529040	to you but won't give you rights.
1529040	1532120	So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.
1532120	1534360	Shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.
1534360	1535360	Great!
1535360	1536360	I love that for us.
1536360	1540560	Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick,
1540560	1541560	and you know what?
1541560	1542560	That's fine.
1542560	1546720	Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.
1546720	1547720	You like what you like.
1547720	1549600	I'm not here to police anyone's desires.
1549600	1551000	In fact, quite the opposite.
1551000	1556240	I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society's cruel and unjust prejudice
1556240	1558120	against their t-girl-loving ways.
1558120	1560520	But liberation begins with understanding.
1560520	1562880	So who are the men who love trans girls?
1562880	1566880	Well, according to trans women I've talked to and my own personal experience, the men
1566880	1570080	who date us can be divided into three general groups.
1570080	1575320	Group 1 are men who, to be honest, are actually kinda put off by the dick, but they're so
1575360	1579680	attracted to the woman it's attached to that they're willing to work around it, or wait
1579680	1582200	for it to grow on them.
1582200	1587520	Group 2 are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don't
1587520	1592280	specifically fetishize the penis, so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover had genital
1592280	1593880	reassignment and got a vagina.
1593880	1598720	And then group 3 are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want
1598720	1601160	to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.
1601160	1604520	Now group 3 are what the trans community calls chasers.
1604520	1609200	I think chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing
1609200	1613300	our genitals, which is often the part of us that we're most uncomfortable with.
1613300	1617480	So if you're a t-girl who likes men, group 2 is really Goldilocks perfection unless you
1617480	1620280	really like topping or you've had the surgery.
1620280	1624080	Now I should say that group 2 does include some bisexual men, and bisexual people of
1624080	1626720	either gender can be great partners if you're trans.
1626720	1630920	You like girls, you like dick, I'm a girl with a dick, let's make this happen.
1630920	1634520	That said, if someone views that part of me as male, and wants me to do with it what
1634520	1636600	men do with it, then pass.
1636600	1637600	Not interested.
1637600	1642480	Now, you might be wondering, what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?
1642480	1644520	How could I view it as anything other than a male part?
1644520	1646080	It's a fucking penis!
1646080	1647440	Well I'm glad you asked.
1647440	1653000	I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.
1653000	1655960	You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.
1655960	1658680	Context, usage, and physiology.
1658680	1660440	So first, context.
1660440	1663040	Picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.
1663040	1665040	Now, picture her with a penis.
1665040	1667960	That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.
1667960	1670800	It's feminine because of the context that it's in.
1670800	1672320	Second, usage.
1672320	1674520	A lesson in penis etiquette.
1674520	1677960	A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.
1677960	1682320	He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get
1682320	1686440	on your knees like a good girl and f***.
1686440	1693840	Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes
1693840	1694840	her penis.
1694840	1699840	When she rises from the bath, she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when not
1699840	1702760	in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.
1702760	1706280	Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.
1706280	1710880	The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.
1710880	1714760	This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character.
1714760	1720720	Next, you wanna take not one, but two pairs of cotton-lined, poly-spandex, bikini-cut
1720720	1726080	panties, at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs.
1726080	1729920	Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.
1729920	1734520	You're gonna take your claw, and you're gonna grab your scrotum, and you're gonna yank that
1734520	1736440	bubblegum back into your peach crease.
1736440	1741280	Now hold it back with one hand, and with your other hand, push your penis back, pressing
1741280	1743960	those little eggs up into your pelvis.
1743960	1748240	Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place, and then pull your panties up, front
1748240	1753480	first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing's seeping out the sides,
1753480	1755160	and then voila.
1755160	1756880	It's like it was never there.
1756880	1761040	For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new foreword
1761040	1762880	by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.
1762880	1767440	I've now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us now
1767440	1769140	turn to physiology.
1769140	1773360	Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and
1773360	1778320	functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down and softening everything up.
1778320	1783280	That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something
1783280	1788200	I've been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,
1788200	1793200	really get people talking about 7, the mouthfeel.
1793200	1803320	Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Wynn, your tasting specialist.
1803320	1812440	I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex, girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,
1812440	1816800	and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.
1816800	1820880	But today, we amuse the palate with the feminine penis.
1821040	1826800	Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine
1826800	1835280	penis and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami.
1835280	1840800	With respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the
1840800	1844360	masculine penis and does not become as turgid.
1844360	1851800	And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes
1851800	1857840	of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.
1857840	1865960	It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.
1865960	1866960	Cheers!
1866960	1875120	8.
1875120	1876600	Being straight is pretty gay.
1876600	1881760	So I've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately
1881760	1886960	you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with
1886960	1889360	a trans woman is sex with a woman.
1889360	1893880	Now we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.
1893880	1898440	Reality is complicated, and while it's undeniable that many straight men are attracted to trans
1898440	1905320	women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men are also attracted to male cross-dressers.
1905320	1909280	Before I transitioned I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super womanly either,
1909280	1911640	like fully Dr. Frankenfurter.
1911640	1913280	And that's why I'm so iconic.
1913280	1918320	I showed the world that in two years you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter
1918320	1922000	to a very real, very biological drag queen.
1922120	1928000	But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got semi-regular messages from men
1928000	1929000	being like,
1929000	1934080	So I'm a straight man, but I'm like really attracted to you when you dress as a woman
1934080	1937640	and it's really making me question my sexuality.
1937640	1940880	Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like,
1940880	1945320	Well maybe those men just picked up on my inherently womanly female energy essence that
1945320	1951680	I've always had since I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-dressing baby.
1951680	1952960	But let's be real.
1952960	1957000	There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers, there are straight men who fuck drag queens,
1957000	1961760	there are straight identifying men who fuck other straight identifying men.
1961760	1963040	What is going on here?
1963040	1964040	Straight men?
1964040	1965040	What is your deal?
1965040	1966040	Who are you?
1966040	1967040	What is your life?
1967040	1968040	How did you become straight?
1968040	1969040	Did they recruit you?
1969040	1970040	Were you groomed?
1970040	1971040	I blame the parents.
1971040	1974400	Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call Is This Gay?
1974400	1979400	The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they're sex acts between people
1979400	1980400	of the same gender.
1980640	1985120	But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's gay,
1985120	1988640	or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.
1988640	1993520	To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam's nipples,
1993520	1996000	and according to these men, it's totally gay.
1996000	2001120	What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a
2001120	2002160	man and a woman.
2002160	2006560	It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who
2006560	2008400	are playing the correct roles.
2008400	2012640	So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according
2012640	2017040	to this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight.
2017040	2021400	Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.
2021400	2026560	For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary
2026560	2031600	twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.
2031600	2034920	I mean to be fair, before I washed my asshole I was a quarterback.
2034920	2035920	Now I'm a cheerleader.
2035920	2039800	D-I-C-T-R-O-Y don't tell the coach I was a guy.
2039800	2044440	This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me
2044440	2048880	of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.
2048880	2053240	Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must
2053240	2057880	be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck
2057880	2061680	and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws.
2061680	2067640	I think this hyper-masculine hetero-man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of
2067640	2072520	kosher law governing straightness, and the is-this-gay game is its theology.
2072520	2077200	Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all
2077200	2079280	people, Count Dankula.
2079280	2084640	If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're
2084640	2087480	touching a dick, and that's gay.
2087480	2090320	Well memed my lord, well memed.
2090320	2094640	The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when Dankula concludes that since
2094640	2100280	a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore
2100280	2103840	having sex with a woman is pretty gay.
2103840	2108920	Obviously this is shitposting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps
2108920	2110840	are gay because chromosomes.
2110840	2115160	So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.
2115160	2117320	So what is being gay?
2117320	2118320	Socrates.
2118560	2122200	Mm, on second thought, I don't know her.
2122200	2123200	9.
2123200	2125800	Being gay is good, actually.
2125800	2129000	Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's
2129000	2132560	good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the
2132560	2133560	first place?
2133560	2136800	Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?
2136800	2141680	It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with
2141680	2145400	manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs.
2145480	2149240	Now men, this might be difficult to hear, and maybe you don't want to hear it from
2149240	2154360	me, but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting
2154360	2156840	trans women, and it's hurting gay people.
2156840	2159680	For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.
2159680	2163560	Who wants to sleep with a guy who's so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't
2163560	2165560	even enjoy his own body?
2165560	2168360	Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.
2168360	2170800	Being pegged does not make you gay.
2170800	2175240	Sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay.
2175240	2176240	And why?
2176240	2181520	Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is
2181520	2184720	persistently attracted to people of the same gender.
2184720	2188560	If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender and you identify with the
2188560	2190800	word gay, then you're gay.
2190800	2194520	If not, then you're not, and nothing you can do will change that.
2194520	2198800	So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is
2198800	2199800	good actually.
2199800	2203440	I mean why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?
2203440	2208080	Now, I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense.
2208080	2209080	We the gays.
2209080	2215240	But as a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight
2215240	2219200	men are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.
2219200	2223760	But that is not a wound I'm going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me
2223760	2227840	to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.
2227840	2228840	Are traps gay?
2228840	2230720	Baby, who cares?
2230720	2232160	Just do what feels good.
2232480	2235920	That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say,
2235920	2238320	traps are gay but there's nothing wrong with being gay,
2238320	2243640	that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men and to reinforce the stigma
2243640	2248880	against dating us among the group of people who are in fact most attracted to us.
2248880	2252880	Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.
2252880	2257360	And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted
2257360	2259960	to us are willing to openly date us.
2259960	2262000	And the stigma is very real.
2262000	2267040	A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.
2267040	2271800	Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they
2271800	2277160	experience, in short, a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.
2277160	2282720	But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices
2282720	2283960	control his life.
2283960	2289880	A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.
2289880	2295960	A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.
2295960	2303400	And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a
2303400	2305320	man than you.
2314280	2317240	10. I have feelings too.
2317320	2323880	Well, I guess today we learned that rTrapsGay is not a debate worth winning, because just
2323880	2329880	by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the bigoted assumptions
2329880	2331160	it relies on.
2331160	2335600	Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is
2335600	2336600	deserved.
2336600	2337800	Hashtag not all gamers.
2337800	2344280	But also, this video completely centers men's feelings, and I have feelings too goddammit.
2344280	2349320	And some of those feelings are not all that different from the anxieties men have.
2349320	2352000	Let me explain.
2352000	2353000	Let me explain.
2353000	2357960	So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology
2357960	2359880	for confused slutbag.
2359880	2365560	Before I transitioned I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbonical feelings,
2365560	2370360	but early on in my transition I encountered a lot of TERF shit, and it really scared me
2370360	2372680	off dating cis lesbians, which I never have.
2372920	2376760	Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back
2376760	2378680	of my head for a long time.
2378680	2381960	But about a year ago I was like, I want to fuck men.
2381960	2384040	I want to fuck men.
2384040	2388280	But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.
2388280	2393320	Because men are scary, and in my early transition I'd only dated bisexual trans people in enbies,
2393320	2396760	and as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.
2396760	2400040	A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.
2400040	2403640	If that teaches you something about gender, it might be hard to learn otherwise.
2403640	2409880	And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real
2409880	2415400	woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as the radiant model
2415400	2419320	of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.
2419320	2424360	And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing out.
2424360	2428160	But what I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group
2428160	2432160	of people to date when you're early in transition, because they're pretty chill about anatomy
2432160	2433160	and presentation.
2433160	2436960	But if you're going to date cis-het men, you need to be serving women.
2436960	2439800	And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt.
2439800	2442000	And I did wonder if I was woman enough for it.
2442000	2446000	So the first couple times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off is
2446000	2448280	he going to think I'm a man?
2448280	2450720	Basically my anxiety was are traps gay?
2450720	2453440	But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually.
2453440	2455920	And of course, you start by sucking dick.
2455920	2461200	That's very safe, because like, what red-blooded man is going to turn down a t-girl blowjob?
2461200	2463400	And it doesn't involve my junk in any way.
2463400	2467720	Then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned
2467720	2472560	we'd been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between
2472560	2476240	a man and a woman, like, that shit is super hot.
2476240	2480720	Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on me,
2480720	2485280	and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man, what if he's
2485280	2486280	repulsed?
2486280	2489440	Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?
2489440	2491320	The answer is yes.
2491320	2493640	It was so hot.
2493640	2498360	I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would
2498360	2503320	just say it's special, 10 out of 10.
2503320	2504800	And you know what he told me after?
2504800	2508760	He told me he liked the mouth feel.
2508760	2511320	Everyone's talking about it now, bitches!
2511360	2516520	So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,
2516520	2521400	because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction, but I do want to shame men for
2521400	2526520	treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets, and I do want to shame men for dehumanizing
2526520	2531000	us and voting away our rights by day while jerking off to shemale porn by night, and
2531000	2535480	I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong enough
2535480	2540320	to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every
2540320	2545280	moment of every day, and I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends
2545280	2549560	because they couldn't stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.
2549560	2551160	That is pathetic.
2551160	2555520	If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up
2555520	2558820	for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards?
2558820	2561960	So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.
2561960	2563800	Don't call human beings traps.
2563800	2566800	If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.
2566800	2568640	It's okay, you can date us.
2568640	2570600	We're more than just jack-off material.
2570600	2574200	If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.
2574200	2578040	If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because god knows she's been through
2578040	2579040	enough shit.
2579040	2583640	And finally, protect trans women of color at all costs.
2583640	2586280	All I want here is basic human decency.
2586280	2588920	Is that really too much to ask?
2588920	2594840	Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.
2594840	2596840	God damn it.
2603160	2606720	Well, that was long.
2606720	2614240	I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful
2614240	2616240	woman's penis.
2625440	2634440	You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware
2634440	2640440	of how crude, heard before, bigoted and plain rude.
2640440	2643840	All the things that you say come up every day.
2643840	2650840	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.
2650840	2658840	It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who find us.
2672840	2679840	There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.
2679840	2686840	It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who find us.
2687840	2690840	Don't let them define us.
