00:00.000 --> 00:19.640
Hello my devilish darlings, it is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here

00:19.640 --> 00:24.600
to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.920
There will be discussion of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
Ugh.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.360
So if that's going to make you sad, please don't watch this.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.720
Unless you enjoy sadness, I know I do.

00:37.720 --> 00:42.880
But your macabre mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made you a wet

00:42.880 --> 00:48.520
pot of hot tea, and you can take it out on the balcony and pour it on some pedestrians.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.320
That always cheers me up!

00:51.320 --> 00:54.080
1.

00:54.080 --> 01:00.120
Traps Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to

01:00.120 --> 01:04.920
submit to you the findings of my latest memetic research.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.080
Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing

01:10.080 --> 01:16.960
volumes ancient and modern, in search of the answer to two fundamental questions.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.480
What are traps, and be they gay?

01:21.480 --> 01:27.240
With respect to the former inquiry, I adduce for your consideration a treatise by the lady

01:27.240 --> 01:33.400
scholar known as the pedantic Romantic, wherein the derivation of the word trap is traced

01:33.400 --> 01:36.920
to patrons of animated pictures from the Orient.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.920
Curious.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.160
The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture

01:43.160 --> 01:48.680
forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral

01:48.680 --> 01:53.840
Ackbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.

01:53.840 --> 02:00.080
Contemporaneous to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic japonesques,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.920
to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.880
The implication being that the subject of the portrait was not in soothe a daughter

02:08.880 --> 02:15.160
of Eve, but rather that the spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
skullduggery.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.480
Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only

02:22.480 --> 02:25.800
transvestites, but transsexuals as well.

02:25.800 --> 02:31.760
And this must needs be remarked, for tis evident such persons oft times inflame the lust of

02:31.760 --> 02:33.000
ordinary men.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.280
It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus, fellas, is

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
it gay?

02:40.280 --> 02:44.000
I'm sorry, who are you talking to?

02:44.040 --> 02:49.480
Gentlemen of the Academy, did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again?

02:49.480 --> 02:53.160
It must needs be remarked.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.800
Please stop breaking into my house.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.880
I shall be the Queen of Dairy.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.400
I'm sure you will be.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.040
Cross-dresser.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.600
Hi, I'm Natalie Wynn, biological woman.

03:07.600 --> 03:13.000
Can we pan the camera down, my hair is less high.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.280
Are traps gay?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.160
The meme, that will not die.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.040
Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male cross-dresser

03:24.040 --> 03:28.640
or a trans woman, especially in a context of neotenous kawaii decadence.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.560
The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate about the sexuality of men attracted

03:33.560 --> 03:36.280
to dick girls, food nari, mtfs.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.640
You know, a lot of these men don't know or care about the difference between a trans

03:39.640 --> 03:43.600
woman and a cross-dresser, so it's kind of pointless to get hung up on that.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.520
The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago, when someone released the worst specimens

03:47.520 --> 03:49.920
of the white race into the wild.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.480
Are traps gay?

03:51.480 --> 03:53.400
One of life's most important questions.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.360
Are traps gay?

03:55.360 --> 03:59.760
Traps are gay, uh, you know, uh, yes.

03:59.760 --> 04:06.000
Will there be transsexuals in the ethnic state, uh, uh, hopefully not.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
To the men who meme about this topic, it's all lighthearted fun.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.240
It's part of a wider game they like to play called Is It Gay, you know, is it gay to have

04:13.240 --> 04:16.280
an mmf threesome only if the balls touch?

04:16.280 --> 04:17.560
Don't cross the streams.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
And so on.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.600
But to many trans women, the meme and the word trap itself are highly offensive.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.280
In fact, last year when I first proposed making a video about this topic, many trans people

04:27.280 --> 04:31.480
on Twitter were outraged because they felt that this topic is just too harmful to even

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
discuss.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.640
So here's the challenge I face making this video.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.640
On the one hand, there's people who are going to be upset and offended that I'm making a

04:37.640 --> 04:41.400
video about this topic at all, and on the other hand, there are people who think this

04:41.400 --> 04:45.320
is all just harmless otaku shitposting and who are going to be annoyed by my trigger

04:45.320 --> 04:46.320
warnings.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.720
But first, to the people who think it's too offensive, here's what I have to say for myself.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.480
I've always believed that if you want to persuade anyone, it helps to meet them where they're

04:53.480 --> 04:54.480
at.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.440
And in this case, rtrapsgay is where people are at.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.040
At one of my YouTube meetups I met a high school teacher who told me that he overheard

05:01.040 --> 05:04.800
some of his male students joking in the hallway about rtrapsgay.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.000
When those teenage boys go home and google rtrapsgay, who do you want to explain it to

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
them?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.560
This is our Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy, a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula,

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
or this tran.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.280
And at the risk of sounding arrogant, I think it should be me.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.200
You know, as trans women, we have little influence in society.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.840
The people who lead the conversations about us are bigger and stronger than we are, so

05:26.840 --> 05:29.280
we're like a jogger racing against a car.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.040
The only way to win is to hijack the car.

05:32.040 --> 05:37.560
And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation that straight men are having

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
about us.

05:38.680 --> 05:44.000
As always, my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion from edgy premises, to shitpost

05:44.000 --> 05:45.840
my way to the moral high ground.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.680
Now, straight men, isn't all this offense-taking just more politically correct cuckoldry designed

05:50.680 --> 05:52.240
to take away your free speech?

05:52.240 --> 05:56.320
Well, I assure you there will be no taking of your free speech on this channel.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.600
Unless you clock my makeup, dickbag!

05:58.600 --> 05:59.880
Comment deleted!

05:59.880 --> 06:05.320
But, if you want to know why trans women are offended by rtrapsgay, I'm happy to tell you.

06:05.320 --> 06:10.120
Not to silence you, of course, but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity to

06:10.120 --> 06:15.000
want to know why someone different from you might be hurt by something that seems harmless

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
to you.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.560
So, well, let's put it this way.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.960
2.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.040
Trans Panic

06:23.040 --> 06:28.160
The 1990 documentary Paris is Burning depicts the ball culture of Black and Latinx gay and

06:28.160 --> 06:31.600
transgender people in New York City in the late 1980s.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.160
One of the main storylines follows a trans woman named Venus Extravaganza, who describes

06:36.160 --> 06:38.520
her precarious existence as a sex worker.

06:38.520 --> 06:44.280
I was with a guy and he was playing with my titties until he touched me down there.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.480
He felt it and he seen it and he like totally flipped out.

06:47.480 --> 06:52.360
He said, you fucking faggot, you're a freak, you're a victim of AIDS and you're trying

06:52.360 --> 06:53.360
to give me AIDS?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.360
What are you, crazy?

06:54.360 --> 06:55.360
You're a homo.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.360
I should kill you.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.720
I was really terrified, so I just jumped out the window.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.400
During the filming of Paris is Burning, Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.600
Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.

07:09.600 --> 07:14.240
Trans women, in my country almost entirely trans women of color, are murdered at a disgracefully

07:14.240 --> 07:17.960
high rate, reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.200
The men who murder trans women often claim they were provoked to violence by the alleged

07:22.200 --> 07:24.040
deception of their victims.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.600
This is what's called the trans panic defense when legally invoked, as in the 2004 trial

07:29.600 --> 07:33.040
of the killers of the teenage trans girl Gwen Araujo.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.480
One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen before learning she was trans, cried,

07:36.480 --> 07:40.080
I can't be fucking gay, before beating her to death.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.280
Men are often willing to side with these killers, saying that if trans women don't want to get

07:44.280 --> 07:46.360
murdered, then they shouldn't trick men.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.960
But what you have to understand is, first, men usually do know when they're having sex

07:50.960 --> 07:51.960
with a trans woman.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.200
Like, if you have a dick, it's pretty hard, actually, to have sex with someone and have

07:56.200 --> 07:57.640
them not notice it.

07:57.640 --> 08:03.200
And second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence as itself a kind of trickery.

08:03.200 --> 08:07.800
A black trans woman named Ilan Nettles was murdered in Harlem in 2013 by a man whose

08:07.800 --> 08:10.360
friends had mocked him for flirting with her.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.680
All she did to provoke him was walk down the street with two friends.

08:14.680 --> 08:19.240
The common thread here is not deception on the part of the victims, but rather the drive

08:19.240 --> 08:23.720
of the killers to protect their social standing as masculine and straight.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.520
But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure is something that many trans women across

08:28.520 --> 08:31.400
class and race experience some version of.

08:31.400 --> 08:38.440
Because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement, as the orchidaceous invitation

08:38.440 --> 08:39.880
to a proboscis.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.960
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman who was attacked recently by a man at

08:43.960 --> 08:48.440
a bar who started flirting with her until he realized she was trans and then punched

08:48.440 --> 08:49.440
her.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.440
Like what was she supposed to do to stop that from happening, just stay at home?

08:52.440 --> 08:57.160
For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us for existing actually limit our

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
freedom.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.400
There's bars I won't go into, because I don't trust the clientele to side with me if some

09:02.400 --> 09:03.880
shit like that goes down.

09:03.880 --> 09:08.240
And I've had little scares, I was in the back of an Uber once and the driver comes on a

09:08.240 --> 09:11.640
little flirty, you know, what's your name, are you a student?

09:11.640 --> 09:15.480
And I'm thinking wow, he thinks I'm young enough to be a student!

09:15.520 --> 09:20.600
But at some point he goes silent, and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare in the rearview

09:20.600 --> 09:25.680
mirror, like fucking clocked, and for a second I'm like fuck, I'm gonna die in the back of

09:25.680 --> 09:26.800
this car.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.120
And of course I didn't die, the rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine.

09:31.120 --> 09:36.240
I mean I'm gonna be fine, because white middle-class transsexuals don't get murdered in this country.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.760
The murder issue exists at a specific intersection of gender, class, and race, and it's really

09:40.760 --> 09:42.560
not my oppression to claim.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.200
You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle-class, computer programmer trans women

09:46.200 --> 09:50.040
be like, we're getting murdered in the streets, who's we?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.120
It's not white, middle-class trans women.

09:52.120 --> 09:56.640
So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane, it exists at this intersection

09:56.640 --> 10:00.640
of masculinity and race, and that's really not a conversation that should be led by a

10:00.640 --> 10:07.440
white woman, especially when there's so, so, so many things to critique about white masculinity.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.640
Let's talk about some now.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.640
3.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.640
Taking Offense

10:11.720 --> 10:14.000
Okay, back to traps.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.400
Now this is my lane.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.800
I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.480
Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being entitled to the soapbox.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.640
So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom is abridged by our need to navigate

10:27.640 --> 10:33.440
around men who view our gender presentation, in fact our very existence, as a kind of trap.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.760
I think it should therefore be pretty clear why trans women are not the biggest fans of

10:37.760 --> 10:41.240
you using that word for us, or for foodinari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.

10:41.240 --> 10:47.160
I mean to be honest, if someone calls me a trap, my response is more like, wow, a transphobe

10:47.160 --> 10:48.480
thought I looked like a woman.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.320
But that's because I'm so pathetic I have to go dumpster diving for validation, but

10:52.320 --> 10:56.480
the rest of the trans women out there, the ones with dignity and self-respect, you should

10:56.480 --> 10:58.320
definitely not call them traps.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.760
Of course, some trans women will overstate the case and say the word trap is literally

11:01.760 --> 11:06.680
getting trans women killed, which, I can't find any examples of the word trap being connected

11:06.680 --> 11:11.680
to a murder, but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies, hmm?

11:11.680 --> 11:15.280
Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps is you're showing that you think

11:15.280 --> 11:19.200
of us the exact same way as the men who try to justify attacking us.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.360
When a man kills a trans woman, literally the argument he trots out in court is that

11:23.360 --> 11:24.640
he was trapped.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.120
And that's what you're reminding us of when you use that word, and that's why trans women

11:29.120 --> 11:30.360
are getting triggered over it.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.360
You know, sometimes people have good reasons for being triggered by things, and this is

11:34.360 --> 11:35.720
one of those times.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.720
So, if I were a different kind of creator, I could really end this video now.

11:39.720 --> 11:43.880
I think I've made a pretty convincing case that trans women are justifiably offended

11:43.880 --> 11:45.160
by the word trap.

11:45.160 --> 11:50.200
But, if I leave it at that, and this is for you Twitter, this is why I'm making this video,

11:50.200 --> 11:54.600
if I simply argue that rTrapsK is offensive, then here's what happens.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.080
First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.760
In fact, me telling them it's offensive only makes them want to say it more, because they

12:00.760 --> 12:05.960
feel on a deep level that they are by nature superior to trans people, so an uppity tranny

12:05.960 --> 12:09.400
telling them what words they're allowed to say completely enrages them.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.800
So they'll comment, traps are gay, lol, just to reaffirm their superiority over me and

12:13.800 --> 12:17.680
that I have no power or influence over them, and there's really nothing I can do about

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
those people.

12:18.680 --> 12:24.560
But, another group of people, the socially progressive liberals, they'll say, okay,

12:24.560 --> 12:28.160
so since you're offended by it, I won't say the word trap anymore, and they'll be super

12:28.160 --> 12:32.400
woke about it, and they'll post Twitter callouts canceling anyone who uses the word trap, and

12:32.400 --> 12:37.440
they'll be very respectful and compassionate toward trans people in public, so long as

12:37.440 --> 12:42.960
it makes them look good to indulge and pity this tragic third world country of a gender minority.

12:42.960 --> 12:48.160
But then, they'll go home at night, and in that twilight between consciousness and sleep,

12:48.160 --> 12:52.080
their inner voice will whisper, but rTrapsK.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.720
And then, years later, when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend, we'll suddenly

12:56.720 --> 13:01.400
watch all that shallow wokeness vanish like so much politically correct vapor.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.280
Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.

13:05.280 --> 13:12.320
So it's not enough for me to argue that rTrapsGay is offensive, I also have to argue…

13:12.320 --> 13:15.080
whether traps are gay.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.360
So… rTrapsGay?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.400
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

13:20.960 --> 13:35.400
🎵

13:35.400 --> 13:39.400
4. The Philosopher

13:39.400 --> 13:44.120
Hello boys, it is I, the half-queen, points.

13:44.120 --> 13:49.160
After thirty days and thirty nights, the Philosopher descended from the mountaintop into the gathered

13:49.200 --> 13:51.080
villagers, thus spake.

13:51.080 --> 13:56.040
R. Traps. Gay, said he, to whom the half-queen thus replied.

13:56.040 --> 14:00.640
Hmm, let's see, let me think about it, oh.

14:00.640 --> 14:06.320
I'm gonna stop saying trap now, because it's not a good word, as has been explained,

14:06.320 --> 14:08.560
in fact it's really best to read it like a slur.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.040
So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to or has sex with a trans

14:13.040 --> 14:14.760
woman, is that gay?

14:14.760 --> 14:19.800
Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are women, and a man having sex with

14:19.800 --> 14:26.040
a woman is, um, let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted, it is not

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
in fact gay.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.760
But that's not the most persuasive answer, because in order to find it convincing, you

14:30.760 --> 14:33.640
already have to believe that trans women are women.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.560
And unfortunately if you ask the average person about this, what they say is something like

14:37.920 --> 14:44.720
Sure, I think trans women are women, but they shouldn't expect men to want to date them

14:44.720 --> 14:47.400
unless they're into that sort of thing.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
Oh?

14:48.400 --> 14:52.000
And what sort of thing is that?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.320
Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman and you say oh what's she like and

14:55.320 --> 15:01.760
he says she's from Cincinnati, your response is not, oh David, I didn't realize you

15:01.760 --> 15:04.480
were into that sort of thing.

15:04.480 --> 15:09.720
In other words, these people tell you trans women are women, but, and then they say something

15:09.720 --> 15:13.600
that shows they don't really think trans women are women at all.

15:13.600 --> 15:18.880
So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point, it would basically be circular

15:18.880 --> 15:23.680
reasoning for me to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay because trans women

15:23.680 --> 15:28.960
are women, since the womanhood of trans women is precisely the point that's being disputed.

15:28.960 --> 15:34.120
So maybe the observational approach is better, the facts are indisputable, many heterosexual

15:34.120 --> 15:37.800
men are attracted to trans women, and comparatively few gay men are.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.160
Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact about our everyday experience in the

15:42.160 --> 15:43.160
world.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.320
We know who's attracted to us and who isn't, so to us this completely unnecessary debate

15:48.320 --> 15:52.400
is as impractical as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.320
Sure, philosophers can say, but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow, to which

15:57.320 --> 16:02.240
the correct response is shut the fuck up nerd, stop playing 3D chess against your own brain,

16:02.240 --> 16:03.720
and find a real thing to worry about.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.600
It's just a basic fact of experience that the sun rises every morning, and to trans

16:07.600 --> 16:12.080
women it's a basic fact of experience that the people who are attracted to us are people

16:12.080 --> 16:13.960
who are attracted to women.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.480
Of the cis men I've been with since I started my transition, all identify as straight and

16:18.480 --> 16:22.320
all had only ever been with cis women until this tran came along.

16:22.320 --> 16:26.900
Am I really so powerful a seductress that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay over

16:26.900 --> 16:28.120
these tiny tits?

16:28.120 --> 16:31.480
Let's not get cocky.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.800
I mean if a man is attracted to women and not to men, and he perceives me as a woman

16:35.800 --> 16:40.040
and is attracted to me as a woman, and he sleeps with me, and then he continues being

16:40.040 --> 16:44.760
attracted to women and not to men, in what world is that anything but a straight man?

16:44.760 --> 16:49.000
What wild maze of reasoning do you have to invent to argue that this man is really gay?

16:49.000 --> 16:53.200
Well we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes, beginning with the obvious.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.920
What about the penis?

16:54.920 --> 16:57.600
Ah yes, the penis.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.080
Look baby we'll get to the penis, don't you worry about that.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.320
But first I should remind everyone that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas,

17:05.320 --> 17:06.320
because they got five.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.320
In fact I've been thinking of signing up for a vagina myself, but the thing is I make too

17:14.320 --> 17:19.440
much money for Medicaid now so I have to form an LLC, become my own employer so I can give

17:19.440 --> 17:22.240
myself health benefits, and ugh it's so much paperwork.

17:22.240 --> 17:26.000
You have to become an unincorporated legal entity in this country just to get a fucking

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
cunt.

17:27.040 --> 17:31.120
Because transphobic radical feminists will say it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,

17:31.120 --> 17:33.640
because a real vagina is a sacred passage.

17:33.640 --> 17:37.840
And that's fine by me, what am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway, get fingered

17:37.840 --> 17:38.840
by the Pope?

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
Pass.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.560
Straight men don't get hung up on this, I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought

17:43.560 --> 17:47.800
of a vagina as a sacred passage, they're either grossed out by it or they're trying to climb

17:47.800 --> 17:48.800
inside.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.360
What I'm trying to say is, in the past I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina

17:52.360 --> 17:57.040
because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad and besides, chicks with dicks are very in

17:57.040 --> 18:01.760
right now, very 2019, very trending, and being a dick girl it's kind of like being a legendary

18:01.760 --> 18:03.200
Pokemon, you know?

18:03.200 --> 18:07.040
People take interest, people pay attention to you, and isn't that what we all want?

18:07.040 --> 18:12.240
But unfashionable though it is, I do think I want the surgery because, well, guys can

18:12.240 --> 18:14.240
I confess something kind of dark to you?

18:14.240 --> 18:21.160
I have this really fucked up fetish where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.160
Crazy right?

18:22.160 --> 18:25.520
I mean I like anal, but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.520
Ew.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.560
I don't want to eat well, I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked,

18:29.560 --> 18:30.560
is that a crime?

18:30.560 --> 18:33.280
It is kind of a scary surgery though, like what if my vagina sucks?

18:33.280 --> 18:37.920
I'm afraid I have some bad news, the tests are back and are showing that, in the medical

18:37.920 --> 18:41.480
terminology, your vagina does indeed suck.

18:41.480 --> 18:45.360
The point is, the easy sell version of the argument I'm making is that there's nothing

18:45.360 --> 18:49.960
homosexual about a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years,

18:49.960 --> 18:55.280
she has female skin, she smells like a woman, she has breasts, she's giving hair body face,

18:55.280 --> 18:57.040
she's post-op and has a vagina.

18:57.040 --> 19:01.080
Now even in this situation, people will still say it's gay because of the chromosomes.

19:01.080 --> 19:06.080
But look, human beings have five senses, and none of them can detect chromosomes.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.520
Sexual attraction is not based on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender, it's based on perception.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.720
And if you're a man, and you perceive someone as a woman, and you're attracted to her as

19:14.720 --> 19:18.120
a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment my dude.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.720
Congratulations, you're a breeder.

19:19.720 --> 19:24.920
Now the argument people make is, okay fine, it's straight if you mistake her for a biological

19:24.920 --> 19:30.600
woman, but if you know she's a man and you're still attracted, then it's gaaaaaaaaaaay.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.640
So look, if you believe that trans women are men, then that belief might interfere with

19:34.640 --> 19:38.360
your perceptions, and it might change the relationship between your perceptions and

19:38.360 --> 19:39.800
your sexual response.

19:39.800 --> 19:44.360
But more likely is that you still will feel attraction to the trans woman, only if you

19:44.360 --> 19:48.760
value your identity as a straight man, you'll feel ashamed of your attraction, and you'll

19:48.760 --> 19:52.640
try to fight and deny it, and you'll probably end up treating trans women like absolute

19:52.640 --> 19:53.640
garbage.

19:53.640 --> 19:58.000
Now if I wanted to make the SJW one-on-one type response here, I would say trans women

19:58.000 --> 20:00.960
are women because they identify as women.

20:00.960 --> 20:06.000
And so, every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction to a trans woman is necessarily

20:06.000 --> 20:11.560
experiencing heterosexual attraction, because of the way the person he's attracted to identifies.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.840
But that's just replacing the black and white thinking of a biology dogma with the

20:15.840 --> 20:18.240
black and white thinking of an identity dogma.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.360
But human sexuality is not black and white, it's not even shades of grey, it's a multi-color

20:23.360 --> 20:27.680
acid trip, it's centaur Donna Summer charging at you with a spanking paddle.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.520
So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes, but it's not usually based on psychological

20:32.520 --> 20:33.920
identity either.

20:33.920 --> 20:38.400
Most of the time, initial attraction anyway is based on what I'd call presentation, how

20:38.400 --> 20:39.400
you look and act.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.080
And I think that's especially true of men, they get turned on by that initial visual

20:43.080 --> 20:44.080
pop.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.720
They see, they conquer, they cum.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.080
I mean you have to admire the simplicity of it.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.280
Sometimes I wish I were a man.

20:50.280 --> 20:55.240
So look, if what you want is a woman who pops, then rest assured there are plenty of trans

20:55.240 --> 20:56.400
women who pop.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.200
Maybe you don't think I pop, but you'd be hard-pressed to argue that any number of trans

21:00.200 --> 21:03.880
models and actresses don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.960
So the pop is undeniable, no one's questioning the pop.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.000
In fact, without the pop, it never would've occurred to men to call trans women traps,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.720
because they wouldn't be trapped if they weren't attracted in the first place.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.120
But a lot of men seem to think that the pop, the visual presentation of a trans woman,

21:19.120 --> 21:23.600
is some kind of illusion or facade that at some point will be dropped, revealing that

21:23.600 --> 21:26.240
our womanhood is a sham and that we're really men.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.100
Now here's a big difference between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.

21:30.100 --> 21:34.240
If you date a cis drag queen, at some point, you're getting a manhoney.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.160
As explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.640
I don't want to date nobody who want to date me like this, because this comes off.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.720
And you're not doing nothing with this.

21:43.720 --> 21:48.120
But if you date me, there's no de-dragging, there's no moment where I become a man.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.520
Baby, what you see is what you got.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.200
At least on this side, this is my natural side.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.520
And this is my biological side.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.520
When we're discussing people who are trans, we immediately say in the first paragraph

21:58.520 --> 22:01.520
trans woman, and then we're personified by their biological pronoun, because biology

22:01.520 --> 22:04.120
is the nature of the pronoun, so.

22:04.120 --> 22:08.040
Everyone's always hating on trans women for being stereotypically feminine, so why

22:08.040 --> 22:10.840
do you think that in the bedroom we'd be any other way?

22:10.840 --> 22:14.400
Part of it is that people are really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy and what

22:14.400 --> 22:15.680
it does for trans women.

22:15.680 --> 22:20.560
It feminizes our skin, our smell, our body fat distribution, it makes us grow breasts.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.640
That's right, these are my very real, very biological titties.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.960
I mean I'm wearing a push-up bra, but at least there's something to push up now.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.160
Here, I'll show you.

22:29.160 --> 22:34.800
I mean they're small, but it's not by any measure a male chest, and what I have

22:34.800 --> 22:38.840
is very real, very biological, and very female.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.760
You people think everything to do with trans women is fake.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.000
Fake voice, fake boobs, fake hair.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.120
But that's prejudice more than observation.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.080
Like I've noticed that whether or not I actually wear a wig in a video has exactly

22:50.080 --> 22:54.000
zero effect on how many people comment to call me a man in a wig.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
So I may as well just wear wigs.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.720
And I may as well get my boobs done too, since people are gonna call them fake either way.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.680
But for what it's worth, this is my real hair, at least on this half, and these are

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
my real boobs.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.200
And if I bring home a gentleman, or a lady, all that stays on in bed, and it's there

23:08.200 --> 23:09.520
when I wake up in the morning.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.280
But what about the penis?

23:11.280 --> 23:13.200
Alright, alright, look.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.600
If the penis is feminine, how is that gay?

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
I rest my case.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.600
Roll credits.

23:17.600 --> 23:22.720
You can't make me you.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
6.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.200
The Feminine Penis.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.960
Look, some guys want the Ts and the D.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
And that's the T.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.040
Now a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick, even a lady dick, makes any sexual

23:34.040 --> 23:35.920
interaction with a man gay.

23:35.920 --> 23:42.960
But isn't male homosexuality usually understood as attraction to men, and not merely to penises

23:42.960 --> 23:44.360
wherever they may arise?

23:44.360 --> 23:49.320
I think there probably are some gay men who really just like dick.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.000
And I'm not judging, I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.960
But being a straight man, I don't really think that's best understood as a man attracted

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
to vaginas.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.640
You call women pussy, but then you're always like ew, period, I'm a straight man, I'm

24:02.640 --> 24:06.200
not used to putting a towel down when I fuck, I don't know how to use a condom because

24:06.200 --> 24:09.520
I expect cis women to be on birth control and do everything for me.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.920
And then you have straight incels online calling labia roast beef and generally putting on

24:13.920 --> 24:15.680
a show of vaginal disgust.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.440
I mean if you're gonna date cis women or post-op trans women, I think you owe it to

24:19.440 --> 24:21.840
them to be a little more vagina positive.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
Cause even though straight men are like ew dicks, that's gay.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.000
You guys also kinda love dicks?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.280
You're always drawing them?

24:28.280 --> 24:29.960
Your buildings look like dicks?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.640
Your porn all has dicks in it?

24:31.640 --> 24:33.240
So what about dicks on chicks?

24:33.240 --> 24:37.280
Well men like chicks and men like dicks, so what's the problem officer?

24:37.280 --> 24:40.600
I think the booming popularity of t-girl porn speaks for itself.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.960
On Pornhub, the shemale category contains more videos than other such popular categories

24:45.960 --> 24:50.960
as rough sex, orgy, and webcam, and it's mostly straight men who watch it.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.640
When AdultEmpire.com moved their t-girl content from their gay site to their straight site,

24:55.640 --> 24:56.640
views increased 50%.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.920
In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom

25:01.920 --> 25:07.240
bill, the adult site GameLink's top-selling titles in North Carolina were My Transsexual

25:07.240 --> 25:12.720
Teacher, Shemale Shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Transvisions 6.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.400
A lot of straight men first find out about trans women through porn, which isn't great

25:17.480 --> 25:23.360
since most t-girl porn is not trans-positive and uses dehumanizing slurs like shemale and

25:23.360 --> 25:26.760
tranny, which is how you end up living in a country full of people who will jerk off

25:26.760 --> 25:29.040
to you but won't give you rights.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.120
So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.360
Shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
Great!

25:35.360 --> 25:36.360
I love that for us.

25:36.360 --> 25:40.560
Now there probably are some men who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick,

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
and you know what?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.560
That's fine.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.720
Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
You like what you like.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.600
I'm not here to police anyone's desires.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.000
In fact, quite the opposite.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.240
I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste from society's cruel and unjust prejudice

25:56.240 --> 25:58.120
against their t-girl-loving ways.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.520
But liberation begins with understanding.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.880
So who are the men who love trans girls?

26:02.880 --> 26:06.880
Well, according to trans women I've talked to and my own personal experience, the men

26:06.880 --> 26:10.080
who date us can be divided into three general groups.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.320
Group 1 are men who, to be honest, are actually kinda put off by the dick, but they're so

26:15.360 --> 26:19.680
attracted to the woman it's attached to that they're willing to work around it, or wait

26:19.680 --> 26:22.200
for it to grow on them.

26:22.200 --> 26:27.520
Group 2 are men who are attracted to trans women including their penises, but they don't

26:27.520 --> 26:32.280
specifically fetishize the penis, so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover had genital

26:32.280 --> 26:33.880
reassignment and got a vagina.

26:33.880 --> 26:38.720
And then group 3 are men who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks, and often want

26:38.720 --> 26:41.160
to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.520
Now group 3 are what the trans community calls chasers.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.200
I think chasers is generally a bad idea because their attraction to us is based around fetishizing

26:49.200 --> 26:53.300
our genitals, which is often the part of us that we're most uncomfortable with.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.480
So if you're a t-girl who likes men, group 2 is really Goldilocks perfection unless you

26:57.480 --> 27:00.280
really like topping or you've had the surgery.

27:00.280 --> 27:04.080
Now I should say that group 2 does include some bisexual men, and bisexual people of

27:04.080 --> 27:06.720
either gender can be great partners if you're trans.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.920
You like girls, you like dick, I'm a girl with a dick, let's make this happen.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.520
That said, if someone views that part of me as male, and wants me to do with it what

27:14.520 --> 27:16.600
men do with it, then pass.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.600
Not interested.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.480
Now, you might be wondering, what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?

27:22.480 --> 27:24.520
How could I view it as anything other than a male part?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.080
It's a fucking penis!

27:26.080 --> 27:27.440
Well I'm glad you asked.

27:27.440 --> 27:33.000
I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.960
You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.680
Context, usage, and physiology.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.440
So first, context.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.040
Picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
Now, picture her with a penis.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.960
That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.800
It's feminine because of the context that it's in.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.320
Second, usage.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.520
A lesson in penis etiquette.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.960
A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.

27:57.960 --> 28:02.320
He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug, he may penetrate, he may order you to get

28:02.320 --> 28:06.440
on your knees like a good girl and f***.

28:06.440 --> 28:13.840
Whereas, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a lady of good breeding never brandishes

28:13.840 --> 28:14.840
her penis.

28:14.840 --> 28:19.840
When she rises from the bath, she covers it gracefully with a demure hand, and when not

28:19.840 --> 28:22.760
in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.

28:22.760 --> 28:26.280
Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.

28:26.280 --> 28:30.880
The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.760
This doesn't make things any easier, but it does build character.

28:34.760 --> 28:40.720
Next, you wanna take not one, but two pairs of cotton-lined, poly-spandex, bikini-cut

28:40.720 --> 28:46.080
panties, at least one size too small, and pull them most of the way up your legs.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.920
Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.

28:49.920 --> 28:54.520
You're gonna take your claw, and you're gonna grab your scrotum, and you're gonna yank that

28:54.520 --> 28:56.440
bubblegum back into your peach crease.

28:56.440 --> 29:01.280
Now hold it back with one hand, and with your other hand, push your penis back, pressing

29:01.280 --> 29:03.960
those little eggs up into your pelvis.

29:03.960 --> 29:08.240
Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place, and then pull your panties up, front

29:08.240 --> 29:13.480
first, then back, run your hand over it to make sure nothing's seeping out the sides,

29:13.480 --> 29:15.160
and then voila.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.880
It's like it was never there.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.040
For more information, you can purchase my book, Tuck Your Penis, with a new foreword

29:21.040 --> 29:22.880
by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

29:22.880 --> 29:27.440
I've now explained both the context and the usage of the feminine penis, so let us now

29:27.440 --> 29:29.140
turn to physiology.

29:29.140 --> 29:33.360
Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones actually changes the anatomy and

29:33.360 --> 29:38.320
functionality of the genitals, shrinking everything down and softening everything up.

29:38.320 --> 29:43.280
That means changes to a little thing not a lot of people are talking about, but something

29:43.280 --> 29:48.200
I've been trying to raise awareness of, you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,

29:48.200 --> 29:53.200
really get people talking about 7, the mouthfeel.

29:53.200 --> 30:03.320
Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Wynn, your tasting specialist.

30:03.320 --> 30:12.440
I have tasted everything, the royal flush of oral sex, girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,

30:12.440 --> 30:16.800
and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.880
But today, we amuse the palate with the feminine penis.

30:21.040 --> 30:26.800
Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis has more sweetness than the masculine

30:26.800 --> 30:35.280
penis and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick umami.

30:35.280 --> 30:40.800
With respect to mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the

30:40.800 --> 30:44.360
masculine penis and does not become as turgid.

30:44.360 --> 30:51.800
And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes

30:51.800 --> 30:57.840
of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.

30:57.840 --> 31:05.960
It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
Cheers!

31:06.960 --> 31:15.120
8.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.600
Being straight is pretty gay.

31:16.600 --> 31:21.760
So I've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately

31:21.760 --> 31:26.960
you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with

31:26.960 --> 31:29.360
a trans woman is sex with a woman.

31:29.360 --> 31:33.880
Now we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.

31:33.880 --> 31:38.440
Reality is complicated, and while it's undeniable that many straight men are attracted to trans

31:38.440 --> 31:45.320
women, the messy reality is that a lot of straight men are also attracted to male cross-dressers.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.280
Before I transitioned I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super womanly either,

31:49.280 --> 31:51.640
like fully Dr. Frankenfurter.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.280
And that's why I'm so iconic.

31:53.280 --> 31:58.320
I showed the world that in two years you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter

31:58.320 --> 32:02.000
to a very real, very biological drag queen.

32:02.120 --> 32:08.000
But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got semi-regular messages from men

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
being like,

32:09.000 --> 32:14.080
So I'm a straight man, but I'm like really attracted to you when you dress as a woman

32:14.080 --> 32:17.640
and it's really making me question my sexuality.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.880
Now I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like,

32:20.880 --> 32:25.320
Well maybe those men just picked up on my inherently womanly female energy essence that

32:25.320 --> 32:31.680
I've always had since I was born a female biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-dressing baby.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.960
But let's be real.

32:32.960 --> 32:37.000
There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers, there are straight men who fuck drag queens,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.760
there are straight identifying men who fuck other straight identifying men.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.040
What is going on here?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
Straight men?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
What is your deal?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
Who are you?

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
What is your life?

32:47.040 --> 32:48.040
How did you become straight?

32:48.040 --> 32:49.040
Did they recruit you?

32:49.040 --> 32:50.040
Were you groomed?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.040
I blame the parents.

32:51.040 --> 32:54.400
Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call Is This Gay?

32:54.400 --> 32:59.400
The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they're sex acts between people

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
of the same gender.

33:00.640 --> 33:05.120
But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's gay,

33:05.120 --> 33:08.640
or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.

33:08.640 --> 33:13.520
To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam's nipples,

33:13.520 --> 33:16.000
and according to these men, it's totally gay.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.120
What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a

33:21.120 --> 33:22.160
man and a woman.

33:22.160 --> 33:26.560
It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who

33:26.560 --> 33:28.400
are playing the correct roles.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.640
So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according

33:32.640 --> 33:37.040
to this very fragile view of heterosexuality, he ceases to be straight.

33:37.040 --> 33:41.400
Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.560
For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary

33:46.560 --> 33:51.600
twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.920
I mean to be fair, before I washed my asshole I was a quarterback.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
Now I'm a cheerleader.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.800
D-I-C-T-R-O-Y don't tell the coach I was a guy.

33:59.800 --> 34:04.440
This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me

34:04.440 --> 34:08.880
of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.240
Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must

34:13.240 --> 34:17.880
be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck

34:17.880 --> 34:21.680
and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws.

34:21.680 --> 34:27.640
I think this hyper-masculine hetero-man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of

34:27.640 --> 34:32.520
kosher law governing straightness, and the is-this-gay game is its theology.

34:32.520 --> 34:37.200
Now this whole line of thinking has been reduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all

34:37.200 --> 34:39.280
people, Count Dankula.

34:39.280 --> 34:44.640
If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're

34:44.640 --> 34:47.480
touching a dick, and that's gay.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.320
Well memed my lord, well memed.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.640
The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when Dankula concludes that since

34:54.640 --> 35:00.280
a woman inherits half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore

35:00.280 --> 35:03.840
having sex with a woman is pretty gay.

35:03.840 --> 35:08.920
Obviously this is shitposting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps

35:08.920 --> 35:10.840
are gay because chromosomes.

35:10.840 --> 35:15.160
So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.320
So what is being gay?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.320
Socrates.

35:18.560 --> 35:22.200
Mm, on second thought, I don't know her.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.200
9.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.800
Being gay is good, actually.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.000
Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's

35:29.000 --> 35:32.560
good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the

35:32.560 --> 35:33.560
first place?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.800
Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?

35:36.800 --> 35:41.680
It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with

35:41.680 --> 35:45.400
manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs.

35:45.480 --> 35:49.240
Now men, this might be difficult to hear, and maybe you don't want to hear it from

35:49.240 --> 35:54.360
me, but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting

35:54.360 --> 35:56.840
trans women, and it's hurting gay people.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.680
For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.560
Who wants to sleep with a guy who's so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
even enjoy his own body?

36:05.560 --> 36:08.360
Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.800
Being pegged does not make you gay.

36:10.800 --> 36:15.240
Sucking another man's dick just to try it does not make you gay.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
And why?

36:16.240 --> 36:21.520
Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is

36:21.520 --> 36:24.720
persistently attracted to people of the same gender.

36:24.720 --> 36:28.560
If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender and you identify with the

36:28.560 --> 36:30.800
word gay, then you're gay.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.520
If not, then you're not, and nothing you can do will change that.

36:34.520 --> 36:38.800
So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
good actually.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.440
I mean why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?

36:43.440 --> 36:48.080
Now, I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.080
We the gays.

36:49.080 --> 36:55.240
But as a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight

36:55.240 --> 36:59.200
men are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.760
But that is not a wound I'm going to dwell on, because life is much too short for me

37:03.760 --> 37:07.840
to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.

37:07.840 --> 37:08.840
Are traps gay?

37:08.840 --> 37:10.720
Baby, who cares?

37:10.720 --> 37:12.160
Just do what feels good.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.920
That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say,

37:15.920 --> 37:18.320
traps are gay but there's nothing wrong with being gay,

37:18.320 --> 37:23.640
that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men and to reinforce the stigma

37:23.640 --> 37:28.880
against dating us among the group of people who are in fact most attracted to us.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.880
Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.

37:32.880 --> 37:37.360
And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted

37:37.360 --> 37:39.960
to us are willing to openly date us.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.000
And the stigma is very real.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.040
A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.

37:47.040 --> 37:51.800
Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they

37:51.800 --> 37:57.160
experience, in short, a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.

37:57.160 --> 38:02.720
But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices

38:02.720 --> 38:03.960
control his life.

38:03.960 --> 38:09.880
A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.

38:09.880 --> 38:15.960
A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.

38:15.960 --> 38:23.400
And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a

38:23.400 --> 38:25.320
man than you.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.240
10. I have feelings too.

38:37.320 --> 38:43.880
Well, I guess today we learned that rTrapsGay is not a debate worth winning, because just

38:43.880 --> 38:49.880
by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the bigoted assumptions

38:49.880 --> 38:51.160
it relies on.

38:51.160 --> 38:55.600
Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
deserved.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.800
Hashtag not all gamers.

38:57.800 --> 39:04.280
But also, this video completely centers men's feelings, and I have feelings too goddammit.

39:04.280 --> 39:09.320
And some of those feelings are not all that different from the anxieties men have.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.000
Let me explain.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Let me explain.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.960
So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology

39:17.960 --> 39:19.880
for confused slutbag.

39:19.880 --> 39:25.560
Before I transitioned I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbonical feelings,

39:25.560 --> 39:30.360
but early on in my transition I encountered a lot of TERF shit, and it really scared me

39:30.360 --> 39:32.680
off dating cis lesbians, which I never have.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.760
Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back

39:36.760 --> 39:38.680
of my head for a long time.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.960
But about a year ago I was like, I want to fuck men.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.040
I want to fuck men.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.280
But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.

39:48.280 --> 39:53.320
Because men are scary, and in my early transition I'd only dated bisexual trans people in enbies,

39:53.320 --> 39:56.760
and as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.040
A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.

40:00.040 --> 40:03.640
If that teaches you something about gender, it might be hard to learn otherwise.

40:03.640 --> 40:09.880
And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real

40:09.880 --> 40:15.400
woman, but to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as the radiant model

40:15.400 --> 40:19.320
of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.

40:19.320 --> 40:24.360
And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing out.

40:24.360 --> 40:28.160
But what I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group

40:28.160 --> 40:32.160
of people to date when you're early in transition, because they're pretty chill about anatomy

40:32.160 --> 40:33.160
and presentation.

40:33.160 --> 40:36.960
But if you're going to date cis-het men, you need to be serving women.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.800
And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.000
And I did wonder if I was woman enough for it.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
So the first couple times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off is

40:46.000 --> 40:48.280
he going to think I'm a man?

40:48.280 --> 40:50.720
Basically my anxiety was are traps gay?

40:50.720 --> 40:53.440
But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.920
And of course, you start by sucking dick.

40:55.920 --> 41:01.200
That's very safe, because like, what red-blooded man is going to turn down a t-girl blowjob?

41:01.200 --> 41:03.400
And it doesn't involve my junk in any way.

41:03.400 --> 41:07.720
Then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned

41:07.720 --> 41:12.560
we'd been guy friends, so to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between

41:12.560 --> 41:16.240
a man and a woman, like, that shit is super hot.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.720
Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on me,

41:20.720 --> 41:25.280
and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man, what if he's

41:25.280 --> 41:26.280
repulsed?

41:26.280 --> 41:29.440
Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.320
The answer is yes.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.640
It was so hot.

41:33.640 --> 41:38.360
I loved it, he loved it, and just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would

41:38.360 --> 41:43.320
just say it's special, 10 out of 10.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.800
And you know what he told me after?

41:44.800 --> 41:48.760
He told me he liked the mouth feel.

41:48.760 --> 41:51.320
Everyone's talking about it now, bitches!

41:51.360 --> 41:56.520
So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,

41:56.520 --> 42:01.400
because I mean, I was anxious too in the other direction, but I do want to shame men for

42:01.400 --> 42:06.520
treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets, and I do want to shame men for dehumanizing

42:06.520 --> 42:11.000
us and voting away our rights by day while jerking off to shemale porn by night, and

42:11.000 --> 42:15.480
I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong enough

42:15.480 --> 42:20.320
to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every

42:20.320 --> 42:25.280
moment of every day, and I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends

42:25.280 --> 42:29.560
because they couldn't stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.160
That is pathetic.

42:31.160 --> 42:35.520
If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up

42:35.520 --> 42:38.820
for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards?

42:38.820 --> 42:41.960
So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.800
Don't call human beings traps.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.800
If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.640
It's okay, you can date us.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.600
We're more than just jack-off material.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.200
If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.

42:54.200 --> 42:58.040
If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess because god knows she's been through

42:58.040 --> 42:59.040
enough shit.

42:59.040 --> 43:03.640
And finally, protect trans women of color at all costs.

43:03.640 --> 43:06.280
All I want here is basic human decency.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.920
Is that really too much to ask?

43:08.920 --> 43:14.840
Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.840
God damn it.

43:23.160 --> 43:26.720
Well, that was long.

43:26.720 --> 43:34.240
I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful

43:34.240 --> 43:36.240
woman's penis.

43:45.440 --> 43:54.440
You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully unaware

43:54.440 --> 44:00.440
of how crude, heard before, bigoted and plain rude.

44:00.440 --> 44:03.840
All the things that you say come up every day.

44:03.840 --> 44:10.840
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

44:10.840 --> 44:18.840
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who find us.

44:32.840 --> 44:39.840
There is one thing that I cannot stand, and it's you, dear, head in the sand.

44:39.840 --> 44:46.840
It's not really ignorance much, it's the willful bigots who find us.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.840
Don't let them define us.
