1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,380
My soul for sure, if I persist in gazing, if I persist in gazing,

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:41,360
In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,460
incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female

4
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,060
souls accidentally born into male bodies.

5
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,660
Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight

6
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,440
men who love themselves.

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,180
For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia, New Greek for love

8
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,060
of oneself as a woman.

9
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,380
It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,060
and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:32,980
okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.

12
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,580
One just what the hell do I think I'm doing?

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,700
Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,380
a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially

15
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,220
increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,220
face.

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,940
After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:03,660
misrepresentations of trans women, so it's understandable that to a lot of trans women

19
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,060
the prospect of this concept gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.

20
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,460
However, I respond to that as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals.

21
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,540
I've had several conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,460
they believe in Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.

23
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,100
So as I see it, the damage is already done.

24
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,660
What's needed now is an accessible, convincing refutation of the theory.

25
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,340
I hope this video will accomplish three things.

26
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,540
One, persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.

27
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,980
Two, account for how a wrong theory became so influential.

28
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,020
And three, move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people, and open up a deeper discussion

29
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,660
about what it really means to be transgender.

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,020
Socrates, you know the drill.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,420
2. Blanchard's Typology

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,580
The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender

33
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,540
Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people transition

34
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,760
is to alleviate gender dysphoria.

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,360
angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,560
transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,760
This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.

39
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,480
However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,560
According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,400
He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused.

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,680
Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,720
And yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,280
The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
These gay boys cannot get enough dick.

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,680
And who can blame them?

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,000
Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,320
because 1.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,360
Society is more accepting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,080
heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,280
These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
I'd fuck myself.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,720
It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women,

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,240
which is their true motivation to transition.

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,960
Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,640
that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,600
to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,680
I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,920
language, let's say cluster A and cluster B.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,840
Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic, that is, attracted to men.

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,000
They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,400
Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,800
later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,360
When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,440
I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
them.

72
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,720
Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B.

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,520
But as I've thought about it more, it's partially unraveled.

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,000
Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who followed

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
all the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,160
B patterns but now exclusively dates men.

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,940
So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,240
clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.

79
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct

80
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,720
types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,600
And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexual strategy or

82
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,720
autogynephilic lust are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,680
here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,580
Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard

85
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,560
has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking

86
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
liars.

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,200
A theory that can't be falsified.

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
It's perfect.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
3.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,040
The Man Who Would Be Queen

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,200
Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,000
fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given a major

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,600
publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard's

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,320
theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.

96
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Great cover, Bailey.

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,480
Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
I have been triggered.

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Well done.

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, was just amazingly bad.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,320
The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,360
transphobic but also kind of vivid and well-written, and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard's typology.

103
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,600
The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,120
male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex workers.

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:08:03,360
Wow, Bailey.

106
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
Great science writing.

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,080
When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,640
transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls

109
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,120
Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic masturbation.

110
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,240
Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses

111
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,240
while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction, all to the accompaniment

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,760
of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.

113
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
So well done, Bailey.

115
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,960
You've found an honest-to-god perver.

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,080
And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
I admire it.

118
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
I want it in my life.

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,200
But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,320
You just found a...

121
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
You just found a person who built a sex robot.

122
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,520
That's not how Bailey sees it, though.

123
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,040
He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephilic transsexual, claiming that

124
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,520
Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't

125
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,360
exclusively attracted to men.

126
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,000
So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,080
up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they were women in order

128
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,520
to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.

129
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defensive Blanchard's theory, Bailey's

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,800
account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,160
Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher, pursuing the light

132
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,760
of truth wherever it may lead, unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness

133
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
alike.

134
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
You're so filthy.

135
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,160
But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,600
What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?

137
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Well, for the most part it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,840
women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.

139
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,760
Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.

140
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,560
You need a research assistant, Bailey?

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
The man who would be queen is filled with sentences like

142
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,560
There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer it, so I'll just go ahead.

143
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,520
Alright you edgy fuck, let's hear it.

144
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:19,800
Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.

145
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,480
We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,080
But is this science?

147
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,360
It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery that young straight chicks are

148
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,320
hotter than middle-aged lesbians, and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.

149
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,480
And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century regarding the nature

150
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,800
of females and homosexuals, their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some

151
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
vital perspective.

152
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,960
This is what we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,920
cishet male perspective.

154
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,960
It's not that I hate men or male sexuality, I just hate that the male sexual perspective

155
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,040
is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.

156
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,480
It's not that there is no objective truth, it's that this represents a very narrow window

157
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
on it.

158
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,600
Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,520
Well, how about mine?

160
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Four.

161
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,840
My perspective.

162
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,600
From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.

163
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,840
He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern, was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.

164
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Google it.

165
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,400
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.

166
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard to sacrifice

167
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,060
a trans baby to Beelzebub, it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness

168
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,400
of the theory, which might still be true.

169
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,320
The problem is, it isn't true, which I'll argue at length in a moment.

170
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,320
But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial

171
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,840
number of academics and journalists, largely because 1.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,200
It's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative to mushy platitudes

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,960
about women born in men's bodies, and 2.

174
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,000
Many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard with extreme vitriol and personal

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,900
attacks, resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks are throwing

176
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,560
a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call

177
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,800
them out as paraphilic fetishists.

178
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,400
In her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger, bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey

179
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,400
as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob, but she gets so caught up in

180
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,600
exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him and in telling a bigger story

181
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks that she doesn't

182
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,960
bother to check how good Bailey's science really is, and ends up affirming the autogynephilia

183
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
theory herself.

184
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Now I'm certainly not going to deny that trans people on the internet can sometimes

185
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,980
behave like a bit of an angry mob, in fact I may be on the receiving end of one of those

186
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,080
myself in about, oh, 20 minutes depending on how this video is received.

187
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,960
But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and

188
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
Bailey camp either.

189
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,480
Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors, and

190
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,280
Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory of trans backlash against Bailey.

191
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,760
Remember, according to autogynephilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on

192
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,960
themselves, from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that

193
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,480
they're narcissists, and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation

194
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,120
is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.

195
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,

196
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,700
Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks has not really interfered with

197
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,920
their academic careers, nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less

198
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
power than them.

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,960
This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,

200
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,640
and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?

201
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,640
So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question, pursuing the

202
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,760
pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel, relying only on the facts, the figures,

203
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,320
the scientific studies.

204
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Just kidding.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia, read Julius Serrano's

206
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
article, The Case Against Autogynephilia, which pretty much sums it up.

207
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
science.

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,160
You came here because you wanted filth, and I'll give you filth, Bailey.

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,880
I know that's what you want, and I want to give you what you want.

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,320
I want to give it all up for you.

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Five, the false dichotomy.

213
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
Filth is coming, don't worry, but before we get there, there's one more thing we

214
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,800
need to discuss.

215
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,240
Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it as if it were the

216
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,720
only possible alternative to what's called the Feminine Essence Theory.

217
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,280
The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls in male bodies, that

218
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,360
we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to make our

219
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,600
accidental exterior match our essential interior.

220
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,400
People like Draeger will tell you that trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory,

221
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,440
and that anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.

222
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's

223
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,240
typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.

224
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,280
Now I object to this framing of the discussion because I don't believe in Blanchard's

225
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
typology or the Feminine Essence Theory.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,280
There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.

227
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
I wasn't born a woman.

228
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,200
I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.

229
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,740
There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.

230
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,380
There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of

231
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,580
which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.

232
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,660
Now there is an emotional appeal to the Feminine Essence Theory.

233
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,900
I think most people have gender-essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some

234
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,060
level that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.

235
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,860
And in a sense that may be true.

236
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,920
I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent

237
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,500
in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.

238
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,420
But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually

239
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,180
I don't think makes sense.

240
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,060
I think it's heartwarming gibberish.

241
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,480
But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.

242
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,140
Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that

243
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,660
dogs go to heaven.

244
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,300
And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point

245
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
across.

246
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Not all language is philosophical.

247
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,220
It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.

248
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,820
To explain it without gender essentialism, it requires a whole complicated philosophical

249
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,980
discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.

250
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,300
But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start

251
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,020
putting these things under the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans

252
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,420
people are just fetishists who are telling lies about themselves.

253
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,580
So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,

254
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,300
then why am I transitioning?

255
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,620
Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.

256
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,860
And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.

257
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,100
You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.

258
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,820
When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery

259
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,460
store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family, if you even still

260
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
have a family.

261
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,060
It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory

262
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
urge.

263
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,860
That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?

264
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,820
Well of course there goddamn is!

265
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,240
How could an adult decide to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality?

266
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,820
The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,

267
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,180
and it certainly isn't in my case.

268
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,380
But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing

269
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,740
in erotic situations, no less.

270
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,900
According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.

271
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,420
It seems that I have some explaining to do.

272
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,300
Well, here's where the filth comes in.

273
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
6.

274
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,740
Contrapoints in erotic life

275
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,540
Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.

276
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,580
Step right up, you filthy freaks.

277
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,420
One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that

278
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,860
even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and

279
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
invalidating.

280
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,100
Fortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to

281
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,620
take one for the team here.

282
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,300
Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!

283
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,260
I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.

284
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,500
I was born in 1988.

285
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,940
As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.

286
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,020
I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.

287
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,820
My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.

288
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,140
In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too

289
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,180
much time in the shower and spending too much time styling my hair.

290
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
My sexual development was kind of late.

291
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,140
I never masturbated until I was 15.

292
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,340
And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming

293
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
a woman.

294
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,020
My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.

295
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,740
I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.

296
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,440
An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be attracted

297
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,940
to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.

298
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,500
In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which

299
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,660
suited me well.

300
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,340
It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could

301
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,540
dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup.

302
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,300
God yes, I said.

303
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,020
Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization

304
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,100
dynamic.

305
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,820
More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.

306
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,900
When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just

307
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,100
sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?

308
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,460
Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear

309
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,940
drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.

310
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,100
There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,820
more than a couple years.

312
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,780
When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order

313
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,620
for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.

314
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,140
The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.

315
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,700
There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.

316
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,460
Bailey are you paying attention to this?

317
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,540
This is for you.

318
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,620
What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted

319
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,740
with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.

320
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,060
I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.

321
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,060
There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive

322
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,140
aspect.

323
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,580
But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.

324
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,300
It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized, it was affirming.

325
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,740
And one day I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.

326
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,140
I wanted to be feminine.

327
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,420
In my mid-twenties I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking

328
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,260
about transitioning myself, but I thought that since I didn't feel like a woman that

329
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,300
I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous

330
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
parody of womanhood.

331
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,100
Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I

332
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,580
started developing more positive thinking about this.

333
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,420
I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started

334
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,780
noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man.

335
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,900
And that triggered really intense gender dysphoria.

336
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,800
At the same time I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely

337
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,220
fulfilling sex life.

338
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,200
And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.

339
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,940
So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in

340
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,420
August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.

341
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,320
And since then, my life has drastically changed.

342
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,840
I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones

343
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,100
certainly do have sexual effects.

344
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,860
I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman

345
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,660
no longer turns me on the way it did.

346
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,860
Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.

347
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,140
I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't cum in months.

348
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,340
Someone please fuck me.

349
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,980
I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven

350
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,780
consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for 0% of the time.

351
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,540
So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous.

352
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,060
And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.

353
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,900
I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.

354
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,700
But I'm not like, ah yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.

355
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,960
I mean, it's kind of hot.

356
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,660
But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me being into it.

357
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,280
So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.

358
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,840
The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed

359
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
inward.

360
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,800
It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body,

361
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,080
or at least as close as I can get.

362
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,560
And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically

363
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:04,620
female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection, rather than intense

364
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,000
object-oriented male lust.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct

366
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,400
cuckoldry or trans ideology.

367
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,920
Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the

368
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
hook for autogynephilia.

369
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,520
In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudo-bisexual behavioral

370
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
autogynephilia.

371
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,880
Pseudo-bisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because

372
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes me

373
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,760
feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.

374
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,920
And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,

375
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,680
transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,240
And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female

377
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,280
clothes or having female anatomy.

378
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,960
And I mean okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,

379
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,960
and pathological, but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience,

380
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
and here's why.

381
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
7.

382
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Autophilia in General

383
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind

384
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,920
of sexual interest in their own bodies.

385
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,800
It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.

386
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Ew.

387
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,360
But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight

388
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,960
or touch of your own body?

389
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,120
I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises, and taking pictures

390
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,520
of their penises, and sending them to other people.

391
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,080
Does that make them auto-androphiles?

392
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,960
Are they behavioral autophallophiles?

393
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,400
I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.

394
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,560
I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,

395
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,080
it's not for men, it's for me.

396
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
What does that mean?

397
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,360
It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot.

398
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?

399
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,440
Likewise, I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women

400
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,600
touching their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.

401
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,080
Is that anatomical autogynephilia?

402
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,120
Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article

403
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,600
on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own

404
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,960
feet or running a feather over their skin, as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length

405
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo.

406
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if

407
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,960
it was written by a trans woman?

408
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,680
I mean, it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.

409
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,440
And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only

410
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,680
when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia."

411
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,040
It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality

412
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,920
when it exists in trans women.

413
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,560
But of course that raises the question, what is normal female sexuality?

414
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,920
Switching from male to female hormones causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated

415
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,560
and then regrown in new form, which came as more of a relief to me than I expected.

416
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession

417
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,440
or alien infection until I was free of it, thank God.

418
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned

419
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,800
on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I

420
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,480
had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks.

421
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,700
No, not autogynephilia.

422
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,720
On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,900
very different patterns of arousal.

424
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:52,300
For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues

425
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,980
like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction

426
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,180
to women versus men, and the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.

427
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,620
Oh, by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone daily.

428
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,260
So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,

429
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,860
at least for a girl who's into girls.

430
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,340
I don't feel like I have some essentially male pseudo-bisexual behavioral autogynephilia.

431
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,300
One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is

432
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,580
he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more

433
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,500
like cis men than cis women.

434
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,980
His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply

435
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,540
his autogynephilia survey to cis women.

436
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,940
But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were

437
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
classified as autogynephilic.

438
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,540
Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality

439
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,620
makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.

440
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,620
But what do cis women want to have sex as, walruses?

441
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,700
I mean, no judgments.

442
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,860
This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual,

443
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,860
because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.

444
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,420
The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,

445
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,540
so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.

446
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,140
That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.

447
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,060
But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?

448
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,540
Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?

449
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,340
I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.

450
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,660
But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust

451
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,140
for the male body.

452
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,060
That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk

453
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,980
painting with broad strokes.

454
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,480
Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside

455
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,840
naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart, and later on ended

456
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,940
up just being read by gay men.

457
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,220
From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have

458
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,820
great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.

459
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,420
But it's not that great.

460
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,380
And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and

461
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,820
not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.

462
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,260
Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description

463
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,800
of Christian's hot bod and his hot abs, but it's not the main thing by any means.

464
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,920
There's a lot more sentences like,

465
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,520
To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.

466
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,960
It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know, modern fireplace.

467
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,080
Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by 16 chairs.

468
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,600
And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.

469
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,420
Here, he hands me a glass of wine.

470
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,580
Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.

471
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,340
It's like a crate-and-barrel catalog.

472
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,140
I'm getting so wet.

473
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,940
Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,

474
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,260
his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone

475
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,580
who's qualified.

476
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,580
It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment, I mean,

477
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,180
they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.

478
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
They whistle at me.

479
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,200
And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

480
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,320
You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,

481
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
selects you, the protagonist.

482
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,360
This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.

483
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,880
It's not a story about wanting a man.

484
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,160
It's a story about being wanted by a man.

485
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,440
This is how the whole romance genre works.

486
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,040
You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like

487
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,500
a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this

488
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,060
guy wants you, the protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and

489
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,900
eventually giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.

490
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,260
And a lot of these stories are kind of silly, they conflate female sexuality with women's

491
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,900
economic dependence on men in a way that's really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate

492
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,620
with the wish to be wanted.

493
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?

494
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,520
It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.

495
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Is that so wrong?

496
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,040
The art critic John Berker wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting

497
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,360
trope of depicting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.

498
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,880
The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.

499
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,640
Demoralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.

500
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,020
You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.

501
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,380
You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning

502
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,780
the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.

503
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,700
The real function of the mirror was otherwise.

504
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,860
It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.

505
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:11,420
The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.

506
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,340
It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy

507
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,140
looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.

508
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,780
I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this

509
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,340
trope with a homophobic trope.

510
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,740
Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts

511
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,220
queer men as hypersexual perverts.

512
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,020
The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly

513
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,340
in love with the image of himself as a woman.

514
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,100
If I see single...

515
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,020
10. Autogynephilia Acceptance

516
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,060
So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation from which I have

517
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
to exonerate myself.

518
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,060
And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people

519
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,460
might wonder, isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shamey, like, is autogynephilia

520
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
so wrong?

521
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,780
Well, no, it's not.

522
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
It's fine.

523
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,260
There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about

524
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,060
having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless and I don't think it's

525
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,300
anything to be ashamed of.

526
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,940
But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women exist is more complicated.

527
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,020
The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such a stigma is that,

528
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,220
as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.

529
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,740
Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia

530
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,540
to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have.

531
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,740
But I'm actually inclined to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought

532
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,140
of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign

533
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
to me.

534
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,860
So a lot of trans women, I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a

535
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,900
woman and an autogynephile, hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way.

536
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
However, things get messier when you look into this some more.

537
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,580
Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?

538
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,260
Well, at first glance, the answer is yes.

539
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,700
I mean, there's always one, isn't there?

540
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,100
In this case, that one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified

541
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,940
autogynephilic transsexual.

542
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,980
From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over

543
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,420
the internet and published them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies.

544
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Great title, Anne.

545
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,540
Very provocative.

546
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,860
Very controversial.

547
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,340
Very politically incorrect.

548
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,540
I have been triggered.

549
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Well done.

550
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,020
What is this cover, though?

551
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
Come on, Anne.

552
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,420
Get a statue of Hermaphroditus or something on there.

553
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,300
So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty

554
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,380
autogynephilia-like fantasy and behavior.

555
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,980
So what do we make of that?

556
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,900
Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being women or having sex as women or arousal

557
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,980
during cross-dressing, are what the trans community has de-stigmatizingly termed cross-sex

558
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,300
gender fantasy.

559
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,900
And among trans women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty

560
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,900
common.

561
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,260
You'll see it all over the place on trans subreddits, there's a blog called Cross Dreamers

562
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,340
devoted to it, it's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serrano.

563
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,220
So within the trans community, this isn't even controversial.

564
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,260
It's not provocative, it's not politically incorrect.

565
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,180
But how do we make sense of this?

566
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,580
Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience genuine female sexuality when

567
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,820
you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system, so you've gotta get that

568
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,060
out and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away.

569
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,540
But how is this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia?

570
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,460
Well basically it comes down to this.

571
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:55,140
Blanchard's theory claims that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential.

572
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,660
In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic transsexual, you are essentially male, and

573
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,740
any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be honestly understood as the expression

574
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,060
of an essentially male sexual urge.

575
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,380
I reject the idea that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence

576
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,140
that it isn't essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic

577
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,460
admit that after transition, the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue

578
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,860
to prefer living as trans women.

579
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,300
Blanchard made this observation himself.

580
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,620
Any viable theory relating to the etiologies of autogynephilia and transsexualism must

581
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,060
explain the following well-established observation.

582
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,420
Gender dysphoria in young non-homosexual males usually appears along with or subsequent to

583
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,900
autogynephilia.

584
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,900
In later years, however, autogynephilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear, while the

585
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,620
transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger.

586
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,420
The same conclusion is suggested by the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment,

587
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,020
which decrease libido and gender dysphorics, as in other men, usually have no effect on

588
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,140
the desire to live as female or the resolve to remain in that role.

589
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,380
If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women,

590
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,020
why would they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away?

591
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,820
Well, this is where things get really weird.

592
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,060
According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to shift the goalpost

593
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,380
and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all, it's actually a sexual

594
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,700
orientation.

595
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,980
So what happens when you transition is you actually pair-bond with yourself, forming

596
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,900
a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've become.

597
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,300
And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.

598
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,700
A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people.

599
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,420
Are you saying that trans women are a man and a woman inside the...

600
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,100
Why do they continue falling in love with other people and...

601
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I can't even start with this.

602
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,940
This video is too long, I'm getting cranky.

603
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,580
Look, this seems like the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory.

604
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,540
Like okay, maybe I subconsciously created a female alter-ego with which my original

605
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,460
male ego has fallen in love.

606
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,260
But maybe lots of things.

607
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,040
Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father.

608
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,380
Maybe the Elder Gods ripped my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for

609
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,700
my female half.

610
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,220
Or maybe I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.

611
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,220
11.

612
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,780
True Autogynephiles

613
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,120
Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts

614
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,800
of trans women whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does

615
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
appear to be genuinely autogynephilic.

616
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,080
And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences, because that

617
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,760
would be a terrible thing to do.

618
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,080
Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about judging people, so I'm not gonna say

619
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,800
that these people aren't really trans.

620
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,720
I mean, I find it weird and hard to imagine, but whatever.

621
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.

622
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,320
And wait till you see my sex robot.

623
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,080
And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings, I would just tell you.

624
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,440
I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own diary on my deathbed.

625
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
But I just don't.

626
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,240
This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations to transition, and that's ultimately

627
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,840
the reason most trans women hate this theory, not because of wounded narcissism or shattered

628
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,560
erotic delusions, we just don't like being misrepresented.

629
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,360
But you know who does love this theory?

630
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
She's been there literally the whole time.

631
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,320
You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless

632
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,760
psychoanalysis, whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at

633
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,240
me for even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves.

634
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
So you know what?

635
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,520
Why don't we just get that out of the way right now?

636
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,080
It's time to put this tranny on trial.

637
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
12.

638
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,680
The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints

639
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
All rise.

640
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,400
The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.

641
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,760
Judge Bailey presiding.

642
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,480
Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus ContraPoints.

643
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
Are both sides ready?

644
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,840
District Attorney Cockbain, ready for the subreddit, your honor?

645
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,200
Ready I guess.

646
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Your honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man.

647
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,520
A full-grown, six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.

648
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
It's really more of a hospital gown?

649
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,040
The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert roleplaying

650
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,840
as such for his own twisted sexual amusement.

651
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Abigail, what are you holding?

652
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,680
It's for horseback riding.

653
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,280
Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip, uploaded to YouTube

654
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,280
by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.

655
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
Oh god.

656
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Fishnets.

657
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Garter belts.

658
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
Corsets.

659
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,920
If you're not the trappings of an autogynephile, then I don't have two X chromosomes.

660
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Agreed.

661
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,760
Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

662
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,240
Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?

663
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,600
The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.

664
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,680
I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.

665
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
What?

666
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
Rocky Horror Picture Show.

667
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,240
I used to do Frankenfurter.

668
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,560
Your honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.

669
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,120
That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014.

670
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,600
This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.

671
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,880
Are you a Rocky Horror fan, your honor?

672
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Am I?

673
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,440
It's just a jump.

674
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
To the left.

675
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,160
And take a step to the right.

676
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Put your hands on your hips.

677
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
And bring your knees in tight.

678
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
But it's the pelvic thrust.

679
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Ew.

680
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,680
So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.

681
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,320
How is that helping your case at all?

682
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,720
Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic, but when you're living as a man, there aren't

683
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,480
a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.

684
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,280
You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time it's socially allowed

685
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,880
to be a freakish monster.

686
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,960
And come to think of it, the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with

687
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
since the beginning of this channel.

688
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,440
The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very, like, autogynephilia chic.

689
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,880
I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.

690
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,360
The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.

691
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,520
And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.

692
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,680
I thought I was just disgusting.

693
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,960
Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something

694
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,000
of the horror of gender dysphoria.

695
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,560
And part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version of yourself is actually

696
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,160
kind of empowering.

697
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,440
Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches.

698
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,160
Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and

699
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
corsets.

700
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
This is just male fetishism.

701
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,600
Well, it's true that cis women generally don't dress that way, no.

702
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,400
I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually pretty popular.

703
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,920
But I never wear shit like that anymore.

704
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,920
In fact, it actually causes gender dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male crossdresser.

705
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,400
Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women wear.

706
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,840
I guess that's true.

707
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,700
A lot of trans women transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a crossdresser

708
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,120
or a drag queen.

709
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,760
But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion.

710
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,080
Like, what did you wear when you were 14?

711
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Wake me up!

712
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Wake me up inside!

713
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Wake up!

714
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,160
That's what I thought.

715
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,960
But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?

716
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Cis women do.

717
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,620
They have some good ideas.

718
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,380
Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers.

719
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,400
And what would we do then, Abigail?

720
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
What would we do then?

721
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,680
I don't know what you would do.

722
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,040
I think I could manage.

723
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,160
Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.

724
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Is there a way to smash my ribs in?

725
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
I'll smash them in.

726
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,680
I'll smash the shit out of them.

727
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,040
These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

728
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,160
Would you fuck me?

729
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
I wouldn't.

730
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,560
Your honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and corsets in front of a mirror

731
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,120
before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me?

732
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,520
This, your honor, is peak trans.

733
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,760
Peak trans.

734
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,520
Peak trans.

735
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
How do we even need to have a trial about this?

736
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,760
Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish, not sexual pleasure.

737
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,600
Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs, and is what is known

738
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,880
in the trans community as a joke.

739
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,040
The corsets, the high heels, these were primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood,

740
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,840
and they're efforts that I've left behind.

741
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,040
Now that I'm on female hormones and I live this way full time, I feel the way I'm supposed

742
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,000
to feel, and I don't need to lean on that stuff for validation.

743
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,640
I mean I still do some things that cis women don't do.

744
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,320
I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done.

745
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I do it because I need to feel something, god, anything, taking up space on my chest.

746
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,240
And feeling that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep.

747
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,040
Not so I can look at myself in the mirror.

748
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,360
Not so I can get off.

749
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,080
So I can simply fall asleep.

750
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,440
No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women.

751
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,400
We have many experiences in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different.

752
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,040
Yes, and you don't have the oppression experiences that cis women have.

753
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,520
Well you know what, Abigail?

754
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
You're right.

755
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,120
For the most part, I don't.

756
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,480
But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're just

757
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,680
such a fucking asshole.

758
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,040
And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences, don't have

759
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,680
this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.

760
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,360
Go find someone who transitioned decades ago and talk to them about their experiences as women.

761
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,600
Your honor, the defendant does not bleed.

762
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,160
I find that pretty conclusive.

763
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
As do I.

764
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Guilty as charged.

765
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,280
13.

766
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
Final Thoughts

767
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,800
I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video.

768
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,120
Some of them will say things like,

769
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,800
Why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences as you?

770
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,960
Well I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to think

771
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,840
a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this.

772
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,360
It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis

773
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,360
of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me.

774
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,720
I've had to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that

775
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,600
people will never take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness.

776
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,880
For trans women, this debate is intensely personal and risky.

777
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,040
Our lives and happiness are at stake.

778
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,800
Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth.

779
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,600
They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and cruel toward trans people, and they've

780
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,920
misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us.

781
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,960
No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.

782
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,640
I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity, but I am at

783
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,120
core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself.

784
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,400
So I have to hope, for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by

785
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
someone who thinks of me as a woman.

786
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,240
Otherwise, I'm fucked.

787
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,800
This has been a rough one, girls.

788
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,120
I dare say you've earned a song.

789
00:46:51,120 --> 00:47:03,120
Thanks for the times that you've given me.

790
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:12,120
The memories are all on my mind.

791
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:27,120
Now that we've come to the end of our rainbow, there's something I must say out loud.

792
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:52,120
You're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do.

793
00:47:52,120 --> 00:48:20,120
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do, and I love you.

794
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,120
One more time.

795
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,120
And just a step to the right.

796
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Put your hands on your hips.

797
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,120
And bring your knees in tight.

798
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:39,120
It's just a pelvic thrust that really drives me insane.

799
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Let's do the time warp again.

800
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,120
Let's do the time warp again.
