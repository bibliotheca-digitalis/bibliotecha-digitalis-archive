0	18380	My soul for sure, if I persist in gazing, if I persist in gazing,
18380	41360	In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically
41360	46460	incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female
46460	49060	souls accidentally born into male bodies.
49060	54660	Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight
54660	56440	men who love themselves.
56440	61180	For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia, New Greek for love
61180	63060	of oneself as a woman.
63060	67380	It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,
67380	71060	and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which
71060	92980	okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.
92980	96580	One just what the hell do I think I'm doing?
96580	100700	Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but
100700	105380	a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially
105380	110220	increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already
110220	111220	face.
111220	115940	After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted
115940	123660	misrepresentations of trans women, so it's understandable that to a lot of trans women
123660	128060	the prospect of this concept gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.
128180	132460	However, I respond to that as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals.
132460	136540	I've had several conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that
136540	140460	they believe in Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.
140460	143100	So as I see it, the damage is already done.
143100	146660	What's needed now is an accessible, convincing refutation of the theory.
146660	149340	I hope this video will accomplish three things.
149340	152540	One, persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.
152540	155980	Two, account for how a wrong theory became so influential.
155980	161020	And three, move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people, and open up a deeper discussion
161020	163660	about what it really means to be transgender.
163660	166020	Socrates, you know the drill.
166020	170420	2. Blanchard's Typology
170420	174580	The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender
174580	180540	Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people transition
180540	182760	is to alleviate gender dysphoria.
182760	188760	Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial
188760	193360	angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically
193360	196560	transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.
196560	200760	This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.
200760	204480	However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.
204480	209560	According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.
209560	214400	He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused.
214400	217040	You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.
217040	221680	Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men.
221680	224720	And yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end.
224720	227280	The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.
227280	229360	These gay boys cannot get enough dick.
229360	230680	And who can blame them?
230680	236000	Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition
236000	237320	because 1.
237320	241360	Society is more accepting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.
241360	245240	Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the
245240	250080	heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.
250080	253920	The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.
253920	257280	These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.
257280	259280	I'd fuck myself.
259280	264400	Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.
264400	268720	It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected
268720	273520	inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women,
273520	275240	which is their true motivation to transition.
275240	278960	Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge
278960	283640	that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend
283640	286600	to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.
286600	291680	I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral
291680	294920	language, let's say cluster A and cluster B.
294920	298840	Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic, that is, attracted to men.
298840	303000	They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.
303000	307400	Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively
307400	310800	later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.
310800	314360	When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.
314360	318440	I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort
318440	319440	them.
319440	321720	Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B.
321720	324520	But as I've thought about it more, it's partially unraveled.
324520	328000	Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who followed
328000	332400	all the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster
332400	335160	B patterns but now exclusively dates men.
335160	339940	So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation
339940	342240	clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.
342240	347280	Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct
347280	351720	types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.
351720	356600	And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexual strategy or
356600	361720	autogynephilic lust are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup
361720	366680	here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.
366680	370580	Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard
370580	375560	has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking
375560	376560	liars.
376560	379000	I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?
379000	381200	A theory that can't be falsified.
381200	382600	It's perfect.
382600	383600	3.
383600	387040	The Man Who Would Be Queen
387040	391200	Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before
391200	396000	fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given a major
396000	401600	publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard's
401600	406320	theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.
406320	407800	Great cover, Bailey.
407800	411480	Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.
411480	412880	I have been triggered.
412880	413880	Well done.
413880	419480	Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, was just amazingly bad.
419480	423320	The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely
423320	429360	transphobic but also kind of vivid and well-written, and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard's typology.
429360	433600	The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his
433600	439120	male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex workers.
463600	483360	Wow, Bailey.
483360	484640	Great science writing.
484640	489080	When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic
489080	493640	transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls
493640	500120	Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic masturbation.
500120	505240	Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses
505240	510240	while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction, all to the accompaniment
510240	513760	of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.
513760	516800	It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.
516800	518080	So well done, Bailey.
518080	519960	You've found an honest-to-god perver.
519960	523080	And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.
523080	524080	I admire it.
524080	525080	I want it in my life.
525080	530200	But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.
530200	532320	You just found a...
532320	535680	You just found a person who built a sex robot.
535680	537520	That's not how Bailey sees it, though.
537520	542040	He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephilic transsexual, claiming that
542040	546520	Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't
546520	548360	exclusively attracted to men.
548360	553000	So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing
553000	557080	up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they were women in order
557080	560520	to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.
560520	564720	Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defensive Blanchard's theory, Bailey's
564720	567800	account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.
567800	572160	Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher, pursuing the light
572160	576760	of truth wherever it may lead, unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness
576760	577760	alike.
577760	578760	You're so filthy.
578760	582160	But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?
582160	584600	What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?
584600	589600	Well, for the most part it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans
589600	592840	women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.
592840	595760	Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.
595760	597560	You need a research assistant, Bailey?
597600	600200	The man who would be queen is filled with sentences like
600200	608560	There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer it, so I'll just go ahead.
608560	611520	Alright you edgy fuck, let's hear it.
611520	619800	Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.
619800	622480	We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.
622480	624080	But is this science?
624080	628360	It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery that young straight chicks are
628360	633320	hotter than middle-aged lesbians, and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.
633320	637480	And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century regarding the nature
637480	642800	of females and homosexuals, their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some
642800	644200	vital perspective.
644200	648960	This is what we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white
648960	650920	cishet male perspective.
650920	655960	It's not that I hate men or male sexuality, I just hate that the male sexual perspective
655960	659040	is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.
659040	663480	It's not that there is no objective truth, it's that this represents a very narrow window
663480	664480	on it.
664480	666600	Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?
666600	668520	Well, how about mine?
668520	671520	Four.
671520	672840	My perspective.
672840	676600	From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.
676600	681840	He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern, was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.
681840	682840	Google it.
682840	686400	Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.
686400	690120	Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard to sacrifice
690120	695060	a trans baby to Beelzebub, it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness
695060	697400	of the theory, which might still be true.
697400	701320	The problem is, it isn't true, which I'll argue at length in a moment.
701320	705320	But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial
705320	708840	number of academics and journalists, largely because 1.
708840	713200	It's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative to mushy platitudes
713200	715960	about women born in men's bodies, and 2.
715960	720000	Many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard with extreme vitriol and personal
720000	724900	attacks, resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks are throwing
724900	729560	a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call
729560	731800	them out as paraphilic fetishists.
731800	736400	In her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger, bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey
736400	741400	as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob, but she gets so caught up in
741400	745600	exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him and in telling a bigger story
745600	750320	about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks that she doesn't
750320	754960	bother to check how good Bailey's science really is, and ends up affirming the autogynephilia
754960	755960	theory herself.
755960	759640	Now I'm certainly not going to deny that trans people on the internet can sometimes
759640	763980	behave like a bit of an angry mob, in fact I may be on the receiving end of one of those
763980	768080	myself in about, oh, 20 minutes depending on how this video is received.
768080	771960	But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and
771960	773160	Bailey camp either.
773160	777480	Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors, and
777480	782280	Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory of trans backlash against Bailey.
782280	786760	Remember, according to autogynephilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on
786760	790960	themselves, from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that
790960	795480	they're narcissists, and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation
795480	800120	is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.
800120	804360	Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,
804360	809700	Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks has not really interfered with
809700	813920	their academic careers, nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less
813920	814920	power than them.
815000	819960	This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,
819960	822640	and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?
822640	826640	So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question, pursuing the
826640	831760	pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel, relying only on the facts, the figures,
831760	833320	the scientific studies.
833320	834320	Just kidding.
834320	838560	If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia, read Julius Serrano's
838560	842480	article, The Case Against Autogynephilia, which pretty much sums it up.
842480	846000	Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about
846000	847000	science.
847000	850160	You came here because you wanted filth, and I'll give you filth, Bailey.
850160	853880	I know that's what you want, and I want to give you what you want.
853880	856320	I want to give it all up for you.
856320	862480	Five, the false dichotomy.
862480	866160	Filth is coming, don't worry, but before we get there, there's one more thing we
866160	867800	need to discuss.
867800	871240	Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it as if it were the
871240	875720	only possible alternative to what's called the Feminine Essence Theory.
875720	880280	The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls in male bodies, that
880280	884360	we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to make our
884360	887600	accidental exterior match our essential interior.
887600	893400	People like Draeger will tell you that trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory,
893400	897440	and that anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.
897440	901360	And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's
901360	905240	typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.
905240	909280	Now I object to this framing of the discussion because I don't believe in Blanchard's
909280	912000	typology or the Feminine Essence Theory.
912000	915280	There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.
915280	917120	I wasn't born a woman.
917120	921200	I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.
921200	924740	There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.
924740	929380	There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of
929380	933580	which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.
933580	936660	Now there is an emotional appeal to the Feminine Essence Theory.
936660	941900	I think most people have gender-essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some
941900	945060	level that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.
945060	946860	And in a sense that may be true.
946860	950920	I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent
950920	954500	in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.
954500	958420	But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually
958420	960180	I don't think makes sense.
960180	962060	I think it's heartwarming gibberish.
962060	967480	But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.
967480	971140	Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that
971140	972660	dogs go to heaven.
972660	977300	And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point
977300	978300	across.
978300	980300	Not all language is philosophical.
980300	984220	It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.
984220	988820	To explain it without gender essentialism, it requires a whole complicated philosophical
988820	991980	discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.
991980	996300	But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start
996300	1000020	putting these things under the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans
1000020	1003420	people are just fetishists who are telling lies about themselves.
1003420	1007580	So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,
1007580	1009300	then why am I transitioning?
1009300	1013620	Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.
1013620	1017860	And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.
1017860	1021100	You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.
1021100	1024820	When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery
1024820	1029460	store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family, if you even still
1029460	1030460	have a family.
1030460	1035060	It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory
1035060	1036060	urge.
1036100	1039860	That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?
1039860	1041820	Well of course there goddamn is!
1041820	1046240	How could an adult decide to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality?
1046240	1050820	The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,
1050820	1053180	and it certainly isn't in my case.
1053180	1057380	But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing
1057380	1059740	in erotic situations, no less.
1059740	1062900	According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.
1062900	1065420	It seems that I have some explaining to do.
1065420	1067300	Well, here's where the filth comes in.
1067300	1068300	6.
1068300	1071740	Contrapoints in erotic life
1071740	1075540	Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.
1075540	1077580	Step right up, you filthy freaks.
1077580	1081420	One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that
1081420	1085860	even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and
1085860	1086860	invalidating.
1086860	1091100	Fortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to
1091100	1092620	take one for the team here.
1092620	1094300	Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!
1094300	1099260	I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.
1099260	1101500	I was born in 1988.
1101500	1105940	As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.
1105940	1111020	I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.
1111020	1114820	My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.
1114820	1120140	In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too
1120140	1124180	much time in the shower and spending too much time styling my hair.
1124180	1126180	My sexual development was kind of late.
1126180	1129140	I never masturbated until I was 15.
1129140	1134340	And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming
1134340	1135340	a woman.
1135340	1138020	My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.
1138020	1142740	I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.
1142740	1147440	An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be attracted
1147440	1150940	to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.
1150940	1155500	In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which
1155500	1156660	suited me well.
1156660	1161340	It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could
1161340	1164540	dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup.
1164540	1167300	God yes, I said.
1167300	1171020	Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization
1171020	1172100	dynamic.
1172100	1175820	More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.
1175820	1179900	When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just
1179900	1183100	sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?
1183100	1187460	Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear
1187460	1189940	drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.
1189940	1194100	There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last
1194100	1195820	more than a couple years.
1195820	1200780	When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order
1200780	1203620	for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.
1203620	1207140	The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.
1207140	1210700	There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.
1210700	1212460	Bailey are you paying attention to this?
1212460	1213540	This is for you.
1213540	1217620	What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted
1217620	1220740	with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.
1220740	1225060	I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.
1225060	1231060	There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive
1231060	1232140	aspect.
1232140	1236580	But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.
1236580	1240300	It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized, it was affirming.
1240300	1244740	And one day I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.
1244740	1247140	I wanted to be feminine.
1247140	1251420	In my mid-twenties I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking
1251420	1256260	about transitioning myself, but I thought that since I didn't feel like a woman that
1256260	1260300	I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous
1260300	1261300	parody of womanhood.
1261300	1266100	Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I
1266100	1268580	started developing more positive thinking about this.
1268580	1272420	I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started
1272420	1276780	noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man.
1276780	1279900	And that triggered really intense gender dysphoria.
1279900	1283800	At the same time I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely
1283800	1285220	fulfilling sex life.
1285220	1289200	And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.
1289200	1293940	So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in
1293940	1298420	August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.
1298420	1301320	And since then, my life has drastically changed.
1301320	1305840	I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones
1305840	1308100	certainly do have sexual effects.
1308100	1313860	I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman
1313860	1316660	no longer turns me on the way it did.
1316660	1320860	Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.
1320860	1324140	I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't cum in months.
1324140	1325340	Someone please fuck me.
1325340	1329980	I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven
1329980	1334780	consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for 0% of the time.
1334780	1338540	So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous.
1338540	1342060	And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.
1342060	1344900	I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.
1344900	1347700	But I'm not like, ah yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.
1347700	1349960	I mean, it's kind of hot.
1349960	1354660	But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me being into it.
1354660	1358280	So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.
1358280	1362840	The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed
1362840	1363840	inward.
1363840	1369800	It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body,
1369800	1372080	or at least as close as I can get.
1372080	1376560	And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically
1376560	1384620	female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection, rather than intense
1384620	1388000	object-oriented male lust.
1388000	1392320	So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct
1392320	1396400	cuckoldry or trans ideology.
1396400	1399920	Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the
1399920	1400920	hook for autogynephilia.
1401480	1406520	In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudo-bisexual behavioral
1406520	1407520	autogynephilia.
1407520	1412880	Pseudo-bisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because
1412880	1417120	according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes me
1417120	1419760	feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.
1419760	1424920	And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,
1424920	1429680	transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.
1429920	1434240	And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female
1434240	1436280	clothes or having female anatomy.
1436280	1440960	And I mean okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,
1440960	1445960	and pathological, but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience,
1445960	1447960	and here's why.
1447960	1450720	7.
1450720	1451720	Autophilia in General
1451720	1455640	I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind
1455640	1457920	of sexual interest in their own bodies.
1457920	1460800	It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.
1460800	1461800	Ew.
1461800	1466360	But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight
1466360	1467960	or touch of your own body?
1467960	1473120	I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises, and taking pictures
1473120	1476520	of their penises, and sending them to other people.
1476520	1479080	Does that make them auto-androphiles?
1479080	1481960	Are they behavioral autophallophiles?
1481960	1484400	I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.
1484400	1488560	I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,
1488560	1491080	it's not for men, it's for me.
1491080	1492080	What does that mean?
1492080	1497360	It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot.
1497360	1500000	Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?
1500000	1505440	Likewise, I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women
1505440	1510600	touching their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.
1510600	1513080	Is that anatomical autogynephilia?
1513080	1518120	Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article
1518120	1523600	on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own
1523600	1528960	feet or running a feather over their skin, as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length
1528960	1533600	mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo.
1533600	1537440	Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if
1537440	1538960	it was written by a trans woman?
1538960	1542680	I mean, it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.
1542680	1547440	And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only
1547440	1551680	when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia."
1551680	1556040	It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality
1556040	1557920	when it exists in trans women.
1557920	1562560	But of course that raises the question, what is normal female sexuality?
1567560	1571920	Switching from male to female hormones causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated
1571960	1576560	and then regrown in new form, which came as more of a relief to me than I expected.
1576560	1581400	I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession
1581400	1585440	or alien infection until I was free of it, thank God.
1585440	1589600	When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned
1589600	1594800	on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I
1594800	1598480	had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks.
1598480	1600700	No, not autogynephilia.
1600700	1604720	On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing
1604720	1606900	very different patterns of arousal.
1606900	1612300	For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues
1612300	1617980	like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction
1617980	1622180	to women versus men, and the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.
1622180	1628620	Oh, by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone daily.
1628620	1633260	So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,
1633260	1634860	at least for a girl who's into girls.
1634860	1640340	I don't feel like I have some essentially male pseudo-bisexual behavioral autogynephilia.
1640340	1644300	One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is
1644300	1648580	he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more
1648580	1650500	like cis men than cis women.
1650500	1654980	His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply
1654980	1657540	his autogynephilia survey to cis women.
1657540	1661940	But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were
1661940	1663980	classified as autogynephilic.
1663980	1669540	Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality
1669540	1674620	makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.
1674620	1677620	But what do cis women want to have sex as, walruses?
1677620	1679700	I mean, no judgments.
1679700	1685860	This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual,
1685860	1689860	because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.
1689860	1695420	The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,
1695420	1700540	so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.
1700540	1705140	That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.
1705140	1708060	But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?
1708060	1711540	Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?
1711540	1716340	I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.
1716340	1722660	But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust
1722660	1724140	for the male body.
1724140	1729060	That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk
1729060	1730980	painting with broad strokes.
1730980	1735480	Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside
1735480	1739840	naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart, and later on ended
1739840	1741940	up just being read by gay men.
1741940	1746220	From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have
1746220	1750820	great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.
1750820	1752420	But it's not that great.
1752420	1756380	And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and
1756380	1761820	not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.
1761820	1766260	Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description
1766260	1770800	of Christian's hot bod and his hot abs, but it's not the main thing by any means.
1770800	1772920	There's a lot more sentences like,
1772920	1777520	To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.
1777520	1783960	It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know, modern fireplace.
1783960	1790080	Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by 16 chairs.
1790080	1794600	And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.
1794620	1797420	Here, he hands me a glass of wine.
1797420	1801580	Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.
1801580	1803340	It's like a crate-and-barrel catalog.
1803340	1805140	I'm getting so wet.
1805140	1809940	Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,
1809940	1815260	his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone
1815260	1816580	who's qualified.
1816580	1820580	It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment, I mean,
1820580	1823180	they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.
1823180	1824180	They whistle at me.
1824440	1828200	And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.
1828200	1832320	You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,
1832320	1834400	selects you, the protagonist.
1834400	1838360	This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.
1838360	1840880	It's not a story about wanting a man.
1840880	1844160	It's a story about being wanted by a man.
1844160	1846440	This is how the whole romance genre works.
1846440	1851040	You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like
1851040	1856500	a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this
1856500	1862060	guy wants you, the protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and
1862060	1865900	eventually giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.
1865900	1870260	And a lot of these stories are kind of silly, they conflate female sexuality with women's
1870260	1876900	economic dependence on men in a way that's really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate
1876900	1878620	with the wish to be wanted.
1878640	1882000	I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?
1882000	1885520	It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.
1885520	1886520	Is that so wrong?
1891240	1896040	The art critic John Berker wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting
1896040	1901360	trope of depicting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.
1901360	1904880	The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.
1904880	1907640	Demoralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.
1907640	1911020	You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.
1911020	1915380	You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning
1915380	1918780	the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.
1918780	1920700	The real function of the mirror was otherwise.
1920700	1925860	It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.
1925860	1931420	The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.
1931420	1936340	It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy
1936340	1940140	looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.
1940140	1944780	I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this
1944780	1947340	trope with a homophobic trope.
1947340	1952740	Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts
1952740	1955220	queer men as hypersexual perverts.
1955220	1960020	The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly
1960020	1962340	in love with the image of himself as a woman.
1966340	1972100	If I see single...
1972100	1977020	10. Autogynephilia Acceptance
1977020	1981060	So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation from which I have
1981060	1982740	to exonerate myself.
1982740	1987060	And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people
1987060	1992460	might wonder, isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shamey, like, is autogynephilia
1992460	1993460	so wrong?
1993460	1995780	Well, no, it's not.
1995780	1996780	It's fine.
1996780	2000260	There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about
2000260	2005060	having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless and I don't think it's
2005060	2006300	anything to be ashamed of.
2006300	2010940	But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women exist is more complicated.
2010940	2016020	The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such a stigma is that,
2016020	2021220	as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.
2021220	2025740	Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia
2026300	2030540	to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have.
2030540	2034740	But I'm actually inclined to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought
2034740	2040140	of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign
2040140	2041140	to me.
2041140	2044860	So a lot of trans women, I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a
2044860	2049900	woman and an autogynephile, hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way.
2049900	2052900	However, things get messier when you look into this some more.
2052900	2055580	Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?
2055580	2058260	Well, at first glance, the answer is yes.
2058260	2060700	I mean, there's always one, isn't there?
2060700	2065100	In this case, that one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified
2065100	2066940	autogynephilic transsexual.
2066940	2072980	From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over
2072980	2078420	the internet and published them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies.
2078420	2079420	Great title, Anne.
2079420	2080540	Very provocative.
2080540	2081860	Very controversial.
2081860	2083340	Very politically incorrect.
2083340	2084540	I have been triggered.
2084540	2085540	Well done.
2085540	2087020	What is this cover, though?
2087020	2088020	Come on, Anne.
2088020	2090420	Get a statue of Hermaphroditus or something on there.
2090420	2094300	So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty
2094300	2097380	autogynephilia-like fantasy and behavior.
2097380	2098980	So what do we make of that?
2098980	2103900	Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being women or having sex as women or arousal
2103900	2108980	during cross-dressing, are what the trans community has de-stigmatizingly termed cross-sex
2108980	2110300	gender fantasy.
2110300	2114900	And among trans women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty
2114900	2115900	common.
2115900	2120260	You'll see it all over the place on trans subreddits, there's a blog called Cross Dreamers
2120260	2124340	devoted to it, it's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serrano.
2124340	2127220	So within the trans community, this isn't even controversial.
2127220	2130260	It's not provocative, it's not politically incorrect.
2130260	2132180	But how do we make sense of this?
2132260	2136580	Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience genuine female sexuality when
2136580	2140820	you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system, so you've gotta get that
2140820	2144060	out and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away.
2144060	2147540	But how is this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia?
2147540	2149460	Well basically it comes down to this.
2149460	2155140	Blanchard's theory claims that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential.
2155140	2159660	In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic transsexual, you are essentially male, and
2159660	2164740	any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be honestly understood as the expression
2164740	2167060	of an essentially male sexual urge.
2167060	2171380	I reject the idea that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence
2171380	2176140	that it isn't essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic
2176140	2181460	admit that after transition, the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue
2181460	2183860	to prefer living as trans women.
2183860	2186300	Blanchard made this observation himself.
2186300	2190620	Any viable theory relating to the etiologies of autogynephilia and transsexualism must
2190620	2193060	explain the following well-established observation.
2193060	2197420	Gender dysphoria in young non-homosexual males usually appears along with or subsequent to
2197420	2198900	autogynephilia.
2198900	2202900	In later years, however, autogynephilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear, while the
2202900	2205620	transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger.
2205620	2209420	The same conclusion is suggested by the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment,
2209420	2213020	which decrease libido and gender dysphorics, as in other men, usually have no effect on
2213020	2216140	the desire to live as female or the resolve to remain in that role.
2216140	2220380	If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women,
2220380	2225020	why would they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away?
2225020	2227820	Well, this is where things get really weird.
2227820	2232060	According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to shift the goalpost
2232060	2237380	and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all, it's actually a sexual
2237380	2238700	orientation.
2238700	2242980	So what happens when you transition is you actually pair-bond with yourself, forming
2242980	2246900	a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've become.
2246900	2251300	And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.
2251300	2254700	A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people.
2254700	2258420	Are you saying that trans women are a man and a woman inside the...
2258420	2261100	Why do they continue falling in love with other people and...
2261100	2262100	I can't even start with this.
2262100	2263940	This video is too long, I'm getting cranky.
2263940	2267580	Look, this seems like the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory.
2267580	2272540	Like okay, maybe I subconsciously created a female alter-ego with which my original
2272540	2274460	male ego has fallen in love.
2274460	2276260	But maybe lots of things.
2276260	2280040	Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father.
2280040	2284380	Maybe the Elder Gods ripped my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for
2284380	2285700	my female half.
2285700	2289220	Or maybe I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.
2289220	2292220	11.
2292220	2293780	True Autogynephiles
2293780	2298120	Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts
2298120	2302800	of trans women whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does
2302800	2304600	appear to be genuinely autogynephilic.
2304600	2309080	And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences, because that
2309080	2311760	would be a terrible thing to do.
2311760	2316080	Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about judging people, so I'm not gonna say
2316080	2317800	that these people aren't really trans.
2317800	2322720	I mean, I find it weird and hard to imagine, but whatever.
2322720	2325400	I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.
2325400	2327320	And wait till you see my sex robot.
2327320	2331080	And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings, I would just tell you.
2331080	2335440	I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own diary on my deathbed.
2335440	2336960	But I just don't.
2336960	2341240	This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations to transition, and that's ultimately
2341240	2345840	the reason most trans women hate this theory, not because of wounded narcissism or shattered
2345840	2349560	erotic delusions, we just don't like being misrepresented.
2349560	2353360	But you know who does love this theory?
2353360	2355400	She's been there literally the whole time.
2355440	2359320	You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless
2359320	2363760	psychoanalysis, whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at
2363760	2369240	me for even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves.
2369240	2370240	So you know what?
2370240	2372520	Why don't we just get that out of the way right now?
2372520	2375080	It's time to put this tranny on trial.
2375080	2376080	12.
2376080	2379680	The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints
2379680	2380680	All rise.
2380680	2384400	The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.
2384400	2386760	Judge Bailey presiding.
2386760	2390480	Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus ContraPoints.
2390480	2393920	Are both sides ready?
2393920	2397840	District Attorney Cockbain, ready for the subreddit, your honor?
2397840	2399200	Ready I guess.
2399200	2403080	Your honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man.
2403080	2407520	A full-grown, six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.
2407520	2409280	It's really more of a hospital gown?
2409280	2414040	The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert roleplaying
2414040	2416840	as such for his own twisted sexual amusement.
2416840	2418840	Abigail, what are you holding?
2418840	2420680	It's for horseback riding.
2420680	2425280	Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip, uploaded to YouTube
2425280	2428280	by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.
2438280	2439280	Oh god.
2439280	2440280	Fishnets.
2440280	2441280	Garter belts.
2441280	2442280	Corsets.
2442520	2445920	If you're not the trappings of an autogynephile, then I don't have two X chromosomes.
2445920	2446920	Agreed.
2446920	2448760	Well, what do you have to say for yourself?
2448760	2452240	Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?
2452240	2455600	The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.
2455600	2457680	I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.
2457680	2458680	What?
2458680	2460160	Rocky Horror Picture Show.
2460160	2462240	I used to do Frankenfurter.
2462240	2465560	Your honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.
2465560	2468120	That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014.
2468120	2469600	This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.
2469600	2471880	Are you a Rocky Horror fan, your honor?
2471880	2472880	Am I?
2472880	2474440	It's just a jump.
2474440	2475440	To the left.
2475440	2479160	And take a step to the right.
2479160	2480160	Put your hands on your hips.
2480160	2481160	And bring your knees in tight.
2481160	2482160	But it's the pelvic thrust.
2482160	2483160	Ew.
2483160	2490680	So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.
2490680	2492320	How is that helping your case at all?
2492320	2497720	Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic, but when you're living as a man, there aren't
2497720	2501480	a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.
2501480	2506280	You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time it's socially allowed
2506280	2507880	to be a freakish monster.
2507880	2511960	And come to think of it, the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with
2511960	2513960	since the beginning of this channel.
2513960	2518440	The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very, like, autogynephilia chic.
2518440	2522880	I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.
2522880	2526360	The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.
2526360	2528520	And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.
2528520	2530680	I thought I was just disgusting.
2530680	2534960	Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something
2534960	2537000	of the horror of gender dysphoria.
2537000	2541560	And part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version of yourself is actually
2541560	2543160	kind of empowering.
2543160	2546440	Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches.
2546440	2551160	Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and
2551160	2552160	corsets.
2552160	2553160	This is just male fetishism.
2553160	2556600	Well, it's true that cis women generally don't dress that way, no.
2556600	2560400	I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually pretty popular.
2560400	2561920	But I never wear shit like that anymore.
2561920	2566920	In fact, it actually causes gender dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male crossdresser.
2566920	2570400	Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women wear.
2570400	2571840	I guess that's true.
2571840	2576700	A lot of trans women transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a crossdresser
2576700	2578120	or a drag queen.
2578120	2581760	But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion.
2581760	2584080	Like, what did you wear when you were 14?
2584080	2586080	Wake me up!
2586080	2588080	Wake me up inside!
2588080	2589080	Wake up!
2589760	2591160	That's what I thought.
2591160	2594960	But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?
2594960	2595960	Cis women do.
2595960	2597620	They have some good ideas.
2597620	2601380	Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers.
2601380	2603400	And what would we do then, Abigail?
2603400	2604400	What would we do then?
2604400	2605680	I don't know what you would do.
2605680	2607040	I think I could manage.
2607040	2610160	Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.
2610160	2613160	Is there a way to smash my ribs in?
2613160	2614160	I'll smash them in.
2614160	2616680	I'll smash the shit out of them.
2616680	2622040	These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.
2622040	2623160	Would you fuck me?
2623160	2624160	I wouldn't.
2624160	2629560	Your honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and corsets in front of a mirror
2629560	2633120	before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me?
2633120	2636520	This, your honor, is peak trans.
2636520	2638760	Peak trans.
2638760	2642520	Peak trans.
2642520	2644520	How do we even need to have a trial about this?
2644520	2648760	Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish, not sexual pleasure.
2648760	2652600	Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs, and is what is known
2652600	2654880	in the trans community as a joke.
2654880	2660040	The corsets, the high heels, these were primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood,
2660040	2661840	and they're efforts that I've left behind.
2661840	2666040	Now that I'm on female hormones and I live this way full time, I feel the way I'm supposed
2666040	2669000	to feel, and I don't need to lean on that stuff for validation.
2669000	2671640	I mean I still do some things that cis women don't do.
2671760	2675320	I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done.
2675320	2680320	I do it because I need to feel something, god, anything, taking up space on my chest.
2680320	2683240	And feeling that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep.
2683240	2685040	Not so I can look at myself in the mirror.
2685040	2686360	Not so I can get off.
2686360	2688080	So I can simply fall asleep.
2688080	2691440	No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women.
2691440	2695400	We have many experiences in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different.
2695400	2699040	Yes, and you don't have the oppression experiences that cis women have.
2699040	2700520	Well you know what, Abigail?
2700520	2701520	You're right.
2701520	2703120	For the most part, I don't.
2703120	2706480	But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're just
2706480	2707680	such a fucking asshole.
2707680	2712040	And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences, don't have
2712040	2715680	this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.
2715680	2720360	Go find someone who transitioned decades ago and talk to them about their experiences as women.
2720360	2722600	Your honor, the defendant does not bleed.
2722600	2724160	I find that pretty conclusive.
2724160	2725160	As do I.
2725160	2726160	Guilty as charged.

2728280	2729280	Final Thoughts
2729320	2733800	I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video.
2733800	2735120	Some of them will say things like,
2735120	2739800	Why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences as you?
2739800	2743960	Well I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to think
2743960	2747840	a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this.
2747840	2752360	It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis
2752360	2756360	of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me.
2756400	2760720	I've had to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that
2760720	2765600	people will never take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness.
2765600	2768880	For trans women, this debate is intensely personal and risky.
2768880	2771040	Our lives and happiness are at stake.
2771040	2775800	Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth.
2775800	2780600	They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and cruel toward trans people, and they've
2780600	2784920	misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us.
2784920	2788960	No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.
2788960	2793640	I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity, but I am at
2793640	2798120	core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself.
2798120	2802400	So I have to hope, for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by
2802400	2804720	someone who thinks of me as a woman.
2804720	2807240	Otherwise, I'm fucked.
2807240	2808800	This has been a rough one, girls.
2808800	2811120	I dare say you've earned a song.
2811120	2823120	Thanks for the times that you've given me.
2823120	2832120	The memories are all on my mind.
2833120	2847120	Now that we've come to the end of our rainbow, there's something I must say out loud.
2847120	2872120	You're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do.
2872120	2900120	Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do, and I love you.
2900120	2903120	One more time.
2903120	2906120	And just a step to the right.
2906120	2909120	Put your hands on your hips.
2909120	2912120	And bring your knees in tight.
2912120	2919120	It's just a pelvic thrust that really drives me insane.
2919120	2925120	Let's do the time warp again.
2925120	2931120	Let's do the time warp again.
