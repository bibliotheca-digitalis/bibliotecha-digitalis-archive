WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.380
My soul for sure, if I persist in gazing, if I persist in gazing,

00:18.380 --> 00:41.360
In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically

00:41.360 --> 00:46.460
incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female

00:46.460 --> 00:49.060
souls accidentally born into male bodies.

00:49.060 --> 00:54.660
Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight

00:54.660 --> 00:56.440
men who love themselves.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.180
For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia, New Greek for love

01:01.180 --> 01:03.060
of oneself as a woman.

01:03.060 --> 01:07.380
It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,

01:07.380 --> 01:11.060
and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which

01:11.060 --> 01:32.980
okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.580
One just what the hell do I think I'm doing?

01:36.580 --> 01:40.700
Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but

01:40.700 --> 01:45.380
a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially

01:45.380 --> 01:50.220
increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already

01:50.220 --> 01:51.220
face.

01:51.220 --> 01:55.940
After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted

01:55.940 --> 02:03.660
misrepresentations of trans women, so it's understandable that to a lot of trans women

02:03.660 --> 02:08.060
the prospect of this concept gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.

02:08.180 --> 02:12.460
However, I respond to that as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals.

02:12.460 --> 02:16.540
I've had several conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that

02:16.540 --> 02:20.460
they believe in Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.100
So as I see it, the damage is already done.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.660
What's needed now is an accessible, convincing refutation of the theory.

02:26.660 --> 02:29.340
I hope this video will accomplish three things.

02:29.340 --> 02:32.540
One, persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.980
Two, account for how a wrong theory became so influential.

02:35.980 --> 02:41.020
And three, move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people, and open up a deeper discussion

02:41.020 --> 02:43.660
about what it really means to be transgender.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.020
Socrates, you know the drill.

02:46.020 --> 02:50.420
2. Blanchard's Typology

02:50.420 --> 02:54.580
The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender

02:54.580 --> 03:00.540
Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people transition

03:00.540 --> 03:02.760
is to alleviate gender dysphoria.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.760
Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial

03:08.760 --> 03:13.360
angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically

03:13.360 --> 03:16.560
transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.760
This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.480
However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.

03:24.480 --> 03:29.560
According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.400
He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all are excused.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.040
You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.680
Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.720
And yeah, I know, just hold your objections for the end.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.280
The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.360
These gay boys cannot get enough dick.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.680
And who can blame them?

03:50.680 --> 03:56.000
Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men, who transition

03:56.000 --> 03:57.320
because 1.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.360
Society is more accepting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.240
Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the

04:05.240 --> 04:10.080
heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.920
The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.280
These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.280
I'd fuck myself.

04:19.280 --> 04:24.400
Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.720
It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is misdirected

04:28.720 --> 04:33.520
inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming women,

04:33.520 --> 04:35.240
which is their true motivation to transition.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.960
Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge

04:38.960 --> 04:43.640
that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend

04:43.640 --> 04:46.600
to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.680
I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral

04:51.680 --> 04:54.920
language, let's say cluster A and cluster B.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.840
Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic, that is, attracted to men.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.000
They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.400
Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively

05:07.400 --> 05:10.800
later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.360
When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.

05:14.360 --> 05:18.440
I went through the mental list of trans women I know and found I could pretty easily sort

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
them.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.720
Cluster A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Cluster B.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.520
But as I've thought about it more, it's partially unraveled.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.000
Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who followed

05:28.000 --> 05:32.400
all the Cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans woman who followed all the Cluster

05:32.400 --> 05:35.160
B patterns but now exclusively dates men.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.940
So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation

05:39.940 --> 05:42.240
clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.

05:42.240 --> 05:47.280
Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct

05:47.280 --> 05:51.720
types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.600
And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexual strategy or

05:56.600 --> 06:01.720
autogynephilic lust are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup

06:01.720 --> 06:06.680
here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.580
Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard

06:10.580 --> 06:15.560
has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking

06:15.560 --> 06:16.560
liars.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.000
I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.200
A theory that can't be falsified.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.600
It's perfect.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
3.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.040
The Man Who Would Be Queen

06:27.040 --> 06:31.200
Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before

06:31.200 --> 06:36.000
fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given a major

06:36.000 --> 06:41.600
publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed Blanchard's

06:41.600 --> 06:46.320
theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.800
Great cover, Bailey.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.480
Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.880
I have been triggered.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.880
Well done.

06:53.880 --> 06:59.480
Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, was just amazingly bad.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.320
The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely

07:03.320 --> 07:09.360
transphobic but also kind of vivid and well-written, and it introduced a wide audience to Blanchard's typology.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.600
The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his

07:13.600 --> 07:19.120
male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex workers.

07:43.600 --> 08:03.360
Wow, Bailey.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.640
Great science writing.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.080
When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic

08:09.080 --> 08:13.640
transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls

08:13.640 --> 08:20.120
Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic masturbation.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.240
Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses

08:25.240 --> 08:30.240
while receiving anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction, all to the accompaniment

08:30.240 --> 08:33.760
of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.800
It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.080
So well done, Bailey.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.960
You've found an honest-to-god perver.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.080
And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.080
I admire it.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
I want it in my life.

08:45.080 --> 08:50.200
But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.320
You just found a...

08:52.320 --> 08:55.680
You just found a person who built a sex robot.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.520
That's not how Bailey sees it, though.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.040
He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephilic transsexual, claiming that

09:02.040 --> 09:06.520
Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't

09:06.520 --> 09:08.360
exclusively attracted to men.

09:08.360 --> 09:13.000
So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing

09:13.000 --> 09:17.080
up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they were women in order

09:17.080 --> 09:20.520
to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.720
Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defensive Blanchard's theory, Bailey's

09:24.720 --> 09:27.800
account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.160
Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher, pursuing the light

09:32.160 --> 09:36.760
of truth wherever it may lead, unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness

09:36.760 --> 09:37.760
alike.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.760
You're so filthy.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.160
But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?

09:42.160 --> 09:44.600
What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?

09:44.600 --> 09:49.600
Well, for the most part it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago and chats up trans

09:49.600 --> 09:52.840
women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.760
Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.560
You need a research assistant, Bailey?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.200
The man who would be queen is filled with sentences like

10:00.200 --> 10:08.560
There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer it, so I'll just go ahead.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.520
Alright you edgy fuck, let's hear it.

10:11.520 --> 10:19.800
Most homosexual transsexuals are much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.480
We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.080
But is this science?

10:24.080 --> 10:28.360
It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery that young straight chicks are

10:28.360 --> 10:33.320
hotter than middle-aged lesbians, and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.480
And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century regarding the nature

10:37.480 --> 10:42.800
of females and homosexuals, their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some

10:42.800 --> 10:44.200
vital perspective.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.960
This is what we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white

10:48.960 --> 10:50.920
cishet male perspective.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.960
It's not that I hate men or male sexuality, I just hate that the male sexual perspective

10:55.960 --> 10:59.040
is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.

10:59.040 --> 11:03.480
It's not that there is no objective truth, it's that this represents a very narrow window

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
on it.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.600
Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.520
Well, how about mine?

11:08.520 --> 11:11.520
Four.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.840
My perspective.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.600
From my perspective, Michael Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.840
He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern, was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
Google it.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.400
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.120
Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard to sacrifice

11:30.120 --> 11:35.060
a trans baby to Beelzebub, it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness

11:35.060 --> 11:37.400
of the theory, which might still be true.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.320
The problem is, it isn't true, which I'll argue at length in a moment.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.320
But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance among a non-trivial

11:45.320 --> 11:48.840
number of academics and journalists, largely because 1.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.200
It's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative to mushy platitudes

11:53.200 --> 11:55.960
about women born in men's bodies, and 2.

11:55.960 --> 12:00.000
Many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard with extreme vitriol and personal

12:00.000 --> 12:04.900
attacks, resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks are throwing

12:04.900 --> 12:09.560
a narcissistic male entitlement temper tantrum because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call

12:09.560 --> 12:11.800
them out as paraphilic fetishists.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.400
In her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger, bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey

12:16.400 --> 12:21.400
as the undeserving victim of a hysterical SJW lynch mob, but she gets so caught up in

12:21.400 --> 12:25.600
exonerating Bailey of the personal accusations against him and in telling a bigger story

12:25.600 --> 12:30.320
about academic freedom and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks that she doesn't

12:30.320 --> 12:34.960
bother to check how good Bailey's science really is, and ends up affirming the autogynephilia

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
theory herself.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.640
Now I'm certainly not going to deny that trans people on the internet can sometimes

12:39.640 --> 12:43.980
behave like a bit of an angry mob, in fact I may be on the receiving end of one of those

12:43.980 --> 12:48.080
myself in about, oh, 20 minutes depending on how this video is received.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.960
But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression from the Blanchard and

12:51.960 --> 12:53.160
Bailey camp either.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.480
Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors, and

12:57.480 --> 13:02.280
Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory of trans backlash against Bailey.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.760
Remember, according to autogynephilia theory, many trans women are erotically fixated on

13:06.760 --> 13:10.960
themselves, from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap to saying that

13:10.960 --> 13:15.480
they're narcissists, and hence any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation

13:15.480 --> 13:20.120
is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.

13:20.120 --> 13:24.360
Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,

13:24.360 --> 13:29.700
Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks has not really interfered with

13:29.700 --> 13:33.920
their academic careers, nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less

13:33.920 --> 13:34.920
power than them.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.960
This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,

13:39.960 --> 13:42.640
and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?

13:42.640 --> 13:46.640
So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question, pursuing the

13:46.640 --> 13:51.760
pure light of truth, as we always do on this channel, relying only on the facts, the figures,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.320
the scientific studies.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.320
Just kidding.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.560
If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia, read Julius Serrano's

13:58.560 --> 14:02.480
article, The Case Against Autogynephilia, which pretty much sums it up.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.000
Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
science.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.160
You came here because you wanted filth, and I'll give you filth, Bailey.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.880
I know that's what you want, and I want to give you what you want.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.320
I want to give it all up for you.

14:16.320 --> 14:22.480
Five, the false dichotomy.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.160
Filth is coming, don't worry, but before we get there, there's one more thing we

14:26.160 --> 14:27.800
need to discuss.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.240
Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it as if it were the

14:31.240 --> 14:35.720
only possible alternative to what's called the Feminine Essence Theory.

14:35.720 --> 14:40.280
The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls in male bodies, that

14:40.280 --> 14:44.360
we are women from birth to death, and that transition is merely an effort to make our

14:44.360 --> 14:47.600
accidental exterior match our essential interior.

14:47.600 --> 14:53.400
People like Draeger will tell you that trans activists dogmatically adhere to this theory,

14:53.400 --> 14:57.440
and that anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.360
And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's

15:01.360 --> 15:05.240
typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.

15:05.240 --> 15:09.280
Now I object to this framing of the discussion because I don't believe in Blanchard's

15:09.280 --> 15:12.000
typology or the Feminine Essence Theory.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.280
There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.120
I wasn't born a woman.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.200
I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.740
There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.

15:24.740 --> 15:29.380
There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of

15:29.380 --> 15:33.580
which can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.660
Now there is an emotional appeal to the Feminine Essence Theory.

15:36.660 --> 15:41.900
I think most people have gender-essentialist intuitions, and I admit I do feel on some

15:41.900 --> 15:45.060
level that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.860
And in a sense that may be true.

15:46.860 --> 15:50.920
I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent

15:50.920 --> 15:54.500
in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.

15:54.500 --> 15:58.420
But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually

15:58.420 --> 16:00.180
I don't think makes sense.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.060
I think it's heartwarming gibberish.

16:02.060 --> 16:07.480
But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.140
Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that

16:11.140 --> 16:12.660
dogs go to heaven.

16:12.660 --> 16:17.300
And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point

16:17.300 --> 16:18.300
across.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
Not all language is philosophical.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.220
It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.

16:24.220 --> 16:28.820
To explain it without gender essentialism, it requires a whole complicated philosophical

16:28.820 --> 16:31.980
discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.

16:31.980 --> 16:36.300
But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start

16:36.300 --> 16:40.020
putting these things under the microscope, and then they end up concluding that trans

16:40.020 --> 16:43.420
people are just fetishists who are telling lies about themselves.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.580
So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,

16:47.580 --> 16:49.300
then why am I transitioning?

16:49.300 --> 16:53.620
Well I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.

16:53.620 --> 16:57.860
And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.100
You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.820
When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery

17:04.820 --> 17:09.460
store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family, if you even still

17:09.460 --> 17:10.460
have a family.

17:10.460 --> 17:15.060
It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory

17:15.060 --> 17:16.060
urge.

17:16.100 --> 17:19.860
That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?

17:19.860 --> 17:21.820
Well of course there goddamn is!

17:21.820 --> 17:26.240
How could an adult decide to switch genders without there being some connection to sexuality?

17:26.240 --> 17:30.820
The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,

17:30.820 --> 17:33.180
and it certainly isn't in my case.

17:33.180 --> 17:37.380
But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing

17:37.380 --> 17:39.740
in erotic situations, no less.

17:39.740 --> 17:42.900
According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.420
It seems that I have some explaining to do.

17:45.420 --> 17:47.300
Well, here's where the filth comes in.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.300
6.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.740
Contrapoints in erotic life

17:51.740 --> 17:55.540
Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.580
Step right up, you filthy freaks.

17:57.580 --> 18:01.420
One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that

18:01.420 --> 18:05.860
even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and

18:05.860 --> 18:06.860
invalidating.

18:06.860 --> 18:11.100
Fortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to

18:11.100 --> 18:12.620
take one for the team here.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.300
Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!

18:14.300 --> 18:19.260
I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.500
I was born in 1988.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.940
As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.

18:25.940 --> 18:31.020
I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.820
My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.

18:34.820 --> 18:40.140
In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD, the primary symptoms being spending too

18:40.140 --> 18:44.180
much time in the shower and spending too much time styling my hair.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.180
My sexual development was kind of late.

18:46.180 --> 18:49.140
I never masturbated until I was 15.

18:49.140 --> 18:54.340
And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming

18:54.340 --> 18:55.340
a woman.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.020
My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.

18:58.020 --> 19:02.740
I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.

19:02.740 --> 19:07.440
An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be attracted

19:07.440 --> 19:10.940
to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.

19:10.940 --> 19:15.500
In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which

19:15.500 --> 19:16.660
suited me well.

19:16.660 --> 19:21.340
It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could

19:21.340 --> 19:24.540
dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.300
God yes, I said.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.020
Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization

19:31.020 --> 19:32.100
dynamic.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.820
More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.

19:35.820 --> 19:39.900
When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just

19:39.900 --> 19:43.100
sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?

19:43.100 --> 19:47.460
Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear

19:47.460 --> 19:49.940
drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.100
There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last

19:54.100 --> 19:55.820
more than a couple years.

19:55.820 --> 20:00.780
When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order

20:00.780 --> 20:03.620
for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.140
The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.700
There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.460
Bailey are you paying attention to this?

20:12.460 --> 20:13.540
This is for you.

20:13.540 --> 20:17.620
What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted

20:17.620 --> 20:20.740
with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.

20:20.740 --> 20:25.060
I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.

20:25.060 --> 20:31.060
There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive

20:31.060 --> 20:32.140
aspect.

20:32.140 --> 20:36.580
But over time I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.

20:36.580 --> 20:40.300
It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized, it was affirming.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.740
And one day I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.

20:44.740 --> 20:47.140
I wanted to be feminine.

20:47.140 --> 20:51.420
In my mid-twenties I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking

20:51.420 --> 20:56.260
about transitioning myself, but I thought that since I didn't feel like a woman that

20:56.260 --> 21:00.300
I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous

21:00.300 --> 21:01.300
parody of womanhood.

21:01.300 --> 21:06.100
Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I

21:06.100 --> 21:08.580
started developing more positive thinking about this.

21:08.580 --> 21:12.420
I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started

21:12.420 --> 21:16.780
noticing the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man.

21:16.780 --> 21:19.900
And that triggered really intense gender dysphoria.

21:19.900 --> 21:23.800
At the same time I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely

21:23.800 --> 21:25.220
fulfilling sex life.

21:25.220 --> 21:29.200
And at that point the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.940
So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in

21:33.940 --> 21:38.420
August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.

21:38.420 --> 21:41.320
And since then, my life has drastically changed.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.840
I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones

21:45.840 --> 21:48.100
certainly do have sexual effects.

21:48.100 --> 21:53.860
I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman

21:53.860 --> 21:56.660
no longer turns me on the way it did.

21:56.660 --> 22:00.860
Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.

22:00.860 --> 22:04.140
I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't cum in months.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.340
Someone please fuck me.

22:05.340 --> 22:09.980
I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven

22:09.980 --> 22:14.780
consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for 0% of the time.

22:14.780 --> 22:18.540
So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestic fetishist is ridiculous.

22:18.540 --> 22:22.060
And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.

22:22.060 --> 22:24.900
I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.700
But I'm not like, ah yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.960
I mean, it's kind of hot.

22:29.960 --> 22:34.660
But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me being into it.

22:34.660 --> 22:38.280
So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.840
The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed

22:42.840 --> 22:43.840
inward.

22:43.840 --> 22:49.800
It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body,

22:49.800 --> 22:52.080
or at least as close as I can get.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.560
And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically

22:56.560 --> 23:04.620
female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection, rather than intense

23:04.620 --> 23:08.000
object-oriented male lust.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.320
So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct

23:12.320 --> 23:16.400
cuckoldry or trans ideology.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.920
Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the

23:19.920 --> 23:20.920
hook for autogynephilia.

23:21.480 --> 23:26.520
In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudo-bisexual behavioral

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
autogynephilia.

23:27.520 --> 23:32.880
Pseudo-bisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because

23:32.880 --> 23:37.120
according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes me

23:37.120 --> 23:39.760
feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.

23:39.760 --> 23:44.920
And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,

23:44.920 --> 23:49.680
transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.

23:49.920 --> 23:54.240
And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female

23:54.240 --> 23:56.280
clothes or having female anatomy.

23:56.280 --> 24:00.960
And I mean okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,

24:00.960 --> 24:05.960
and pathological, but I think this is an especially unfair way to characterize my experience,

24:05.960 --> 24:07.960
and here's why.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.720
7.

24:10.720 --> 24:11.720
Autophilia in General

24:11.720 --> 24:15.640
I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind

24:15.640 --> 24:17.920
of sexual interest in their own bodies.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.800
It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
Ew.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.360
But how unusual is it to check yourself out, to take some sexual interest in the sight

24:26.360 --> 24:27.960
or touch of your own body?

24:27.960 --> 24:33.120
I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises, and taking pictures

24:33.120 --> 24:36.520
of their penises, and sending them to other people.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.080
Does that make them auto-androphiles?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.960
Are they behavioral autophallophiles?

24:41.960 --> 24:44.400
I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.560
I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,

24:48.560 --> 24:51.080
it's not for men, it's for me.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.080
What does that mean?

24:52.080 --> 24:57.360
It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel hot.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.000
Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?

25:00.000 --> 25:05.440
Likewise, I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women

25:05.440 --> 25:10.600
touching their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.080
Is that anatomical autogynephilia?

25:13.080 --> 25:18.120
Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article

25:18.120 --> 25:23.600
on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own

25:23.600 --> 25:28.960
feet or running a feather over their skin, as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length

25:28.960 --> 25:33.600
mirror and rubbing one out, possibly while squatting on a dildo.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.440
Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if

25:37.440 --> 25:38.960
it was written by a trans woman?

25:38.960 --> 25:42.680
I mean, it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.

25:42.680 --> 25:47.440
And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only

25:47.440 --> 25:51.680
when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia."

25:51.680 --> 25:56.040
It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality

25:56.040 --> 25:57.920
when it exists in trans women.

25:57.920 --> 26:02.560
But of course that raises the question, what is normal female sexuality?

26:07.560 --> 26:11.920
Switching from male to female hormones causes your sex drive to be completely obliterated

26:11.960 --> 26:16.560
and then regrown in new form, which came as more of a relief to me than I expected.

26:16.560 --> 26:21.400
I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession

26:21.400 --> 26:25.440
or alien infection until I was free of it, thank God.

26:25.440 --> 26:29.600
When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned

26:29.600 --> 26:34.800
on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I

26:34.800 --> 26:38.480
had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.700
No, not autogynephilia.

26:40.700 --> 26:44.720
On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing

26:44.720 --> 26:46.900
very different patterns of arousal.

26:46.900 --> 26:52.300
For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues

26:52.300 --> 26:57.980
like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction

26:57.980 --> 27:02.180
to women versus men, and the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.

27:02.180 --> 27:08.620
Oh, by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone daily.

27:08.620 --> 27:13.260
So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,

27:13.260 --> 27:14.860
at least for a girl who's into girls.

27:14.860 --> 27:20.340
I don't feel like I have some essentially male pseudo-bisexual behavioral autogynephilia.

27:20.340 --> 27:24.300
One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is

27:24.300 --> 27:28.580
he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more

27:28.580 --> 27:30.500
like cis men than cis women.

27:30.500 --> 27:34.980
His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply

27:34.980 --> 27:37.540
his autogynephilia survey to cis women.

27:37.540 --> 27:41.940
But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were

27:41.940 --> 27:43.980
classified as autogynephilic.

27:43.980 --> 27:49.540
Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality

27:49.540 --> 27:54.620
makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.

27:54.620 --> 27:57.620
But what do cis women want to have sex as, walruses?

27:57.620 --> 27:59.700
I mean, no judgments.

27:59.700 --> 28:05.860
This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual,

28:05.860 --> 28:09.860
because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.

28:09.860 --> 28:15.420
The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,

28:15.420 --> 28:20.540
so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.

28:20.540 --> 28:25.140
That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.

28:25.140 --> 28:28.060
But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?

28:28.060 --> 28:31.540
Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?

28:31.540 --> 28:36.340
I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.

28:36.340 --> 28:42.660
But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust

28:42.660 --> 28:44.140
for the male body.

28:44.140 --> 28:49.060
That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk

28:49.060 --> 28:50.980
painting with broad strokes.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.480
Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside

28:55.480 --> 28:59.840
naked hunks but never had the circulation of its male counterpart, and later on ended

28:59.840 --> 29:01.940
up just being read by gay men.

29:01.940 --> 29:06.220
From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have

29:06.220 --> 29:10.820
great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.420
But it's not that great.

29:12.420 --> 29:16.380
And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and

29:16.380 --> 29:21.820
not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.

29:21.820 --> 29:26.260
Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description

29:26.260 --> 29:30.800
of Christian's hot bod and his hot abs, but it's not the main thing by any means.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.920
There's a lot more sentences like,

29:32.920 --> 29:37.520
To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.

29:37.520 --> 29:43.960
It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know, modern fireplace.

29:43.960 --> 29:50.080
Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by 16 chairs.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.600
And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.420
Here, he hands me a glass of wine.

29:57.420 --> 30:01.580
Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.

30:01.580 --> 30:03.340
It's like a crate-and-barrel catalog.

30:03.340 --> 30:05.140
I'm getting so wet.

30:05.140 --> 30:09.940
Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,

30:09.940 --> 30:15.260
his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone

30:15.260 --> 30:16.580
who's qualified.

30:16.580 --> 30:20.580
It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment, I mean,

30:20.580 --> 30:23.180
they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.180
They whistle at me.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.200
And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.320
You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.400
selects you, the protagonist.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.360
This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.880
It's not a story about wanting a man.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.160
It's a story about being wanted by a man.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.440
This is how the whole romance genre works.

30:46.440 --> 30:51.040
You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like

30:51.040 --> 30:56.500
a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this

30:56.500 --> 31:02.060
guy wants you, the protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and

31:02.060 --> 31:05.900
eventually giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.260
And a lot of these stories are kind of silly, they conflate female sexuality with women's

31:10.260 --> 31:16.900
economic dependence on men in a way that's really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate

31:16.900 --> 31:18.620
with the wish to be wanted.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.000
I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.520
It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.520
Is that so wrong?

31:31.240 --> 31:36.040
The art critic John Berker wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting

31:36.040 --> 31:41.360
trope of depicting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.880
The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.640
Demoralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.

31:47.640 --> 31:51.020
You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.

31:51.020 --> 31:55.380
You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning

31:55.380 --> 31:58.780
the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.

31:58.780 --> 32:00.700
The real function of the mirror was otherwise.

32:00.700 --> 32:05.860
It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.

32:05.860 --> 32:11.420
The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.

32:11.420 --> 32:16.340
It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy

32:16.340 --> 32:20.140
looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.

32:20.140 --> 32:24.780
I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this

32:24.780 --> 32:27.340
trope with a homophobic trope.

32:27.340 --> 32:32.740
Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts

32:32.740 --> 32:35.220
queer men as hypersexual perverts.

32:35.220 --> 32:40.020
The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly

32:40.020 --> 32:42.340
in love with the image of himself as a woman.

32:46.340 --> 32:52.100
If I see single...

32:52.100 --> 32:57.020
10. Autogynephilia Acceptance

32:57.020 --> 33:01.060
So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation from which I have

33:01.060 --> 33:02.740
to exonerate myself.

33:02.740 --> 33:07.060
And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people

33:07.060 --> 33:12.460
might wonder, isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shamey, like, is autogynephilia

33:12.460 --> 33:13.460
so wrong?

33:13.460 --> 33:15.780
Well, no, it's not.

33:15.780 --> 33:16.780
It's fine.

33:16.780 --> 33:20.260
There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about

33:20.260 --> 33:25.060
having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless and I don't think it's

33:25.060 --> 33:26.300
anything to be ashamed of.

33:26.300 --> 33:30.940
But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women exist is more complicated.

33:30.940 --> 33:36.020
The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such a stigma is that,

33:36.020 --> 33:41.220
as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.

33:41.220 --> 33:45.740
Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia

33:46.300 --> 33:50.540
to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have.

33:50.540 --> 33:54.740
But I'm actually inclined to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought

33:54.740 --> 34:00.140
of being a woman is a fundamentally non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign

34:00.140 --> 34:01.140
to me.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.860
So a lot of trans women, I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a

34:04.860 --> 34:09.900
woman and an autogynephile, hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.900
However, things get messier when you look into this some more.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.580
Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?

34:15.580 --> 34:18.260
Well, at first glance, the answer is yes.

34:18.260 --> 34:20.700
I mean, there's always one, isn't there?

34:20.700 --> 34:25.100
In this case, that one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified

34:25.100 --> 34:26.940
autogynephilic transsexual.

34:26.940 --> 34:32.980
From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over

34:32.980 --> 34:38.420
the internet and published them in her 2012 book Men Trapped in Men's Bodies.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.420
Great title, Anne.

34:39.420 --> 34:40.540
Very provocative.

34:40.540 --> 34:41.860
Very controversial.

34:41.860 --> 34:43.340
Very politically incorrect.

34:43.340 --> 34:44.540
I have been triggered.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.540
Well done.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.020
What is this cover, though?

34:47.020 --> 34:48.020
Come on, Anne.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.420
Get a statue of Hermaphroditus or something on there.

34:50.420 --> 34:54.300
So this book is filled with stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty

34:54.300 --> 34:57.380
autogynephilia-like fantasy and behavior.

34:57.380 --> 34:58.980
So what do we make of that?

34:58.980 --> 35:03.900
Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being women or having sex as women or arousal

35:03.900 --> 35:08.980
during cross-dressing, are what the trans community has de-stigmatizingly termed cross-sex

35:08.980 --> 35:10.300
gender fantasy.

35:10.300 --> 35:14.900
And among trans women, particularly prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty

35:14.900 --> 35:15.900
common.

35:15.900 --> 35:20.260
You'll see it all over the place on trans subreddits, there's a blog called Cross Dreamers

35:20.260 --> 35:24.340
devoted to it, it's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Julia Serrano.

35:24.340 --> 35:27.220
So within the trans community, this isn't even controversial.

35:27.220 --> 35:30.260
It's not provocative, it's not politically incorrect.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.180
But how do we make sense of this?

35:32.260 --> 35:36.580
Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience genuine female sexuality when

35:36.580 --> 35:40.820
you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system, so you've gotta get that

35:40.820 --> 35:44.060
out and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away.

35:44.060 --> 35:47.540
But how is this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia?

35:47.540 --> 35:49.460
Well basically it comes down to this.

35:49.460 --> 35:55.140
Blanchard's theory claims that cross-sex gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential.

35:55.140 --> 35:59.660
In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic transsexual, you are essentially male, and

35:59.660 --> 36:04.740
any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be honestly understood as the expression

36:04.740 --> 36:07.060
of an essentially male sexual urge.

36:07.060 --> 36:11.380
I reject the idea that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence

36:11.380 --> 36:16.140
that it isn't essential is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic

36:16.140 --> 36:21.460
admit that after transition, the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes, yet they continue

36:21.460 --> 36:23.860
to prefer living as trans women.

36:23.860 --> 36:26.300
Blanchard made this observation himself.

36:26.300 --> 36:30.620
Any viable theory relating to the etiologies of autogynephilia and transsexualism must

36:30.620 --> 36:33.060
explain the following well-established observation.

36:33.060 --> 36:37.420
Gender dysphoria in young non-homosexual males usually appears along with or subsequent to

36:37.420 --> 36:38.900
autogynephilia.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.900
In later years, however, autogynephilic sexual arousal may diminish or disappear, while the

36:42.900 --> 36:45.620
transsexual wish remains or grows even stronger.

36:45.620 --> 36:49.420
The same conclusion is suggested by the fact that surgical castration and estrogen treatment,

36:49.420 --> 36:53.020
which decrease libido and gender dysphorics, as in other men, usually have no effect on

36:53.020 --> 36:56.140
the desire to live as female or the resolve to remain in that role.

36:56.140 --> 37:00.380
If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women,

37:00.380 --> 37:05.020
why would they continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away?

37:05.020 --> 37:07.820
Well, this is where things get really weird.

37:07.820 --> 37:12.060
According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to shift the goalpost

37:12.060 --> 37:17.380
and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all, it's actually a sexual

37:17.380 --> 37:18.700
orientation.

37:18.700 --> 37:22.980
So what happens when you transition is you actually pair-bond with yourself, forming

37:22.980 --> 37:26.900
a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've become.

37:26.900 --> 37:31.300
And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.700
A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people.

37:34.700 --> 37:38.420
Are you saying that trans women are a man and a woman inside the...

37:38.420 --> 37:41.100
Why do they continue falling in love with other people and...

37:41.100 --> 37:42.100
I can't even start with this.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.940
This video is too long, I'm getting cranky.

37:43.940 --> 37:47.580
Look, this seems like the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory.

37:47.580 --> 37:52.540
Like okay, maybe I subconsciously created a female alter-ego with which my original

37:52.540 --> 37:54.460
male ego has fallen in love.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.260
But maybe lots of things.

37:56.260 --> 38:00.040
Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father.

38:00.040 --> 38:04.380
Maybe the Elder Gods ripped my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for

38:04.380 --> 38:05.700
my female half.

38:05.700 --> 38:09.220
Or maybe I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.220
11.

38:12.220 --> 38:13.780
True Autogynephiles

38:13.780 --> 38:18.120
Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts

38:18.120 --> 38:22.800
of trans women whose primary sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does

38:22.800 --> 38:24.600
appear to be genuinely autogynephilic.

38:24.600 --> 38:29.080
And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences, because that

38:29.080 --> 38:31.760
would be a terrible thing to do.

38:31.760 --> 38:36.080
Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about judging people, so I'm not gonna say

38:36.080 --> 38:37.800
that these people aren't really trans.

38:37.800 --> 38:42.720
I mean, I find it weird and hard to imagine, but whatever.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.400
I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.320
And wait till you see my sex robot.

38:47.320 --> 38:51.080
And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings, I would just tell you.

38:51.080 --> 38:55.440
I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own diary on my deathbed.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.960
But I just don't.

38:56.960 --> 39:01.240
This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations to transition, and that's ultimately

39:01.240 --> 39:05.840
the reason most trans women hate this theory, not because of wounded narcissism or shattered

39:05.840 --> 39:09.560
erotic delusions, we just don't like being misrepresented.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.360
But you know who does love this theory?

39:13.360 --> 39:15.400
She's been there literally the whole time.

39:15.440 --> 39:19.320
You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless

39:19.320 --> 39:23.760
psychoanalysis, whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at

39:23.760 --> 39:29.240
me for even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.240
So you know what?

39:30.240 --> 39:32.520
Why don't we just get that out of the way right now?

39:32.520 --> 39:35.080
It's time to put this tranny on trial.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.080
12.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.680
The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
All rise.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.400
The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.760
Judge Bailey presiding.

39:46.760 --> 39:50.480
Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus ContraPoints.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.920
Are both sides ready?

39:53.920 --> 39:57.840
District Attorney Cockbain, ready for the subreddit, your honor?

39:57.840 --> 39:59.200
Ready I guess.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.080
Your honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man.

40:03.080 --> 40:07.520
A full-grown, six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.280
It's really more of a hospital gown?

40:09.280 --> 40:14.040
The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert roleplaying

40:14.040 --> 40:16.840
as such for his own twisted sexual amusement.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
Abigail, what are you holding?

40:18.840 --> 40:20.680
It's for horseback riding.

40:20.680 --> 40:25.280
Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip, uploaded to YouTube

40:25.280 --> 40:28.280
by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.280
Oh god.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.280
Fishnets.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
Garter belts.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.280
Corsets.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.920
If you're not the trappings of an autogynephile, then I don't have two X chromosomes.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
Agreed.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.760
Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

40:48.760 --> 40:52.240
Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?

40:52.240 --> 40:55.600
The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.680
I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.680
What?

40:58.680 --> 41:00.160
Rocky Horror Picture Show.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.240
I used to do Frankenfurter.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.560
Your honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.120
That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.600
This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.880
Are you a Rocky Horror fan, your honor?

41:11.880 --> 41:12.880
Am I?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.440
It's just a jump.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
To the left.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.160
And take a step to the right.

41:19.160 --> 41:20.160
Put your hands on your hips.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.160
And bring your knees in tight.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.160
But it's the pelvic thrust.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.160
Ew.

41:23.160 --> 41:30.680
So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.320
How is that helping your case at all?

41:32.320 --> 41:37.720
Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic, but when you're living as a man, there aren't

41:37.720 --> 41:41.480
a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.

41:41.480 --> 41:46.280
You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween, pretty much any time it's socially allowed

41:46.280 --> 41:47.880
to be a freakish monster.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.960
And come to think of it, the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
since the beginning of this channel.

41:53.960 --> 41:58.440
The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very, like, autogynephilia chic.

41:58.440 --> 42:02.880
I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.

42:02.880 --> 42:06.360
The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.520
And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.680
I thought I was just disgusting.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.960
Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster actually does capture something

42:14.960 --> 42:17.000
of the horror of gender dysphoria.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.560
And part of it is that identifying with the scary monster version of yourself is actually

42:21.560 --> 42:23.160
kind of empowering.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.440
Like cis feminists, you have your thing about witches.

42:26.440 --> 42:31.160
Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and

42:31.160 --> 42:32.160
corsets.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.160
This is just male fetishism.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.600
Well, it's true that cis women generally don't dress that way, no.

42:36.600 --> 42:40.400
I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually pretty popular.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.920
But I never wear shit like that anymore.

42:41.920 --> 42:46.920
In fact, it actually causes gender dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male crossdresser.

42:46.920 --> 42:50.400
Sometimes trans women start out with a fairly male conception of what women wear.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.840
I guess that's true.

42:51.840 --> 42:56.700
A lot of trans women transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a crossdresser

42:56.700 --> 42:58.120
or a drag queen.

42:58.120 --> 43:01.760
But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.080
Like, what did you wear when you were 14?

43:04.080 --> 43:06.080
Wake me up!

43:06.080 --> 43:08.080
Wake me up inside!

43:08.080 --> 43:09.080
Wake up!

43:09.760 --> 43:11.160
That's what I thought.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.960
But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?

43:14.960 --> 43:15.960
Cis women do.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.620
They have some good ideas.

43:17.620 --> 43:21.380
Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.400
And what would we do then, Abigail?

43:23.400 --> 43:24.400
What would we do then?

43:24.400 --> 43:25.680
I don't know what you would do.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.040
I think I could manage.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.160
Your honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.160
Is there a way to smash my ribs in?

43:33.160 --> 43:34.160
I'll smash them in.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.680
I'll smash the shit out of them.

43:36.680 --> 43:42.040
These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.160
Would you fuck me?

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
I wouldn't.

43:44.160 --> 43:49.560
Your honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and corsets in front of a mirror

43:49.560 --> 43:53.120
before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me?

43:53.120 --> 43:56.520
This, your honor, is peak trans.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.760
Peak trans.

43:58.760 --> 44:02.520
Peak trans.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.520
How do we even need to have a trial about this?

44:04.520 --> 44:08.760
Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish, not sexual pleasure.

44:08.760 --> 44:12.600
Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs, and is what is known

44:12.600 --> 44:14.880
in the trans community as a joke.

44:14.880 --> 44:20.040
The corsets, the high heels, these were primitive efforts at clawing my way out of manhood,

44:20.040 --> 44:21.840
and they're efforts that I've left behind.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.040
Now that I'm on female hormones and I live this way full time, I feel the way I'm supposed

44:26.040 --> 44:29.000
to feel, and I don't need to lean on that stuff for validation.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.640
I mean I still do some things that cis women don't do.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.320
I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done.

44:35.320 --> 44:40.320
I do it because I need to feel something, god, anything, taking up space on my chest.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.240
And feeling that reassures me enough that I can fall asleep.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.040
Not so I can look at myself in the mirror.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.360
Not so I can get off.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.080
So I can simply fall asleep.

44:48.080 --> 44:51.440
No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women.

44:51.440 --> 44:55.400
We have many experiences in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different.

44:55.400 --> 44:59.040
Yes, and you don't have the oppression experiences that cis women have.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.520
Well you know what, Abigail?

45:00.520 --> 45:01.520
You're right.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.120
For the most part, I don't.

45:03.120 --> 45:06.480
But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're just

45:06.480 --> 45:07.680
such a fucking asshole.

45:07.680 --> 45:12.040
And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression experiences, don't have

45:12.040 --> 45:15.680
this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.

45:15.680 --> 45:20.360
Go find someone who transitioned decades ago and talk to them about their experiences as women.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.600
Your honor, the defendant does not bleed.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.160
I find that pretty conclusive.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.160
As do I.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.160
Guilty as charged.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.280
13.

45:28.280 --> 45:29.280
Final Thoughts

45:29.320 --> 45:33.800
I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.120
Some of them will say things like,

45:35.120 --> 45:39.800
Why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences as you?

45:39.800 --> 45:43.960
Well I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to think

45:43.960 --> 45:47.840
a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this.

45:47.840 --> 45:52.360
It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis

45:52.360 --> 45:56.360
of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.720
I've had to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that

46:00.720 --> 46:05.600
people will never take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness.

46:05.600 --> 46:08.880
For trans women, this debate is intensely personal and risky.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.040
Our lives and happiness are at stake.

46:11.040 --> 46:15.800
Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral, devoted pursuers of scientific truth.

46:15.800 --> 46:20.600
They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and cruel toward trans people, and they've

46:20.600 --> 46:24.920
misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent and humiliate us.

46:24.920 --> 46:28.960
No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.

46:28.960 --> 46:33.640
I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity, but I am at

46:33.640 --> 46:38.120
core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself.

46:38.120 --> 46:42.400
So I have to hope, for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by

46:42.400 --> 46:44.720
someone who thinks of me as a woman.

46:44.720 --> 46:47.240
Otherwise, I'm fucked.

46:47.240 --> 46:48.800
This has been a rough one, girls.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.120
I dare say you've earned a song.

46:51.120 --> 47:03.120
Thanks for the times that you've given me.

47:03.120 --> 47:12.120
The memories are all on my mind.

47:13.120 --> 47:27.120
Now that we've come to the end of our rainbow, there's something I must say out loud.

47:27.120 --> 47:52.120
You're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do.

47:52.120 --> 48:20.120
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady, and I love you, yes I do, and I love you.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.120
One more time.

48:23.120 --> 48:26.120
And just a step to the right.

48:26.120 --> 48:29.120
Put your hands on your hips.

48:29.120 --> 48:32.120
And bring your knees in tight.

48:32.120 --> 48:39.120
It's just a pelvic thrust that really drives me insane.

48:39.120 --> 48:45.120
Let's do the time warp again.

48:45.120 --> 48:51.120
Let's do the time warp again.
