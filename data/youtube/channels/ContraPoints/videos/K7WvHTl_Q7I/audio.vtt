00:00.000 --> 00:18.960
All right children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.280
How do I put this delicately?

00:21.280 --> 00:24.400
Your humble hostess is a total les.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.760
Shame.

00:26.760 --> 00:31.440
You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is,

00:31.440 --> 00:35.080
but oh, it's so much worse than just that.

00:35.080 --> 00:41.440
You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness,

00:41.440 --> 00:45.120
and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.400
And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
gay.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.440
Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.680
So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself

00:59.680 --> 01:04.880
in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key lesbicious behavior.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.840
And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.760
So story time, I fell in love with my best friend.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.060
Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.

01:13.060 --> 01:17.720
Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is

01:17.720 --> 01:18.720
piping hot.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.080
For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.560
I'm a super fucking bi.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.840
But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into

01:29.840 --> 01:31.280
the straight lifestyle.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.800
This really started in 2018, by that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was

01:36.800 --> 01:39.680
a fully heterosexual woman.

01:39.680 --> 01:44.520
And we're gonna circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
of things.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
I'm like an epic poet.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
Hail Muse.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.920
Hey how are you, gorge?

01:49.920 --> 01:54.400
So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I'd even say best friends, with a

01:54.400 --> 02:00.400
woman whomp-style called Joanne.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.400
Light of my life.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.200
Can we get some melodramatic music please?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.600
Yeah, here we go.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.680
You're gonna want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.360
I want you to fully enjoy my pain.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.400
So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.560
It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and

02:16.560 --> 02:20.680
in-jokes, and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.760
We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.040
And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first

02:27.040 --> 02:32.480
20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because I am a weird, and I don't get along

02:32.480 --> 02:33.960
that well with that many people.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.040
One reason we got so emotionally close is, we're both trans.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.200
And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with

02:41.200 --> 02:44.600
another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.480
Oh and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did

02:51.480 --> 02:53.440
notice every time I looked at her.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.320
And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
platonic either.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.760
We'd get drunk and make out, we'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle, straight girls

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760
do that right?

03:04.760 --> 03:05.760
Gal pals!

03:05.760 --> 03:11.080
I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,

03:11.080 --> 03:15.960
and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand and

03:15.960 --> 03:18.160
we walked down the street together holding hands.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.560
This is garbage and I want to die, I hope you all know that I'm in agony.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.360
Later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink, we'd

03:27.360 --> 03:30.840
run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.840
Ah!

03:31.840 --> 03:35.040
It's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.640
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.800
A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.320
They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.200
Gal pals!

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Just kill me.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.600
Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before

03:53.600 --> 03:55.720
the kids get home and they won't notice.

03:55.720 --> 04:00.920
So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne

04:00.920 --> 04:04.020
or to myself that I was falling in love.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.740
So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time I had

04:08.740 --> 04:12.940
basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.860
So how could I possibly think that?

04:14.860 --> 04:17.860
Well, the short answer is shame.

04:17.860 --> 04:20.180
Why is no one talking about the shame?

04:20.180 --> 04:23.460
I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.380
There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.

04:26.380 --> 04:32.260
Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.

04:32.260 --> 04:37.020
There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription

04:37.020 --> 04:39.940
Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.

04:39.940 --> 04:42.060
I'm a bronze star lesbian.

04:42.060 --> 04:46.380
Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.380
Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.580
I tried prayer.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.380
I tried electric shocks.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.620
All the classics.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.620
All the hits.

04:53.620 --> 04:57.500
You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start

04:57.500 --> 04:59.120
to associate the two in your head.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.560
So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.

05:01.560 --> 05:07.600
This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.160
So at some point, the shame was just too much for me.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.320
And it literally broke my brain.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.840
I no longer wanted to be straight, I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
Maybe a little bi.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
A little bit.

05:19.840 --> 05:25.000
By that time, I had started dating men, and I got into a serious long-term relationship

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
with a man.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.920
At first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself, female friendships

05:29.920 --> 05:31.320
are just really intense.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.160
That's probably why I feel so strongly.

05:34.160 --> 05:39.040
And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I'd notice that.

05:39.040 --> 05:44.600
And you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.480
So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.400
And then two things happened.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.400
First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.240
Fuck my drag, right?

06:00.240 --> 06:05.240
I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested

06:05.240 --> 06:10.240
denial and bi-phobia allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as, I just have a

06:10.240 --> 06:11.920
thing for my straight best friend.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.920
Like who doesn't?

06:12.920 --> 06:17.080
But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside

06:17.080 --> 06:22.360
the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.840
Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just, she's just not that

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
into women.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.200
But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.800
And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.000
Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.400
It was a long distance friendship.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.480
And about halfway through that visit, I cracked.

06:43.480 --> 06:50.080
One morning, I woke up next to her, gal pals, and I looked at her pretty fucking face, and

06:50.080 --> 06:54.760
I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

06:54.760 --> 07:00.480
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio-girl to have about

07:00.480 --> 07:01.640
her gal pal.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.840
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.680
Like what the fuck is this?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.760
What am I feeling?

07:08.760 --> 07:14.040
I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th

07:14.040 --> 07:15.840
century Italian opera.

07:15.840 --> 07:23.280
So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong, devastating.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.560
She did not reciprocate my feelings.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.560
Nurse!

07:26.560 --> 07:29.280
My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!

07:29.280 --> 07:32.960
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah, I'm

07:32.960 --> 07:34.480
sure we all know how that goes.

07:34.480 --> 07:39.080
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three month friendship break right then and there,

07:39.080 --> 07:40.400
I might have recovered.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.460
But we couldn't keep away from each other.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.820
She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me, because the

07:46.820 --> 07:49.620
truth is, we were never just gal pals.

07:49.620 --> 07:54.800
And I was beyond reason, like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple

07:54.800 --> 07:57.740
joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got.

07:57.740 --> 07:58.740
Those are great by the way.

07:58.740 --> 07:59.940
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

07:59.940 --> 08:04.820
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just

08:04.820 --> 08:07.860
repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.340
Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year,

08:12.340 --> 08:16.300
because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.700
But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation

08:20.700 --> 08:21.700
worse.

08:21.700 --> 08:27.140
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got

08:27.140 --> 08:30.180
super fucking canceled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.180
Link in the description, subscribe!

08:32.180 --> 08:36.540
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was gonna have to be the one to enforce

08:36.540 --> 08:39.940
a friendship break, otherwise I was never gonna get over her.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.460
So there was this combination of things, being politically canceled by Twitter, being

08:43.460 --> 08:48.540
romantically canceled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend, which sent

08:48.540 --> 08:52.140
me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.340
And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.

08:57.340 --> 09:02.860
Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes

09:02.860 --> 09:04.860
feel outside yourself.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.180
And with that, comes a new perspective.

09:07.180 --> 09:11.740
So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day and binge-watching

09:11.740 --> 09:16.020
Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.700
And that gave me a new kind of clarity.

09:18.700 --> 09:23.340
I looked back on the last couple years, and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.

09:23.340 --> 09:30.900
So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a, uh, I am a gay.

09:30.900 --> 09:31.900
Not clickbait.

09:37.180 --> 09:56.860
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

09:56.860 --> 10:04.860
Shame.

10:04.860 --> 10:09.900
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.860
Well that's my Eden.

10:11.860 --> 10:12.860
Candy flipping.

10:12.860 --> 10:13.860
I love it.

10:13.860 --> 10:18.580
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches

10:18.580 --> 10:19.860
of the straight agenda.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.160
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.140
First there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

10:27.140 --> 10:29.140
Female friendships are just really intense.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.900
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

10:30.940 --> 10:35.980
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic

10:35.980 --> 10:36.980
attraction to men.

10:36.980 --> 10:40.540
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.980
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame

10:44.980 --> 10:48.380
will overpower me again, and I'll slide back into denial.

10:48.380 --> 10:53.180
So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.

10:53.180 --> 10:57.660
Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis

10:57.660 --> 10:58.660
of my own personality.

10:58.660 --> 10:59.660
She's a Libra.

10:59.980 --> 11:02.860
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

11:02.860 --> 11:07.500
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that, like it makes you grow breasts,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.340
at least, in theory.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.780
I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.300
But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your

11:16.300 --> 11:17.300
sexuality.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.820
The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual, because

11:21.820 --> 11:24.580
the libido I had known before was just gone.

11:24.980 --> 11:30.740
But I'm very much not asexual, it just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically

11:30.740 --> 11:33.060
female sex drive.

11:33.060 --> 11:38.420
One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.

11:38.420 --> 11:43.820
Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way, it sparks my interest,

11:43.820 --> 11:45.860
but it doesn't light my fire.

11:45.860 --> 11:49.420
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.340
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

11:52.340 --> 11:57.900
Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about, but I think

11:57.900 --> 12:00.300
the concept it describes applies to me.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.900
Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

12:03.900 --> 12:08.340
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them

12:08.340 --> 12:09.340
as a friend.

12:09.340 --> 12:12.740
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

12:12.740 --> 12:16.780
Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay-married?

12:16.780 --> 12:19.140
I know that's not how it works.

12:19.140 --> 12:20.420
I have to play the field.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.300
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.700
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.700
It's boring.

12:28.700 --> 12:33.500
The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and

12:33.500 --> 12:34.500
shame.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.340
I shouldn't, but I want to.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.940
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

12:38.940 --> 12:44.140
I'm also guessing this kind of slow-burn sexuality is more common in women than men.

12:44.140 --> 12:48.820
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age

12:48.820 --> 12:49.820
than gay women.

12:50.220 --> 12:54.540
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about

12:54.540 --> 12:58.740
who you're attracted to, whereas there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're

12:58.740 --> 13:01.420
gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.

13:01.420 --> 13:05.460
And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

13:05.460 --> 13:10.500
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality, because I do feel

13:10.500 --> 13:15.180
aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender, and that can be pretty intense

13:15.180 --> 13:16.180
in its own right.

13:16.180 --> 13:22.260
I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating

13:22.260 --> 13:27.860
to me than looking at a beautiful man, which can be moving in its own way, but it's more

13:27.860 --> 13:31.980
like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.

13:31.980 --> 13:36.300
You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.620
That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean I'd fuck the Parthenon.

13:39.620 --> 13:40.620
I'd fuck it so hard.

13:40.740 --> 13:46.380
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity, and maybe that stems from

13:46.380 --> 13:51.940
my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

13:51.940 --> 13:59.180
There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.

13:59.180 --> 14:07.180
Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms enfolding my

14:07.180 --> 14:09.900
smooth, fragile body.

14:10.540 --> 14:16.020
Or maybe it's more Freudian, the masculine man as daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic

14:16.020 --> 14:19.780
power of the phallus, penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

14:19.780 --> 14:24.940
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy

14:24.940 --> 14:30.060
man and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do

14:30.060 --> 14:31.060
things to me.

14:31.060 --> 14:36.900
And I can find things I like about male bodies, like they're very warm.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.180
I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.020
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head, and she says,

14:43.020 --> 14:45.740
but are you attracted to men?

14:45.740 --> 14:48.100
Or do you just like being warm?

14:48.100 --> 14:49.980
My attraction to women is very different.

14:49.980 --> 14:56.820
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.380
This is going to destroy me.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.620
You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.

15:01.620 --> 15:06.020
I've never once been in pain over male beauty, but around Joanne, once I was open about my

15:06.020 --> 15:10.060
feelings and things got bad, there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be

15:10.060 --> 15:14.060
like, don't even enter my line of sight right now, you're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

15:14.060 --> 15:18.460
There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.260
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

15:20.260 --> 15:25.220
And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

15:25.220 --> 15:28.420
I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.

15:28.420 --> 15:33.460
It's that they're interested in me, and that's pretty interesting.

15:33.500 --> 15:38.540
I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

15:38.540 --> 15:44.460
You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.500
Fuck me up, king.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.740
God, that's hot.

15:46.740 --> 15:48.220
Gets me every time.

15:48.220 --> 15:53.700
But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,

15:53.700 --> 15:57.580
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

15:57.580 --> 16:03.020
You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.

16:03.020 --> 16:05.780
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

16:05.780 --> 16:11.060
And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women

16:11.060 --> 16:17.420
is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.

16:17.420 --> 16:22.140
It's all very passive, and in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

16:22.140 --> 16:24.500
I've taken a very submissive role.

16:24.500 --> 16:29.180
Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let him do things to me.

16:29.180 --> 16:34.620
And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.860
I like that feeling myself, and I do genuinely enjoy

16:37.860 --> 16:40.300
taking on a more submissive role sometimes.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.340
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

16:42.340 --> 16:47.740
Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid

16:47.740 --> 16:50.700
confronting what your desires actually are.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.580
It's freedom from freedom.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.780
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,

16:54.780 --> 16:56.980
and ashamed of your transsexual body,

16:56.980 --> 16:59.900
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

16:59.900 --> 17:03.380
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

17:03.380 --> 17:06.460
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

17:06.460 --> 17:08.780
by letting someone else take control

17:08.780 --> 17:11.900
can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.060
And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.980
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

17:17.980 --> 17:21.660
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

17:21.660 --> 17:23.700
isn't really that much more liberated.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.380
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago,

17:26.380 --> 17:28.980
and totally identified with the fantasy.

17:28.980 --> 17:31.420
And later, I thought that was evidence

17:31.420 --> 17:34.020
I had normative female desires.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.580
Never mind that I was identifying

17:35.580 --> 17:37.420
with the midlife crisis fantasies

17:37.420 --> 17:39.060
of a repressed English housewife

17:39.060 --> 17:42.060
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.700
I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy

17:44.700 --> 17:46.860
a healthier version of that fantasy.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.820
I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer

17:48.820 --> 17:51.020
under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.260
But what makes me different is that for me,

17:53.260 --> 17:56.380
submission to a man was simply the only way

17:56.380 --> 17:58.220
I could enjoy sex without shame.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.420
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

18:00.420 --> 18:03.780
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

18:03.780 --> 18:07.100
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

18:07.100 --> 18:10.780
straight women are ultimately attracted to men

18:10.780 --> 18:12.580
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

18:12.580 --> 18:13.780
Or are they?

18:13.780 --> 18:15.180
Gay men certainly are,

18:15.180 --> 18:18.020
and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

18:18.020 --> 18:21.180
But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh

18:21.180 --> 18:23.220
about male bodies and men in general.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.100
Which, what is that about?

18:26.100 --> 18:29.940
I just, I just do not understand straight women.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.540
I don't think I ever will, and that's okay.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.540
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment

18:34.540 --> 18:36.360
and move on with my lesbian life.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.380
Now, what I've been giving you so far

18:39.380 --> 18:41.500
is a retrospective analysis,

18:41.500 --> 18:45.300
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.340
But you have to understand

18:46.340 --> 18:48.060
that when I was living through this,

18:48.060 --> 18:49.820
I experienced it very differently

18:49.820 --> 18:51.860
because I didn't have these insights.

18:51.860 --> 18:54.660
So I wasn't thinking, oh, I'm not really attracted to men,

18:54.660 --> 18:57.140
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

18:57.140 --> 18:59.500
so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself

18:59.500 --> 19:01.700
from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.

19:01.700 --> 19:05.740
No, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,

19:05.740 --> 19:08.220
at least until Joanne ruined my life.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.500
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

19:10.500 --> 19:13.980
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

19:13.980 --> 19:17.420
I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half

19:17.420 --> 19:19.900
who I had very genuine feelings for.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.060
Plot twist, story time.

19:22.060 --> 19:27.060
So my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.

19:27.620 --> 19:32.240
Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga-Chad fantasy.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.980
You know, he was very masculine,

19:33.980 --> 19:37.620
taller than me, objectively attractive, very charming.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.380
Straight women used to tell me all the time

19:39.380 --> 19:41.100
they were jealous of me for being with him,

19:41.100 --> 19:43.060
and obviously I loved that.

19:43.060 --> 19:47.220
To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,

19:47.220 --> 19:49.980
a sort of archetypal romantic elite

19:49.980 --> 19:53.740
who swept me off my feet and fulfilled my sick fantasies

19:53.740 --> 19:55.460
of being a heterosexual woman.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.020
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say

19:57.020 --> 19:59.740
that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

19:59.740 --> 20:02.320
but that once it came to actually dating,

20:02.320 --> 20:03.780
I realized I didn't like it.

20:03.780 --> 20:06.300
But honestly, it's more complicated than that.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.860
Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him,

20:09.860 --> 20:11.700
and I still think of him as the one

20:11.700 --> 20:13.980
genuine boy crush of my life.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.740
When we started dating, it was really exciting.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.260
I'd never had a boyfriend before,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.300
and he'd never been with a trans woman before,

20:20.300 --> 20:21.820
and we had this, like,

20:21.820 --> 20:24.280
adorably heterosexual energy together,

20:24.280 --> 20:26.460
like holding hands in the park.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.460
It was cute.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.460
This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a Cad.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.600
But he wasn't.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.440
He was great.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.820
He took very good care of me.

20:33.820 --> 20:36.420
He was never ashamed to be seen with me,

20:36.420 --> 20:39.260
or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,

20:39.260 --> 20:43.260
which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.

20:43.260 --> 20:46.720
He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself,

20:47.560 --> 20:50.440
and when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed,

20:50.440 --> 20:53.040
and that meant a lot.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.200
So I really wanted this to work.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.200
Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.260
And for a year or so, I thought it was working.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.080
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.280
I missed him when he was gone.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.520
I told him I loved him, and I meant it.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.360
But what happened is, by the end of the first year,

21:11.360 --> 21:14.200
the initial excitement had died down,

21:14.200 --> 21:15.720
and while Chad was ready

21:15.720 --> 21:18.160
to keep escalating the relationship,

21:18.160 --> 21:22.480
I was realizing that something was very seriously,

21:22.480 --> 21:24.480
emotionally wrong on my end.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.760
There was something missing.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.180
And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,

21:29.180 --> 21:32.000
I was like, there's that missing feeling.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.200
And I started to understand what my problem was.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.120
Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram

21:39.120 --> 21:41.600
an aloof picture of me with the caption,

21:41.680 --> 21:45.080
do I actually like men, or do I just like attention?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.840
And I didn't mean anything serious by that,

21:46.840 --> 21:48.440
I was just joking around.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.960
You know, you can post something like that,

21:49.960 --> 21:51.920
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

21:51.920 --> 21:53.540
yeah, fuck men.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.120
What is their damage?

21:56.120 --> 21:58.280
Well, they're stuck dating men, that's their damage.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.360
But a few people left comments saying,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.560
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.400
You should make a video about comphet.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.200
And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?

22:07.200 --> 22:10.640
So I Googled it, and I learned that comphet is short

22:10.640 --> 22:12.720
for compulsory heterosexuality.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.320
Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality

22:15.320 --> 22:17.560
is socially required of women,

22:17.560 --> 22:20.120
and it's so bound up with the conventional idea

22:20.120 --> 22:22.520
of what it even means to be a woman,

22:22.520 --> 22:26.440
that gay women often mistakenly believe for years

22:26.440 --> 22:27.920
that they're attracted to men.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.560
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post

22:30.560 --> 22:33.120
called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

22:33.120 --> 22:35.320
And I'm reading through this post like,

22:35.320 --> 22:39.240
oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.680
Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head

22:42.680 --> 22:44.720
that says I must really be het,

22:44.720 --> 22:46.760
even when I'm in love with a woman.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.280
Quote, you have every reason to be happy

22:49.280 --> 22:52.520
in your relationship with a man, but you just aren't.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.040
Everything is going really well,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.800
but something is missing and you can't figure out what.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.000
So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.320
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes

23:02.320 --> 23:04.580
that were clearly designed for 13-year-olds.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.040
And I'm fully a 31-year-old transsexual

23:07.040 --> 23:10.560
taking this quiz like, it's true, Samantha was right,

23:10.560 --> 23:12.120
I am a total les.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.080
All the cis gay people watching this video

23:14.080 --> 23:15.800
probably wanna kill me right now,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.880
cause y'all figured this shit out in high school

23:17.880 --> 23:20.200
and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

23:20.200 --> 23:22.960
it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.960
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay

23:24.960 --> 23:27.040
for 30 minutes of my lifetime please?

23:27.040 --> 23:29.240
Is it all right with you, the gays?

23:29.240 --> 23:32.000
So to be honest, I still experience

23:32.000 --> 23:33.760
comphet thoughts and fantasies.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.640
Like for a long time, I've had what seemed

23:35.640 --> 23:38.760
to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.200
But after a lot of introspection,

23:40.200 --> 23:43.880
I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

23:43.880 --> 23:46.480
of private happiness and fulfillment.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.680
It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.360
Like can you imagine if I got married

23:53.360 --> 23:57.720
to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding

23:57.720 --> 24:01.040
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.360
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.200
I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.520
But I don't actually wanna be married.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.000
I wanna get married.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.360
I wanna have a wedding.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.080
Basically, I wanna wear a wedding dress.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.680
I want attention, okay?

24:14.680 --> 24:16.880
Please, pay attention to me.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.360
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,

24:19.360 --> 24:22.400
but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.120
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality

24:26.120 --> 24:29.280
because there's a level of gender instability

24:29.280 --> 24:32.440
and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.320
And until recently, I wasn't secure enough

24:35.320 --> 24:37.320
in my gender to handle that.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.520
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

24:40.520 --> 24:42.040
and I think I needed to go through

24:42.040 --> 24:44.320
the more one-on-one straight girl experience

24:44.320 --> 24:46.920
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.160
I still have a hard time imagining

24:49.160 --> 24:52.900
a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.640
And I think that's partly because

24:54.640 --> 24:58.160
good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.800
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama

25:00.800 --> 25:03.920
from 15 years ago, which I do like,

25:03.920 --> 25:05.280
and I like the new one too.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.800
But after that, the runner-up is,

25:07.800 --> 25:11.320
I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.520
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whomst we ship.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.400
Well, I don't ship them,

25:15.400 --> 25:18.360
because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush

25:18.360 --> 25:19.680
on Katya Zamolodchikova.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.680
Don't laugh at me.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.840
She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.440
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.760
Sure, some haters and losers will probably try

25:27.760 --> 25:30.360
to convince me that Katya is in fact a homosexual man

25:30.360 --> 25:32.320
posing as a woman, but you know what?

25:32.320 --> 25:34.800
This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.660
and I don't need this right now.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.920
I need to be touched by a real woman.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.800
I'm losing my goddamn mind.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.440
It's so deeply embedded in our culture

25:45.440 --> 25:48.520
that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.960
And it's not just Disney movies.

25:49.960 --> 25:54.200
Like, it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology,

25:54.200 --> 25:56.600
German fairy tales, Victorian novels.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.220
The whole weight of cultural history is telling you

25:59.220 --> 26:02.580
that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.620
And if you're already super dysphoric

26:04.620 --> 26:06.900
and insecure about your gender,

26:06.900 --> 26:09.180
then to reject that possibility,

26:09.180 --> 26:11.820
ah, it hurts, it hurts so bad.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.420
But whenever I think about having a long-term partner,

26:14.420 --> 26:16.060
you know, not the wedding day,

26:16.060 --> 26:18.800
but the 1,000th morning waking up together,

26:20.100 --> 26:22.400
I can only imagine her being a woman.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.700
My brain wants a good man to take care of me,

26:25.700 --> 26:28.900
but my heart wants a high-maintenance diva

26:28.980 --> 26:30.020
to ruin my life.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.820
And once I knew that for sure,

26:33.220 --> 26:35.620
I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.020
And this man was like my hinge.

26:38.020 --> 26:40.100
He was holding me together.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.420
But last December,

26:43.840 --> 26:47.860
I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian,

26:47.860 --> 26:51.420
which at least is a good reason.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.780
I'm having a hard time, you guys.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.500
Leave your pity in the comments.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.420
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.400
I feel like shit.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.220
I think that's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me.

27:04.220 --> 27:06.860
Like, I could really use a couple Advil and a vodka tonic.

27:06.860 --> 27:09.140
I think I might throw some clothes on, too.

27:09.140 --> 27:10.940
Where's that snake?

27:10.940 --> 27:11.780
Mm.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.820
I already miss my heterosexual nails.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.100
I know these are too long to be gay,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.620
but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.940
Getting my acrylics removed, traumatizing.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.260
I feel like I'm detransitioning.

27:30.260 --> 27:32.420
One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure

27:32.420 --> 27:34.140
with acrylics on eight fingers.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.340
I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon

27:36.340 --> 27:39.460
and say, hi, I'm a homosexual, please.

27:39.460 --> 27:42.480
I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.

27:44.060 --> 27:44.980
Shame.

27:44.980 --> 27:46.220
Let's talk about the shame.

27:46.220 --> 27:50.260
Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women,

27:50.260 --> 27:53.780
though two of those women later turned out to be trans,

27:53.780 --> 27:56.300
so I guess we had some way of finding each other.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.300
An attraction to women was never really a problem for me

27:59.300 --> 28:00.540
before the transgendering,

28:00.540 --> 28:03.300
because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle

28:03.300 --> 28:05.860
where men are supposed to be attracted to women.

28:05.860 --> 28:06.900
Crazy, I know.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.980
Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty?

28:10.980 --> 28:14.380
I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.820
And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around

28:16.820 --> 28:19.900
my being, at the time, a gender nonconforming man,

28:19.900 --> 28:21.580
which, in my early YouTube videos,

28:21.580 --> 28:24.240
I dealt with by caricaturing myself

28:24.280 --> 28:27.880
and basically leaning into the public humiliation,

28:27.880 --> 28:29.600
one of my classic techniques.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.320
But now, my shame is centered around my failure

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
to be a socially acceptable woman,

28:34.320 --> 28:36.920
and the most glaring aspects of that failure

28:36.920 --> 28:40.960
are my male past, my sexual orientation,

28:40.960 --> 28:44.480
and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.680
Yeah, killing all those people

28:45.680 --> 28:47.560
was not my most feminine moment,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.280
but I was having a bad skin day.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.440
What was I supposed to do?

28:51.440 --> 28:54.240
So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.520
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.920
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.340
And whatever one times two is,

29:02.340 --> 29:06.720
I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.560
Ugh.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.840
And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings

29:11.840 --> 29:16.120
because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.160
Why is no one talking about the shame?

29:18.160 --> 29:20.560
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.600
But we shouldn't be.

29:21.600 --> 29:24.680
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.480
I grew up in a media era when trans women

29:27.480 --> 29:30.680
were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities

29:30.680 --> 29:32.040
who deserve the violence they bring

29:32.040 --> 29:33.560
upon themselves by existing.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.360
And I started my transition in the first year

29:35.360 --> 29:36.640
of the Trump administration,

29:36.640 --> 29:38.840
when there's been constant vilification

29:38.840 --> 29:40.240
of trans people in the press.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.680
Invading women's bathrooms,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.760
forcing our insanity on children,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.680
destroying Western civilization

29:45.680 --> 29:47.460
with our authoritarian pronouns.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.620
It's hard to express just the daily humiliation

29:50.620 --> 29:52.700
of being a trans woman under these conditions.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.580
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,

29:54.580 --> 29:57.540
like my laser technician recently told me,

29:57.540 --> 29:59.660
you must be very courageous to transition

29:59.660 --> 30:02.660
because that is not socially acceptable.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.700
And then she went back to blasting laser beams

30:04.700 --> 30:05.580
into my asshole.

30:05.580 --> 30:08.100
And then there's the internet where, you know,

30:08.100 --> 30:10.860
I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.

30:10.860 --> 30:12.820
And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet

30:12.820 --> 30:14.860
are a wretched, wretched horde

30:14.860 --> 30:16.660
of bigoted attack helicopters.

30:16.660 --> 30:17.820
The whole point of this channel

30:17.820 --> 30:19.980
is I try to talk sense to these people.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.100
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives,

30:22.100 --> 30:24.100
and I try to empathize with their point of view

30:24.100 --> 30:25.900
and provide a rational response.

30:25.900 --> 30:28.060
But a side effect of all that research

30:28.060 --> 30:31.260
is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing.

30:31.260 --> 30:34.460
It's seeped into my brain and become a part of me.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.740
And this lifelong buildup of shame

30:36.740 --> 30:40.100
has become a wound at the heart of my existence.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.540
And all I can really do about it

30:41.540 --> 30:44.980
is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

30:44.980 --> 30:48.780
I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.580
I am resplendent trash.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.340
I am couture trash.

30:52.340 --> 30:56.620
And I just bought a mid-century gold-trimmed

30:56.620 --> 30:58.940
Venetian blown glass decanter,

30:58.940 --> 31:01.580
which helps me forget the shame and self-loathing

31:01.580 --> 31:03.220
that plagues my every moment.

31:03.220 --> 31:06.220
Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused

31:06.220 --> 31:08.660
about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

31:08.660 --> 31:10.600
when I've already come out as trans,

31:10.600 --> 31:12.260
which seems like a bigger deal.

31:12.260 --> 31:14.820
To paraphrase what some people have told me,

31:15.660 --> 31:17.580
you're already a transgendered, and a freak's a freak,

31:17.580 --> 31:19.300
so who cares what kind of freak?

31:19.300 --> 31:22.060
Well, first of all, I would like to propose

31:22.060 --> 31:23.620
a sociological theory.

31:23.620 --> 31:27.780
Tiffany's Law, all freaks have a deep psychological need

31:27.780 --> 31:30.340
to feel superior to a different type of freak.

31:30.340 --> 31:32.900
And trans lesbians are pretty close

31:32.900 --> 31:34.580
to the bottom of that pecking order.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.640
Who's even left for me to feel superior to,

31:36.640 --> 31:38.100
the goddamn Belgians?

31:38.100 --> 31:39.940
Fuck this waffle.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.900
Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me

31:42.940 --> 31:45.660
because I did it incrementally over like eight years.

31:45.660 --> 31:46.900
At first I was like, well,

31:46.900 --> 31:49.260
I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.

31:49.260 --> 31:52.260
Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup,

31:52.260 --> 31:55.260
I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.

31:55.260 --> 31:56.820
And then I realized I'm not a man at all,

31:56.820 --> 31:58.700
and I identified as non-binary.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.580
Then I started taking hormones.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.940
In two months on HRT, I woke up one day and said,

32:02.940 --> 32:05.780
it's fine, I am literally a woman.

32:05.780 --> 32:08.620
So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman,

32:08.620 --> 32:12.060
that was actually a step up in terms of social acceptability

32:12.100 --> 32:13.340
from where I was before.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.220
When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,

32:15.220 --> 32:16.900
I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.980
Whereas when I started transitioning to female,

32:19.980 --> 32:22.460
even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,

32:22.460 --> 32:25.100
there was at least a goal in mind,

32:25.100 --> 32:27.300
some possible future where I could lead

32:27.300 --> 32:29.420
a normal-ish life as a woman.

32:29.420 --> 32:31.820
So the moment I started identifying as a woman

32:31.820 --> 32:34.180
was the moment the comphet voice entered my head.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.420
Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before,

32:36.420 --> 32:38.740
but maybe I'm attracted to them now.

32:38.740 --> 32:39.740
I'm a woman, right?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.340
I've always been a little bi-curious,

32:41.340 --> 32:43.940
and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.580
Maybe I can make this work.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.460
Let's choose some boys to be attracted to

32:47.460 --> 32:49.040
and get started on this.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.420
Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.320
My way of explaining it to myself was,

32:53.320 --> 32:55.780
I guess hormones just magically changed

32:55.780 --> 32:58.300
my sexual orientation to the socially acceptable one.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.580
That's super freaking crazy.

32:59.580 --> 33:02.460
Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.

33:02.460 --> 33:04.300
God, there's so much pressure on trans women

33:04.300 --> 33:06.420
to be extremely gender-conforming,

33:06.420 --> 33:08.860
and even more so if you're a representative

33:08.860 --> 33:09.860
of the community.

33:09.860 --> 33:11.780
You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife

33:11.780 --> 33:14.420
or else cis people are gonna throw us all in camps.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.020
And early in my transition,

33:16.020 --> 33:18.180
I kind of worshiped straight trans women.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.980
Like, I looked up to them,

33:19.980 --> 33:21.700
and I wanted to be just like them.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.660
Now back then, there were a handful

33:23.660 --> 33:25.420
of trans lesbians on YouTube

33:25.420 --> 33:27.380
trying to make the case to the masses

33:27.380 --> 33:30.000
that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.620
But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.540
I watched those women get eaten alive.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.860
And as a result of my witnessing that

33:37.860 --> 33:40.340
at a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

33:40.340 --> 33:44.140
I internalized the message that a trans lesbian

33:44.140 --> 33:46.460
is just not an okay thing to be

33:46.460 --> 33:48.420
if you want to be tolerated or respected

33:48.420 --> 33:50.820
by anybody other than a handful of communists.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.740
So I began my transition with essentially no role model

33:53.740 --> 33:56.660
of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.900
And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia

33:59.900 --> 34:01.540
are harsher on gay trans women

34:01.540 --> 34:03.100
than they are on straight trans women.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.580
Like, take this trope that trans women are men

34:05.580 --> 34:08.220
who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.500
In response to that, it feels really good

34:10.500 --> 34:13.140
to be able to say, I'm not even attracted to women,

34:13.140 --> 34:15.340
I'm just a petite heterosexual bio girl,

34:15.340 --> 34:18.180
I'm surely not some kind of six foot monster

34:18.180 --> 34:19.900
who likes women.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.400
Shame.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.240
Shame.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.100
It does make me feel like a monster sometimes,

34:24.100 --> 34:26.420
like a mutant that has no place in society.

34:26.420 --> 34:29.300
And this shame has actually made it more difficult

34:29.300 --> 34:31.580
for me to accept that I'm a gay woman

34:31.580 --> 34:34.180
than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.

34:34.180 --> 34:36.740
It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain

34:36.740 --> 34:38.580
where I traded my sexual orientation

34:38.580 --> 34:39.900
for my gender identity.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.460
So I finally transitioned,

34:41.460 --> 34:42.980
only to spend the next couple years

34:42.980 --> 34:44.980
living with a different kind of denial.

34:44.980 --> 34:48.340
And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.

34:48.340 --> 34:51.060
This is painful and incriminating to admit,

34:51.060 --> 34:54.140
but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.

34:54.140 --> 34:57.440
Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust

34:57.440 --> 34:59.460
toward things I saw trans lesbians doing,

34:59.460 --> 35:01.780
like this anime catgirl shit

35:01.780 --> 35:03.900
which clearly gets under my skin

35:04.620 --> 35:05.460
and not just because these people

35:05.460 --> 35:06.940
have been harassing me for three years.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.220
Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,

35:09.220 --> 35:12.920
this queasy combination of the hypersexual

35:12.920 --> 35:14.060
and the infantile.

35:14.060 --> 35:16.540
I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian conflutte.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.540
Meow meow, girl dick, nya nya.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.600
Here's the 97th picture of my own legs

35:20.600 --> 35:23.340
and thigh high stripy socks uwu.

35:23.340 --> 35:24.740
What is that about?

35:24.740 --> 35:26.380
Is this how women act?

35:26.380 --> 35:28.380
Cis people are gonna see this.

35:28.380 --> 35:30.100
They're not gonna let us into women's spaces

35:30.100 --> 35:32.260
if we act like that.

35:32.260 --> 35:35.180
Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings,

35:35.180 --> 35:37.540
but I confess to periodically sinking

35:37.540 --> 35:41.220
into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing

35:41.220 --> 35:43.180
at embarrassing trans lesbians.

35:43.180 --> 35:45.180
And if I was a different type of YouTuber,

35:45.180 --> 35:47.100
I could've turned this into content.

35:47.100 --> 35:50.420
At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,

35:50.420 --> 35:53.380
why are trans lesbians so cringey?

35:53.380 --> 35:56.220
They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.420
And that's the real darkness, isn't it?

35:58.420 --> 36:01.820
Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself

36:01.820 --> 36:03.180
like an honest American.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.620
No, just sitting there in absurd denial

36:05.620 --> 36:07.260
of who you are as a person,

36:07.260 --> 36:09.820
disparaging your own repressed identity

36:09.820 --> 36:11.020
to anyone who will listen.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.740
And I'm ashamed of that too.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.440
I'm ashamed I sunk that low.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.180
But all you can do is try to get better.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.480
And I'm trying to get better.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.200
I've broken free of the denial,

36:20.200 --> 36:22.760
and now I have to break free of the shame.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.220
Because shame is literally ruining my life.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.980
I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame,

36:28.980 --> 36:31.300
and she said I might wanna mention

36:31.300 --> 36:34.220
that one of the reasons she didn't wanna be with me

36:34.220 --> 36:37.660
is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.

36:37.660 --> 36:41.100
She said she feels like relationships between trans women

36:41.100 --> 36:44.180
are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society

36:44.180 --> 36:45.940
with no attempt to integrate.

36:45.940 --> 36:47.940
These are very painful words to hear

36:47.940 --> 36:49.740
from the woman you're in love with.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.620
But I understand why she feels that way.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.820
Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.100
But I can't be the hinge

36:58.100 --> 37:00.180
that connects her to mainstream society.

37:00.180 --> 37:02.220
And it's maddening to me that she feels that way,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.100
because I would have chosen her

37:04.100 --> 37:06.460
over every cis woman in the world.

37:06.460 --> 37:07.980
But I'm just another worthless freak

37:07.980 --> 37:10.380
without the authority of society behind me.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.180
So my love doesn't count.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.820
Shame, it poisons the soul.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.660
You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,

37:17.660 --> 37:20.380
is such a basic part of your humanity.

37:20.380 --> 37:23.760
And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.980
It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.

37:25.980 --> 37:28.420
It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.900
It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.460
And living in that state of mind is garbage.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.500
It's basically hell.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.320
Even after I realized my sexuality,

37:39.320 --> 37:42.540
I considered just shoving that shit back down,

37:42.540 --> 37:43.700
never coming out.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.260
I have all these fears about it.

37:45.260 --> 37:48.100
I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.020
I'm worried cis women or straight women

37:50.020 --> 37:51.740
I'm friends with will get weird about it.

37:51.740 --> 37:54.180
I'm worried I'll die a lonely, useless lesbian,

37:54.180 --> 37:56.240
in which case I should've just married a man,

37:56.240 --> 37:57.640
because at least then there'd be someone

37:57.640 --> 37:59.760
to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.400
I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.560
Although, I mean, love you boys,

38:04.560 --> 38:06.320
and please keep the attention coming,

38:06.320 --> 38:08.160
because I need all the validation I can get right now,

38:08.160 --> 38:10.560
but I will be fine without you.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.280
And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian

38:13.280 --> 38:15.760
ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.960
I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,

38:17.960 --> 38:21.080
just sacrificing my sexual orientation

38:21.080 --> 38:24.760
to regain that safe, comfortable, shameless feeling

38:24.760 --> 38:26.640
I used to have when walking down the street

38:26.640 --> 38:30.400
holding Chad's hand, feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.000
But if I don't deal with this now

38:32.000 --> 38:34.120
and work towards accepting myself,

38:34.120 --> 38:36.960
then I'm just gonna be in the same situation in 10 years,

38:36.960 --> 38:38.960
when I'm 41 years old and married to a man

38:38.960 --> 38:40.640
and having these same feelings.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.880
So it's time for this to stop,

38:41.880 --> 38:44.900
because literally the only good thing about being gay

38:44.900 --> 38:46.080
is doing gay shit.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.400
And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,

38:48.400 --> 38:50.280
no one's gonna wanna do gay shit with me.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.120
As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,

38:53.120 --> 38:54.240
how in the hell are you gonna prop up

38:54.240 --> 38:55.760
your narcissistic delusions?

38:55.760 --> 38:57.280
Look, I'm trying to stay positive.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.240
Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now,

38:59.240 --> 39:00.480
but just you wait.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.080
We all know how trends work.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.600
In 10 years, being a trans lesbian

39:04.600 --> 39:08.400
will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,

39:08.400 --> 39:10.120
and all the people who talk shit now

39:10.120 --> 39:11.840
will forget they ever said a word.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.920
That's right, even the straight trans girls

39:13.920 --> 39:16.440
will be making out with each other just for the clout.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.880
Like, we can be lesbians too.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.040
We are edgy.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.840
Oh, it's gonna be Madonna and Britney

39:21.840 --> 39:24.080
at the 2003 VMAs all over again.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.400
Mark my words.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.580
And among cis lesbians, oh,

39:27.580 --> 39:30.440
it will actually be a sign of prestige

39:30.440 --> 39:31.820
to have a trapped waifu.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.120
I can dream, right?

39:34.120 --> 39:37.160
Once you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?
