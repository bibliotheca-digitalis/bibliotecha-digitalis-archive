1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
All right children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,280
How do I put this delicately?

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,400
Your humble hostess is a total les.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,760
Shame.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,440
You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is,

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,080
but oh, it's so much worse than just that.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,440
You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness,

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,400
And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
gay.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,440
Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,680
So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,880
in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key lesbicious behavior.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,840
And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,760
So story time, I fell in love with my best friend.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,060
Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,720
Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
piping hot.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,080
For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm a super fucking bi.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,280
the straight lifestyle.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,800
This really started in 2018, by that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,680
a fully heterosexual woman.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,520
And we're gonna circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
of things.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm like an epic poet.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Hail Muse.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
Hey how are you, gorge?

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,400
So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I'd even say best friends, with a

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,400
woman whomp-style called Joanne.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Light of my life.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Can we get some melodramatic music please?

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
Yeah, here we go.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
You're gonna want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,360
I want you to fully enjoy my pain.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,680
in-jokes, and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,760
We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,480
20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because I am a weird, and I don't get along

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
that well with that many people.

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,040
One reason we got so emotionally close is, we're both trans.

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,600
another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,480
Oh and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,440
notice every time I looked at her.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,320
And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
platonic either.

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,760
We'd get drunk and make out, we'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle, straight girls

52
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
do that right?

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Gal pals!

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,080
I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,960
and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand and

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
we walked down the street together holding hands.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,560
This is garbage and I want to die, I hope you all know that I'm in agony.

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,360
Later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink, we'd

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,840
run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Ah!

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,040
It's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,640
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,800
A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,320
They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.

65
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,200
Gal pals!

66
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Just kill me.

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,600
Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,720
the kids get home and they won't notice.

69
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,920
So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,020
or to myself that I was falling in love.

71
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,740
So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time I had

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,940
basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

73
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,860
So how could I possibly think that?

74
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Well, the short answer is shame.

75
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,180
Why is no one talking about the shame?

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,460
I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.

77
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,380
There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,260
Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,020
There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription

80
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,940
Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.

81
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,060
I'm a bronze star lesbian.

82
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,380
Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

84
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,580
I tried prayer.

85
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,380
I tried electric shocks.

86
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,620
All the classics.

87
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
All the hits.

88
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,500
You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,120
to associate the two in your head.

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,560
So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,600
This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
So at some point, the shame was just too much for me.

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,320
And it literally broke my brain.

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
I no longer wanted to be straight, I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Maybe a little bi.

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
A little bit.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,000
By that time, I had started dating men, and I got into a serious long-term relationship

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
with a man.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,920
At first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself, female friendships

100
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
are just really intense.

101
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,160
That's probably why I feel so strongly.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,040
And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I'd notice that.

103
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,600
And you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,480
So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,400
And then two things happened.

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
Fuck my drag, right?

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,240
I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,240
denial and bi-phobia allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as, I just have a

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,920
thing for my straight best friend.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Like who doesn't?

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,080
But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside

113
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,360
the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just, she's just not that

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
into women.

116
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,200
But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,800
And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.

118
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
It was a long distance friendship.

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,480
And about halfway through that visit, I cracked.

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:50,080
One morning, I woke up next to her, gal pals, and I looked at her pretty fucking face, and

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,760
I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,480
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio-girl to have about

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,640
her gal pal.

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.

126
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Like what the fuck is this?

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
What am I feeling?

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,040
I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,840
century Italian opera.

130
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,280
So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong, devastating.

131
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,560
She did not reciprocate my feelings.

132
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Nurse!

133
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!

134
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,960
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah, I'm

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,480
sure we all know how that goes.

136
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,080
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three month friendship break right then and there,

137
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,400
I might have recovered.

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,460
But we couldn't keep away from each other.

139
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,820
She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me, because the

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,620
truth is, we were never just gal pals.

141
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,800
And I was beyond reason, like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,740
joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got.

143
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Those are great by the way.

144
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,940
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

145
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,820
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just

146
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,860
repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.

147
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,340
Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year,

148
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,300
because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.

149
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,700
But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
worse.

151
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,140
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got

152
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,180
super fucking canceled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.

153
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,180
Link in the description, subscribe!

154
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,540
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was gonna have to be the one to enforce

155
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,940
a friendship break, otherwise I was never gonna get over her.

156
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,460
So there was this combination of things, being politically canceled by Twitter, being

157
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,540
romantically canceled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend, which sent

158
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,140
me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.

159
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,340
And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.

160
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,860
Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes

161
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
feel outside yourself.

162
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,180
And with that, comes a new perspective.

163
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,740
So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day and binge-watching

164
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,020
Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

165
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,700
And that gave me a new kind of clarity.

166
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,340
I looked back on the last couple years, and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.

167
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,900
So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a, uh, I am a gay.

168
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Not clickbait.

169
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:56,860
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

170
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Shame.

171
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,900
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.

172
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,860
Well that's my Eden.

173
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Candy flipping.

174
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I love it.

175
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,580
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches

176
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,860
of the straight agenda.

177
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,160
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

178
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,140
First there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

179
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Female friendships are just really intense.

180
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,900
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

181
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,980
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic

182
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
attraction to men.

183
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,540
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

184
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,980
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame

185
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,380
will overpower me again, and I'll slide back into denial.

186
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,180
So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.

187
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,660
Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis

188
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
of my own personality.

189
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
She's a Libra.

190
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,860
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

191
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,500
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that, like it makes you grow breasts,

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,340
at least, in theory.

193
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,780
I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.

194
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,300
But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your

195
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
sexuality.

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,820
The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual, because

197
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,580
the libido I had known before was just gone.

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,740
But I'm very much not asexual, it just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,060
female sex drive.

200
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,420
One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.

201
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,820
Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way, it sparks my interest,

202
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,860
but it doesn't light my fire.

203
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,420
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

204
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,340
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

205
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,900
Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about, but I think

206
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,300
the concept it describes applies to me.

207
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

208
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,340
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them

209
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
as a friend.

210
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,740
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,780
Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay-married?

212
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,140
I know that's not how it works.

213
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,420
I have to play the field.

214
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,300
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

215
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,700
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

216
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
It's boring.

217
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,500
The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and

218
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
shame.

219
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,340
I shouldn't, but I want to.

220
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,940
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

221
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,140
I'm also guessing this kind of slow-burn sexuality is more common in women than men.

222
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,820
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age

223
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
than gay women.

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,540
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about

225
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,740
who you're attracted to, whereas there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're

226
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,420
gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.

227
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,460
And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

228
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,500
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality, because I do feel

229
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,180
aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender, and that can be pretty intense

230
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
in its own right.

231
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,260
I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating

232
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,860
to me than looking at a beautiful man, which can be moving in its own way, but it's more

233
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,980
like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.

234
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,300
You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.

235
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,620
That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean I'd fuck the Parthenon.

236
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
I'd fuck it so hard.

237
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,380
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity, and maybe that stems from

238
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,940
my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

239
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:59,180
There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.

240
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms enfolding my

241
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,900
smooth, fragile body.

242
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,020
Or maybe it's more Freudian, the masculine man as daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic

243
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,780
power of the phallus, penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

244
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,940
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy

245
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,060
man and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do

246
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
things to me.

247
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,900
And I can find things I like about male bodies, like they're very warm.

248
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,180
I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.

249
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,020
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head, and she says,

250
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,740
but are you attracted to men?

251
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,100
Or do you just like being warm?

252
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,980
My attraction to women is very different.

253
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,820
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

254
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,380
This is going to destroy me.

255
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,620
You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.

256
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,020
I've never once been in pain over male beauty, but around Joanne, once I was open about my

257
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,060
feelings and things got bad, there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be

258
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,060
like, don't even enter my line of sight right now, you're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

259
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,460
There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

260
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,260
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

261
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,220
And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

262
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,420
I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.

263
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,460
It's that they're interested in me, and that's pretty interesting.

264
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,540
I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

265
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,460
You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.

266
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,500
Fuck me up, king.

267
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,740
God, that's hot.

268
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,220
Gets me every time.

269
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,700
But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,

270
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,580
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

271
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,020
You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.

272
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,780
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

273
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,060
And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women

274
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,420
is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.

275
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,140
It's all very passive, and in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

276
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,500
I've taken a very submissive role.

277
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,180
Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let him do things to me.

278
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,620
And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.

279
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,860
I like that feeling myself, and I do genuinely enjoy

280
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,300
taking on a more submissive role sometimes.

281
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,340
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

282
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,740
Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid

283
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,700
confronting what your desires actually are.

284
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,580
It's freedom from freedom.

285
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,780
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,

286
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,980
and ashamed of your transsexual body,

287
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,900
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

288
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,380
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

289
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,460
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

290
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,780
by letting someone else take control

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,900
can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.

292
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,060
And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

293
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,980
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

294
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,660
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

295
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,700
isn't really that much more liberated.

296
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,380
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago,

297
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,980
and totally identified with the fantasy.

298
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,420
And later, I thought that was evidence

299
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,020
I had normative female desires.

300
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,580
Never mind that I was identifying

301
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,420
with the midlife crisis fantasies

302
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,060
of a repressed English housewife

303
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,060
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

304
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,700
I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy

305
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,860
a healthier version of that fantasy.

306
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,820
I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer

307
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,020
under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

308
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,260
But what makes me different is that for me,

309
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,380
submission to a man was simply the only way

310
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,220
I could enjoy sex without shame.

311
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,420
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

312
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,780
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

313
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,100
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

314
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,780
straight women are ultimately attracted to men

315
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,580
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

316
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,780
Or are they?

317
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,180
Gay men certainly are,

318
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,020
and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

319
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,180
But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh

320
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,220
about male bodies and men in general.

321
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,100
Which, what is that about?

322
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,940
I just, I just do not understand straight women.

323
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,540
I don't think I ever will, and that's okay.

324
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment

325
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,360
and move on with my lesbian life.

326
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,380
Now, what I've been giving you so far

327
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,500
is a retrospective analysis,

328
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,300
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

329
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,340
But you have to understand

330
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,060
that when I was living through this,

331
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,820
I experienced it very differently

332
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,860
because I didn't have these insights.

333
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,660
So I wasn't thinking, oh, I'm not really attracted to men,

334
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,140
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

335
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,500
so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself

336
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.

337
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,740
No, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,

338
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,220
at least until Joanne ruined my life.

339
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,500
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

340
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,980
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

341
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,420
I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half

342
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,900
who I had very genuine feelings for.

343
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,060
Plot twist, story time.

344
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,060
So my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.

345
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,240
Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga-Chad fantasy.

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,980
You know, he was very masculine,

347
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,620
taller than me, objectively attractive, very charming.

348
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,380
Straight women used to tell me all the time

349
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,100
they were jealous of me for being with him,

350
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,060
and obviously I loved that.

351
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,220
To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,

352
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,980
a sort of archetypal romantic elite

353
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,740
who swept me off my feet and fulfilled my sick fantasies

354
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,460
of being a heterosexual woman.

355
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,020
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say

356
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,740
that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

357
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,320
but that once it came to actually dating,

358
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,780
I realized I didn't like it.

359
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,300
But honestly, it's more complicated than that.

360
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,860
Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him,

361
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,700
and I still think of him as the one

362
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,980
genuine boy crush of my life.

363
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,740
When we started dating, it was really exciting.

364
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,260
I'd never had a boyfriend before,

365
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,300
and he'd never been with a trans woman before,

366
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,820
and we had this, like,

367
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,280
adorably heterosexual energy together,

368
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,460
like holding hands in the park.

369
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
It was cute.

370
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,460
This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a Cad.

371
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,600
But he wasn't.

372
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
He was great.

373
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,820
He took very good care of me.

374
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,420
He was never ashamed to be seen with me,

375
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,260
or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,

376
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,260
which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.

377
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,720
He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself,

378
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,440
and when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed,

379
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,040
and that meant a lot.

380
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,200
So I really wanted this to work.

381
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.

382
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,260
And for a year or so, I thought it was working.

383
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,080
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

384
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,280
I missed him when he was gone.

385
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,520
I told him I loved him, and I meant it.

386
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,360
But what happened is, by the end of the first year,

387
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,200
the initial excitement had died down,

388
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,720
and while Chad was ready

389
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,160
to keep escalating the relationship,

390
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,480
I was realizing that something was very seriously,

391
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
emotionally wrong on my end.

392
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
There was something missing.

393
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,180
And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,

394
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,000
I was like, there's that missing feeling.

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,200
And I started to understand what my problem was.

396
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,120
Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram

397
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,600
an aloof picture of me with the caption,

398
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,080
do I actually like men, or do I just like attention?

399
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,840
And I didn't mean anything serious by that,

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,440
I was just joking around.

401
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,960
You know, you can post something like that,

402
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,920
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

403
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,540
yeah, fuck men.

404
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,120
What is their damage?

405
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,280
Well, they're stuck dating men, that's their damage.

406
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,360
But a few people left comments saying,

407
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,560
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

408
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,400
You should make a video about comphet.

409
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?

410
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,640
So I Googled it, and I learned that comphet is short

411
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,720
for compulsory heterosexuality.

412
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,320
Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality

413
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,560
is socially required of women,

414
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,120
and it's so bound up with the conventional idea

415
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,520
of what it even means to be a woman,

416
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,440
that gay women often mistakenly believe for years

417
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,920
that they're attracted to men.

418
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,560
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post

419
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,120
called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

420
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,320
And I'm reading through this post like,

421
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,240
oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

422
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,680
Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head

423
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,720
that says I must really be het,

424
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,760
even when I'm in love with a woman.

425
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,280
Quote, you have every reason to be happy

426
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,520
in your relationship with a man, but you just aren't.

427
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,040
Everything is going really well,

428
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,800
but something is missing and you can't figure out what.

429
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,000
So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

430
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes

431
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,580
that were clearly designed for 13-year-olds.

432
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,040
And I'm fully a 31-year-old transsexual

433
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,560
taking this quiz like, it's true, Samantha was right,

434
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,120
I am a total les.

435
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,080
All the cis gay people watching this video

436
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,800
probably wanna kill me right now,

437
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,880
cause y'all figured this shit out in high school

438
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,200
and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

439
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,960
it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.

440
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay

441
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,040
for 30 minutes of my lifetime please?

442
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,240
Is it all right with you, the gays?

443
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,000
So to be honest, I still experience

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,760
comphet thoughts and fantasies.

445
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,640
Like for a long time, I've had what seemed

446
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,760
to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.

447
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,200
But after a lot of introspection,

448
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,880
I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

449
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,480
of private happiness and fulfillment.

450
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,680
It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.

451
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,360
Like can you imagine if I got married

452
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,720
to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,040
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

454
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,360
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

455
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.

456
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,520
But I don't actually wanna be married.

457
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,000
I wanna get married.

458
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,360
I wanna have a wedding.

459
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,080
Basically, I wanna wear a wedding dress.

460
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,680
I want attention, okay?

461
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,880
Please, pay attention to me.

462
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,

463
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,400
but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

464
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,120
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality

465
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,280
because there's a level of gender instability

466
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,440
and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.

467
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,320
And until recently, I wasn't secure enough

468
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
in my gender to handle that.

469
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,520
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

470
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,040
and I think I needed to go through

471
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,320
the more one-on-one straight girl experience

472
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,920
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

473
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,160
I still have a hard time imagining

474
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,900
a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.

475
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,640
And I think that's partly because

476
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,160
good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.

477
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,800
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama

478
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,920
from 15 years ago, which I do like,

479
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,280
and I like the new one too.

480
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,800
But after that, the runner-up is,

481
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,320
I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

482
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,520
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whomst we ship.

483
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,400
Well, I don't ship them,

484
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,360
because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush

485
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,680
on Katya Zamolodchikova.

486
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Don't laugh at me.

487
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,840
She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful.

488
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

489
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Sure, some haters and losers will probably try

490
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,360
to convince me that Katya is in fact a homosexual man

491
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,320
posing as a woman, but you know what?

492
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,800
This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,

493
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,660
and I don't need this right now.

494
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,920
I need to be touched by a real woman.

495
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm losing my goddamn mind.

496
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,440
It's so deeply embedded in our culture

497
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,520
that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.

498
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,960
And it's not just Disney movies.

499
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,200
Like, it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology,

500
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
German fairy tales, Victorian novels.

501
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,220
The whole weight of cultural history is telling you

502
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,580
that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.

503
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,620
And if you're already super dysphoric

504
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,900
and insecure about your gender,

505
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,180
then to reject that possibility,

506
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,820
ah, it hurts, it hurts so bad.

507
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,420
But whenever I think about having a long-term partner,

508
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,060
you know, not the wedding day,

509
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,800
but the 1,000th morning waking up together,

510
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,400
I can only imagine her being a woman.

511
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,700
My brain wants a good man to take care of me,

512
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,900
but my heart wants a high-maintenance diva

513
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,020
to ruin my life.

514
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,820
And once I knew that for sure,

515
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,620
I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.

516
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,020
And this man was like my hinge.

517
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,100
He was holding me together.

518
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,420
But last December,

519
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,860
I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian,

520
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,420
which at least is a good reason.

521
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,780
I'm having a hard time, you guys.

522
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,500
Leave your pity in the comments.

523
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,420
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.

524
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,400
I feel like shit.

525
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,220
I think that's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me.

526
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,860
Like, I could really use a couple Advil and a vodka tonic.

527
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,140
I think I might throw some clothes on, too.

528
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,940
Where's that snake?

529
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,780
Mm.

530
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,820
I already miss my heterosexual nails.

531
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,100
I know these are too long to be gay,

532
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,620
but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.

533
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,940
Getting my acrylics removed, traumatizing.

534
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,260
I feel like I'm detransitioning.

535
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,420
One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure

536
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,140
with acrylics on eight fingers.

537
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,340
I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon

538
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,460
and say, hi, I'm a homosexual, please.

539
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,480
I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.

540
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,980
Shame.

541
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,220
Let's talk about the shame.

542
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,260
Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women,

543
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,780
though two of those women later turned out to be trans,

544
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,300
so I guess we had some way of finding each other.

545
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,300
An attraction to women was never really a problem for me

546
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,540
before the transgendering,

547
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,300
because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle

548
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,860
where men are supposed to be attracted to women.

549
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,900
Crazy, I know.

550
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,980
Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty?

551
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,380
I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.

552
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,820
And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around

553
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,900
my being, at the time, a gender nonconforming man,

554
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,580
which, in my early YouTube videos,

555
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,240
I dealt with by caricaturing myself

556
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,880
and basically leaning into the public humiliation,

557
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,600
one of my classic techniques.

558
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
But now, my shame is centered around my failure

559
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
to be a socially acceptable woman,

560
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,920
and the most glaring aspects of that failure

561
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,960
are my male past, my sexual orientation,

562
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,480
and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.

563
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah, killing all those people

564
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,560
was not my most feminine moment,

565
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,280
but I was having a bad skin day.

566
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,440
What was I supposed to do?

567
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.

568
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,520
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

569
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,920
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

570
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,340
And whatever one times two is,

571
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,720
I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.

572
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Ugh.

573
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,840
And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings

574
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,120
because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.

575
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,160
Why is no one talking about the shame?

576
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,560
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

577
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,600
But we shouldn't be.

578
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,680
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

579
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,480
I grew up in a media era when trans women

580
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,680
were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities

581
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,040
who deserve the violence they bring

582
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,560
upon themselves by existing.

583
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,360
And I started my transition in the first year

584
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
of the Trump administration,

585
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,840
when there's been constant vilification

586
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,240
of trans people in the press.

587
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
Invading women's bathrooms,

588
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,760
forcing our insanity on children,

589
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,680
destroying Western civilization

590
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,460
with our authoritarian pronouns.

591
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,620
It's hard to express just the daily humiliation

592
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,700
of being a trans woman under these conditions.

593
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,580
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,

594
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,540
like my laser technician recently told me,

595
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,660
you must be very courageous to transition

596
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,660
because that is not socially acceptable.

597
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,700
And then she went back to blasting laser beams

598
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,580
into my asshole.

599
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,100
And then there's the internet where, you know,

600
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,860
I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.

601
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,820
And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet

602
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,860
are a wretched, wretched horde

603
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,660
of bigoted attack helicopters.

604
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,820
The whole point of this channel

605
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,980
is I try to talk sense to these people.

606
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,100
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives,

607
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
and I try to empathize with their point of view

608
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,900
and provide a rational response.

609
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,060
But a side effect of all that research

610
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,260
is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing.

611
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,460
It's seeped into my brain and become a part of me.

612
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,740
And this lifelong buildup of shame

613
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,100
has become a wound at the heart of my existence.

614
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,540
And all I can really do about it

615
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,980
is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

616
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,780
I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.

617
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,580
I am resplendent trash.

618
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,340
I am couture trash.

619
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,620
And I just bought a mid-century gold-trimmed

620
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,940
Venetian blown glass decanter,

621
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,580
which helps me forget the shame and self-loathing

622
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,220
that plagues my every moment.

623
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused

624
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,660
about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

625
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,600
when I've already come out as trans,

626
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,260
which seems like a bigger deal.

627
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,820
To paraphrase what some people have told me,

628
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,580
you're already a transgendered, and a freak's a freak,

629
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,300
so who cares what kind of freak?

630
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,060
Well, first of all, I would like to propose

631
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,620
a sociological theory.

632
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,780
Tiffany's Law, all freaks have a deep psychological need

633
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,340
to feel superior to a different type of freak.

634
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,900
And trans lesbians are pretty close

635
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,580
to the bottom of that pecking order.

636
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,640
Who's even left for me to feel superior to,

637
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,100
the goddamn Belgians?

638
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,940
Fuck this waffle.

639
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,900
Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me

640
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,660
because I did it incrementally over like eight years.

641
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,900
At first I was like, well,

642
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,260
I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.

643
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup,

644
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,260
I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.

645
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,820
And then I realized I'm not a man at all,

646
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,700
and I identified as non-binary.

647
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,580
Then I started taking hormones.

648
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,940
In two months on HRT, I woke up one day and said,

649
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,780
it's fine, I am literally a woman.

650
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,620
So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman,

651
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,060
that was actually a step up in terms of social acceptability

652
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,340
from where I was before.

653
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,220
When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,

654
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,900
I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.

655
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,980
Whereas when I started transitioning to female,

656
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,460
even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,

657
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,100
there was at least a goal in mind,

658
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,300
some possible future where I could lead

659
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,420
a normal-ish life as a woman.

660
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,820
So the moment I started identifying as a woman

661
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,180
was the moment the comphet voice entered my head.

662
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,420
Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before,

663
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,740
but maybe I'm attracted to them now.

664
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I'm a woman, right?

665
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,340
I've always been a little bi-curious,

666
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,940
and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.

667
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,580
Maybe I can make this work.

668
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,460
Let's choose some boys to be attracted to

669
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,040
and get started on this.

670
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,420
Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.

671
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,320
My way of explaining it to myself was,

672
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,780
I guess hormones just magically changed

673
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,300
my sexual orientation to the socially acceptable one.

674
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
That's super freaking crazy.

675
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,460
Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.

676
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,300
God, there's so much pressure on trans women

677
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,420
to be extremely gender-conforming,

678
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,860
and even more so if you're a representative

679
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
of the community.

680
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,780
You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife

681
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,420
or else cis people are gonna throw us all in camps.

682
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,020
And early in my transition,

683
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,180
I kind of worshiped straight trans women.

684
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,980
Like, I looked up to them,

685
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,700
and I wanted to be just like them.

686
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,660
Now back then, there were a handful

687
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,420
of trans lesbians on YouTube

688
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,380
trying to make the case to the masses

689
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,000
that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.

690
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,620
But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.

691
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
I watched those women get eaten alive.

692
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,860
And as a result of my witnessing that

693
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,340
at a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

694
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,140
I internalized the message that a trans lesbian

695
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,460
is just not an okay thing to be

696
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,420
if you want to be tolerated or respected

697
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,820
by anybody other than a handful of communists.

698
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,740
So I began my transition with essentially no role model

699
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,660
of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.

700
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,900
And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia

701
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,540
are harsher on gay trans women

702
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,100
than they are on straight trans women.

703
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,580
Like, take this trope that trans women are men

704
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,220
who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.

705
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,500
In response to that, it feels really good

706
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,140
to be able to say, I'm not even attracted to women,

707
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,340
I'm just a petite heterosexual bio girl,

708
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,180
I'm surely not some kind of six foot monster

709
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,900
who likes women.

710
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,400
Shame.

711
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,240
Shame.

712
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,100
It does make me feel like a monster sometimes,

713
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,420
like a mutant that has no place in society.

714
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,300
And this shame has actually made it more difficult

715
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,580
for me to accept that I'm a gay woman

716
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,180
than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.

717
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,740
It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain

718
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,580
where I traded my sexual orientation

719
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,900
for my gender identity.

720
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,460
So I finally transitioned,

721
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,980
only to spend the next couple years

722
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
living with a different kind of denial.

723
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,340
And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.

724
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,060
This is painful and incriminating to admit,

725
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,140
but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.

726
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,440
Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust

727
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,460
toward things I saw trans lesbians doing,

728
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,780
like this anime catgirl shit

729
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,900
which clearly gets under my skin

730
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
and not just because these people

731
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,940
have been harassing me for three years.

732
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,220
Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,

733
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,920
this queasy combination of the hypersexual

734
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,060
and the infantile.

735
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian conflutte.

736
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Meow meow, girl dick, nya nya.

737
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,600
Here's the 97th picture of my own legs

738
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,340
and thigh high stripy socks uwu.

739
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,740
What is that about?

740
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,380
Is this how women act?

741
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Cis people are gonna see this.

742
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,100
They're not gonna let us into women's spaces

743
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,260
if we act like that.

744
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,180
Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings,

745
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,540
but I confess to periodically sinking

746
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,220
into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing

747
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,180
at embarrassing trans lesbians.

748
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
And if I was a different type of YouTuber,

749
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,100
I could've turned this into content.

750
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,420
At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,

751
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,380
why are trans lesbians so cringey?

752
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,220
They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.

753
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,420
And that's the real darkness, isn't it?

754
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,820
Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself

755
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,180
like an honest American.

756
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,620
No, just sitting there in absurd denial

757
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,260
of who you are as a person,

758
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,820
disparaging your own repressed identity

759
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
to anyone who will listen.

760
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,740
And I'm ashamed of that too.

761
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm ashamed I sunk that low.

762
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,180
But all you can do is try to get better.

763
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,480
And I'm trying to get better.

764
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,200
I've broken free of the denial,

765
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,760
and now I have to break free of the shame.

766
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,220
Because shame is literally ruining my life.

767
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,980
I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame,

768
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,300
and she said I might wanna mention

769
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,220
that one of the reasons she didn't wanna be with me

770
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,660
is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.

771
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,100
She said she feels like relationships between trans women

772
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,180
are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society

773
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,940
with no attempt to integrate.

774
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
These are very painful words to hear

775
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,740
from the woman you're in love with.

776
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,620
But I understand why she feels that way.

777
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,820
Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.

778
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,100
But I can't be the hinge

779
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,180
that connects her to mainstream society.

780
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,220
And it's maddening to me that she feels that way,

781
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,100
because I would have chosen her

782
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,460
over every cis woman in the world.

783
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,980
But I'm just another worthless freak

784
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,380
without the authority of society behind me.

785
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,180
So my love doesn't count.

786
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,820
Shame, it poisons the soul.

787
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,660
You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,

788
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,380
is such a basic part of your humanity.

789
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,760
And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.

790
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,980
It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.

791
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,420
It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.

792
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,900
It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.

793
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,460
And living in that state of mind is garbage.

794
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,500
It's basically hell.

795
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,320
Even after I realized my sexuality,

796
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,540
I considered just shoving that shit back down,

797
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,700
never coming out.

798
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,260
I have all these fears about it.

799
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,100
I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.

800
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,020
I'm worried cis women or straight women

801
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,740
I'm friends with will get weird about it.

802
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,180
I'm worried I'll die a lonely, useless lesbian,

803
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,240
in which case I should've just married a man,

804
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
because at least then there'd be someone

805
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,760
to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.

806
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.

807
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,560
Although, I mean, love you boys,

808
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
and please keep the attention coming,

809
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,160
because I need all the validation I can get right now,

810
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
but I will be fine without you.

811
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,280
And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian

812
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?

813
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,960
I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,

814
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,080
just sacrificing my sexual orientation

815
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,760
to regain that safe, comfortable, shameless feeling

816
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,640
I used to have when walking down the street

817
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,400
holding Chad's hand, feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.

818
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
But if I don't deal with this now

819
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,120
and work towards accepting myself,

820
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,960
then I'm just gonna be in the same situation in 10 years,

821
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
when I'm 41 years old and married to a man

822
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,640
and having these same feelings.

823
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,880
So it's time for this to stop,

824
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,900
because literally the only good thing about being gay

825
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,080
is doing gay shit.

826
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,400
And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,

827
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,280
no one's gonna wanna do gay shit with me.

828
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,120
As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,

829
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,240
how in the hell are you gonna prop up

830
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,760
your narcissistic delusions?

831
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
Look, I'm trying to stay positive.

832
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,240
Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now,

833
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,480
but just you wait.

834
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,080
We all know how trends work.

835
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,600
In 10 years, being a trans lesbian

836
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,400
will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,

837
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,120
and all the people who talk shit now

838
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,840
will forget they ever said a word.

839
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,920
That's right, even the straight trans girls

840
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,440
will be making out with each other just for the clout.

841
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,880
Like, we can be lesbians too.

842
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,040
We are edgy.

843
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,840
Oh, it's gonna be Madonna and Britney

844
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,080
at the 2003 VMAs all over again.

845
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,400
Mark my words.

846
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,580
And among cis lesbians, oh,

847
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,440
it will actually be a sign of prestige

848
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,820
to have a trapped waifu.

849
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,120
I can dream, right?

850
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,160
Once you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?
