0	18960	All right children, it's a new decade, it's time to face the facts.
18960	21280	How do I put this delicately?
21280	24400	Your humble hostess is a total les.
24400	26760	Shame.
26760	31440	You're probably worried this is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is,
31440	35080	but oh, it's so much worse than just that.
35080	41440	You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune, two, looks like carelessness,
41440	45120	and three, well at that point you're just doing it for attention.
45120	50400	And I do love attention, I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be
50400	51400	gay.
51400	54440	Some gay people love attention, it's been known to happen.
54440	59680	So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself
59680	64880	in the mirror, and admit this is some high-key lesbicious behavior.
64880	67840	And I'm going to talk you through how I got to that point.
67840	70760	So story time, I fell in love with my best friend.
70760	73060	Story time, telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.
73060	77720	Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang, exposed, graphic, the tea is
77720	78720	piping hot.
78720	83080	For a long time on this channel, the official story has been that I'm bi.
83080	84560	I'm a super fucking bi.
84560	89840	But I haven't dated women since I transitioned, and for a while there, I got pretty deep into
89840	91280	the straight lifestyle.
91280	96800	This really started in 2018, by that summer, I had privately convinced myself that I was
96800	99680	a fully heterosexual woman.
99680	104520	And we're gonna circle back to how I reached that conclusion, but I'm starting in the middle
104520	105520	of things.
105520	106520	I'm like an epic poet.
106520	107520	Hail Muse.
107520	109920	Hey how are you, gorge?
109920	114400	So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends, I'd even say best friends, with a
114400	120400	woman whomp-style called Joanne.
120400	121400	Light of my life.
121400	123200	Can we get some melodramatic music please?
123200	124600	Yeah, here we go.
124600	126680	You're gonna want to pour yourself a glass of something nice.
126680	129360	I want you to fully enjoy my pain.
129360	132400	So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.
132400	136560	It was that kind of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and
136560	140680	in-jokes, and you drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.
140680	143760	We'd call each other pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours.
143760	147040	And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing or smiling in the first
147040	152480	20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because I am a weird, and I don't get along
152480	153960	that well with that many people.
153960	157040	One reason we got so emotionally close is, we're both trans.
157040	161200	And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that I can share with
161200	164600	another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else.
164640	171480	Oh and by the way, Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did
171480	173440	notice every time I looked at her.
173440	178320	And from the beginning of this relationship, it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly
178320	179320	platonic either.
179320	183760	We'd get drunk and make out, we'd sleep in the same bed and cuddle, straight girls
183760	184760	do that right?
184760	185760	Gal pals!
185760	191080	I remember one of the first times I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together,
191080	195960	and that night we were bar hopping and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand and
195960	198160	we walked down the street together holding hands.
198160	203560	This is garbage and I want to die, I hope you all know that I'm in agony.
203560	207360	Later we were at a bar table with friends, and every time one of us needed a drink, we'd
207360	210840	run off to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.
210840	211840	Ah!
211840	215040	It's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.
215040	217640	Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.
217680	221800	A lot of men think girls kissing is hot, but they don't take it seriously.
221800	225320	They don't think it could ever mean anything or lead to a real relationship.
225320	228200	Gal pals!
228200	229200	Just kill me.
229200	233600	Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before
233600	235720	the kids get home and they won't notice.
235720	240920	So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to Joanne
240920	244020	or to myself that I was falling in love.
244020	248740	So not only was I in denial about being in love with her, but at the same time I had
248740	252940	basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.
252940	254860	So how could I possibly think that?
254860	257860	Well, the short answer is shame.
257860	260180	Why is no one talking about the shame?
260180	263460	I was so ashamed of my attraction to women.
263460	266380	There were days I thought the shame was going to crush me to death.
266380	272260	Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.
272260	277020	There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in the town square with the inscription
277020	279940	Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual.
279940	282060	I'm a bronze star lesbian.
282060	286380	Well, if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star.
286380	288380	Oh, I was desperate to be straight.
288380	289580	I tried prayer.
289580	291380	I tried electric shocks.
291380	292620	All the classics.
292620	293620	All the hits.
293620	297500	You know, the idea is if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start
297500	299120	to associate the two in your head.
299120	301560	So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.
301560	307600	This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.
307600	310160	So at some point, the shame was just too much for me.
310160	312320	And it literally broke my brain.
312320	317840	I no longer wanted to be straight, I simply deluded myself into thinking I was straight.
317840	318840	Maybe a little bi.
318840	319840	A little bit.
319840	325000	By that time, I had started dating men, and I got into a serious long-term relationship
325000	326000	with a man.
326000	329920	At first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne by telling myself, female friendships
329920	331320	are just really intense.
331320	334160	That's probably why I feel so strongly.
334160	339040	And everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I'd notice that.
339040	344600	And you know, spend a lot of time thinking about it.
344600	347480	So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.
347480	349400	And then two things happened.
349400	352400	First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.
356000	360240	Fuck my drag, right?
360240	365240	I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but some combination of self-interested
365240	370240	denial and bi-phobia allowed me to write off my initial crush on her as, I just have a
370240	371920	thing for my straight best friend.
371920	372920	Like who doesn't?
372920	377080	But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside
377080	382360	the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.
382360	385840	Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just, she's just not that
385840	386840	into women.
386840	390200	But once she started dating women, I couldn't tell myself that anymore.
390200	394800	And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.
394800	399000	Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.
399000	400400	It was a long distance friendship.
400400	403480	And about halfway through that visit, I cracked.
403480	410080	One morning, I woke up next to her, gal pals, and I looked at her pretty fucking face, and
410080	414760	I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.
414760	420480	And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio-girl to have about
420480	421640	her gal pal.
421640	425840	Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone.
425840	427680	Like what the fuck is this?
427680	428760	What am I feeling?
428760	434040	I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of 19th
434040	435840	century Italian opera.
435840	443280	So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong, devastating.
443280	445560	She did not reciprocate my feelings.
445560	446560	Nurse!
446560	449280	My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!
449280	452960	Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah, I'm
452960	454480	sure we all know how that goes.
454480	459080	And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three month friendship break right then and there,
459080	460400	I might have recovered.
460400	462460	But we couldn't keep away from each other.
462460	466820	She wasn't in love with me, but she must have been in something with me, because the
466820	469620	truth is, we were never just gal pals.
469620	474800	And I was beyond reason, like, I probably would have started one of those lesbian couple
474800	477740	joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got.
477740	478740	Those are great by the way.
478740	479940	Pay no attention to bitter queens.
479940	484820	So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just
484820	487860	repeated this heartbreak again and again and again.
487860	492340	Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have come out as gay last year,
492340	496300	because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating shame.
496300	500700	But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation
500700	501700	worse.
501700	507140	So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got
507140	510180	super fucking canceled on Twitter as discussed in my last video.
510180	512180	Link in the description, subscribe!
512180	516540	And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was gonna have to be the one to enforce
516540	519940	a friendship break, otherwise I was never gonna get over her.
519940	523460	So there was this combination of things, being politically canceled by Twitter, being
523460	528540	romantically canceled by Joanne, and also losing her as my closest friend, which sent
528540	532140	me into this catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.
532140	537340	And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a purpose.
537340	542860	Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill, you sometimes
542860	544860	feel outside yourself.
544860	547180	And with that, comes a new perspective.
547180	551740	So last December, when I was lying around drinking white claw all day and binge-watching
551740	556020	Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.
556020	558700	And that gave me a new kind of clarity.
558700	563340	I looked back on the last couple years, and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious.
563340	570900	So that's what it took for me to finally face the fact that I am a, uh, I am a gay.
570900	571900	Not clickbait.
577180	596860	Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.
596860	604860	Shame.
604860	609900	This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind and a little more Coachella 2015.
609900	611860	Well that's my Eden.
611860	612860	Candy flipping.
612860	613860	I love it.
613860	618580	Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches
618580	619860	of the straight agenda.
619860	623160	It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.
623160	627140	First there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.
627140	629140	Female friendships are just really intense.
629140	630900	Straight girls have girl crushes too.
630940	635980	And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought was sexual and romantic
635980	636980	attraction to men.
636980	640540	And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.
640540	644980	Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video, but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame
644980	648380	will overpower me again, and I'll slide back into denial.
648380	653180	So while I'm still thinking semi-clearly, let me talk you through the struggle.
653180	657660	Because like most queer people, I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis
657660	658660	of my own personality.
658660	659660	She's a Libra.
659980	662860	So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.
662860	667500	And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that, like it makes you grow breasts,
667500	670340	at least, in theory.
670340	672780	I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.
672780	676300	But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your
676300	677300	sexuality.
677300	681820	The first few months I was on hormones, I actually wondered if I was now asexual, because
681820	684580	the libido I had known before was just gone.
684980	690740	But I'm very much not asexual, it just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically
690740	693060	female sex drive.
693060	698420	One of the differences for me is it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.
698420	703820	Just looking at an attractive person, well, let's put it this way, it sparks my interest,
703820	705860	but it doesn't light my fire.
705860	709420	It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.
709420	712340	It's a slow burn that has to be built up.
712340	717900	Some people call this demisexual, which is a term I'm ambivalent about, but I think
717900	720300	the concept it describes applies to me.
720300	723900	Like I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,
723900	728340	but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone until I've gotten close to them
728340	729340	as a friend.
729340	732740	So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?
732740	736780	Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay-married?
736780	739140	I know that's not how it works.
739140	740420	I have to play the field.
740420	744300	I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.
744300	747700	Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.
747700	748700	It's boring.
748700	753500	The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part, and the struggle between desire and
753500	754500	shame.
754500	757340	I shouldn't, but I want to.
757340	758940	That's how you build a plotline, kids.
758940	764140	I'm also guessing this kind of slow-burn sexuality is more common in women than men.
764140	768820	And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend to know they're gay at an earlier age
768820	769820	than gay women.
770220	774540	When you have teenage boy testosterone levels, it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about
774540	778740	who you're attracted to, whereas there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're
778740	781420	gay until they're in their 30s, or even later.
781420	785460	And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.
785460	790500	So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest as a guide to my sexuality, because I do feel
790500	795180	aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender, and that can be pretty intense
795180	796180	in its own right.
796180	802260	I guess the difference for me is looking at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating
802260	807860	to me than looking at a beautiful man, which can be moving in its own way, but it's more
807860	811980	like the way I'm moved by, I don't know, the Parthenon.
811980	816300	You know, it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.
816300	819620	That's not to say it's totally asexual, I mean I'd fuck the Parthenon.
819620	820620	I'd fuck it so hard.
820740	826380	I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity, and maybe that stems from
826380	831940	my pre-transition sense of having failed at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.
831940	839180	There's something about the contrast between me and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.
839180	847180	Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms enfolding my
847180	849900	smooth, fragile body.
850540	856020	Or maybe it's more Freudian, the masculine man as daddy, the archetypal father, the symbolic
856020	859780	power of the phallus, penetration as the ultimate expression of desire and possession.
859780	864940	There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood, and I think that's why I can look at a sexy
864940	870060	man and create plausible fantasies in my head where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do
870060	871060	things to me.
871060	876900	And I can find things I like about male bodies, like they're very warm.
876900	880180	I love it when you get under the covers with a man and he warms you up.
880180	883020	But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head, and she says,
883020	885740	but are you attracted to men?
885740	888100	Or do you just like being warm?
888100	889980	My attraction to women is very different.
889980	896820	I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like, oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.
896820	898380	This is going to destroy me.
898380	901620	You know, it can actually be painful how beautiful a woman is.
901620	906020	I've never once been in pain over male beauty, but around Joanne, once I was open about my
906020	910060	feelings and things got bad, there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her and be
910060	914060	like, don't even enter my line of sight right now, you're too beautiful, I can't stand it.
914060	918460	There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.
918460	920260	It's insatiable, like an addiction.
920260	925220	And on the flip side, there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.
925220	928420	I think that's what got me interested in men in the first place.
928420	933460	It's that they're interested in me, and that's pretty interesting.
933500	938540	I've felt desired by men in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.
938540	944460	You know, a man will glower at you with that agitated, carnivorous desperation.
944460	945500	Fuck me up, king.
945500	946740	God, that's hot.
946740	948220	Gets me every time.
948220	953700	But notice how excitement at the attention, the flattery of being desired,
953700	957580	is not the same thing as attraction to men.
957580	963020	You know, there's a difference between I want you and I like that you want me.
963020	965780	But for a long time, I confused one for the other.
965780	971060	And one reason I was able to do that is that the normative sexual role for women
971060	977420	is to be pursued, possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.
977420	982140	It's all very passive, and in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,
982140	984500	I've taken a very submissive role.
984500	989180	Sometimes I just submit to the glower and let him do things to me.
989180	994620	And I do think that the thrill of being desired is a valid thing to want.
994620	997860	I like that feeling myself, and I do genuinely enjoy
997860	1000300	taking on a more submissive role sometimes.
1000300	1002340	But you have to go about it thoughtfully.
1002340	1007740	Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way to avoid
1007740	1010700	confronting what your desires actually are.
1010700	1012580	It's freedom from freedom.
1012580	1014780	And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,
1014780	1016980	and ashamed of your transsexual body,
1016980	1019900	and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all
1019900	1023380	because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,
1023380	1026460	then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires
1026460	1028780	by letting someone else take control
1028780	1031900	can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.
1031900	1035060	And for a while, it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.
1035060	1037980	And I was able to convince myself that was normal
1037980	1041660	because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women
1041660	1043700	isn't really that much more liberated.
1043700	1046380	Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago,
1046380	1048980	and totally identified with the fantasy.
1048980	1051420	And later, I thought that was evidence
1051420	1054020	I had normative female desires.
1054020	1055580	Never mind that I was identifying
1055580	1057420	with the midlife crisis fantasies
1057420	1059060	of a repressed English housewife
1059060	1062060	longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.
1062060	1064700	I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy
1064700	1066860	a healthier version of that fantasy.
1066860	1068820	I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer
1068820	1071020	under a kind of feminist guilt about that.
1071020	1073260	But what makes me different is that for me,
1073260	1076380	submission to a man was simply the only way
1076380	1078220	I could enjoy sex without shame.
1078220	1080420	And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,
1080420	1083780	even though my real sexual attraction is to women.
1083780	1087100	Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,
1087100	1090780	straight women are ultimately attracted to men
1090780	1092580	and sexually aroused by male bodies.
1092580	1093780	Or are they?
1093780	1095180	Gay men certainly are,
1095180	1098020	and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.
1098020	1101180	But a lot of straight women are just kind of meh
1101180	1103220	about male bodies and men in general.
1104020	1106100	Which, what is that about?
1106100	1109940	I just, I just do not understand straight women.
1109940	1112540	I don't think I ever will, and that's okay.
1112540	1114540	I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment
1114540	1116360	and move on with my lesbian life.
1116360	1119380	Now, what I've been giving you so far
1119380	1121500	is a retrospective analysis,
1121500	1125300	an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.
1125300	1126340	But you have to understand
1126340	1128060	that when I was living through this,
1128060	1129820	I experienced it very differently
1129820	1131860	because I didn't have these insights.
1131860	1134660	So I wasn't thinking, oh, I'm not really attracted to men,
1134660	1137140	but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,
1137140	1139500	so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself
1139500	1141700	from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.
1141700	1145740	No, subconsciously, I put my attraction to women on mute,
1145740	1148220	at least until Joanne ruined my life.
1148220	1150500	And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,
1150500	1153980	which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.
1153980	1157420	I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half
1157420	1159900	who I had very genuine feelings for.
1159900	1162060	Plot twist, story time.
1162060	1167060	So my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.
1167620	1172240	Oh, and he was a Chad, like full giga-Chad fantasy.
1172240	1173980	You know, he was very masculine,
1173980	1177620	taller than me, objectively attractive, very charming.
1177620	1179380	Straight women used to tell me all the time
1179380	1181100	they were jealous of me for being with him,
1181100	1183060	and obviously I loved that.
1183060	1187220	To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,
1187220	1189980	a sort of archetypal romantic elite
1189980	1193740	who swept me off my feet and fulfilled my sick fantasies
1193740	1195460	of being a heterosexual woman.
1195460	1197020	Now, you probably think I'm gonna say
1197020	1199740	that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,
1199740	1202320	but that once it came to actually dating,
1202320	1203780	I realized I didn't like it.
1203780	1206300	But honestly, it's more complicated than that.
1206300	1209860	Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him,
1209860	1211700	and I still think of him as the one
1211700	1213980	genuine boy crush of my life.
1213980	1216740	When we started dating, it was really exciting.
1216740	1218260	I'd never had a boyfriend before,
1218260	1220300	and he'd never been with a trans woman before,
1220300	1221820	and we had this, like,
1221820	1224280	adorably heterosexual energy together,
1224280	1226460	like holding hands in the park.
1226460	1227460	It was cute.
1227460	1230460	This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a Cad.
1230460	1231600	But he wasn't.
1231600	1232440	He was great.
1232440	1233820	He took very good care of me.
1233820	1236420	He was never ashamed to be seen with me,
1236420	1239260	or of his friends and family knowing he was dating me,
1239260	1243260	which, if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.
1243260	1246720	He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself,
1247560	1250440	and when I was with him, I wasn't ashamed,
1250440	1253040	and that meant a lot.
1253040	1255200	So I really wanted this to work.
1255200	1259200	Like, if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.
1259200	1262260	And for a year or so, I thought it was working.
1262260	1264080	I enjoyed the time we spent together.
1264080	1266280	I missed him when he was gone.
1266280	1268520	I told him I loved him, and I meant it.
1268520	1271360	But what happened is, by the end of the first year,
1271360	1274200	the initial excitement had died down,
1274200	1275720	and while Chad was ready
1275720	1278160	to keep escalating the relationship,
1278160	1282480	I was realizing that something was very seriously,
1282480	1284480	emotionally wrong on my end.
1284480	1285760	There was something missing.
1285760	1289180	And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,
1289180	1292000	I was like, there's that missing feeling.
1292000	1295200	And I started to understand what my problem was.
1295200	1299120	Then, last fall, I posted to Instagram
1299120	1301600	an aloof picture of me with the caption,
1301680	1305080	do I actually like men, or do I just like attention?
1305080	1306840	And I didn't mean anything serious by that,
1306840	1308440	I was just joking around.
1308440	1309960	You know, you can post something like that,
1309960	1311920	and a bunch of straight women will respond like,
1311920	1313540	yeah, fuck men.
1314880	1316120	What is their damage?
1316120	1318280	Well, they're stuck dating men, that's their damage.
1318280	1320360	But a few people left comments saying,
1320360	1322560	oh, are you making a video about comphet?
1322560	1324400	You should make a video about comphet.
1324400	1327200	And I was like, what the fuck is comphet?
1327200	1330640	So I Googled it, and I learned that comphet is short
1330640	1332720	for compulsory heterosexuality.
1332720	1335320	Basically, it's the idea that heterosexuality
1335320	1337560	is socially required of women,
1337560	1340120	and it's so bound up with the conventional idea
1340120	1342520	of what it even means to be a woman,
1342520	1346440	that gay women often mistakenly believe for years
1346440	1347920	that they're attracted to men.
1347920	1350560	And this Google search led me to a Reddit post
1350560	1353120	called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?
1353120	1355320	And I'm reading through this post like,
1355320	1359240	oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.
1359240	1362680	Quote, compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head
1362680	1364720	that says I must really be het,
1364720	1366760	even when I'm in love with a woman.
1366760	1369280	Quote, you have every reason to be happy
1369280	1372520	in your relationship with a man, but you just aren't.
1372520	1374040	Everything is going really well,
1374040	1376800	but something is missing and you can't figure out what.
1376800	1380000	So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.
1380000	1382320	and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes
1382320	1384580	that were clearly designed for 13-year-olds.
1384580	1387040	And I'm fully a 31-year-old transsexual
1387040	1390560	taking this quiz like, it's true, Samantha was right,
1390560	1392120	I am a total les.
1392120	1394080	All the cis gay people watching this video
1394080	1395800	probably wanna kill me right now,
1395800	1397880	cause y'all figured this shit out in high school
1397880	1400200	and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,
1400200	1402960	it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.
1402960	1404960	Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay
1404960	1407040	for 30 minutes of my lifetime please?
1407040	1409240	Is it all right with you, the gays?
1409240	1412000	So to be honest, I still experience
1412000	1413760	comphet thoughts and fantasies.
1413760	1415640	Like for a long time, I've had what seemed
1415640	1418760	to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.
1418760	1420200	But after a lot of introspection,
1420200	1423880	I've realized that this is not really a fantasy
1423880	1426480	of private happiness and fulfillment.
1426480	1430680	It's a fantasy of social prestige and acceptance.
1430680	1433360	Like can you imagine if I got married
1433360	1437720	to a tall, handsome man at an opulent wedding
1437720	1441040	with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?
1441040	1443360	Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.
1443360	1445200	I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.
1445720	1447520	But I don't actually wanna be married.
1447520	1449000	I wanna get married.
1449000	1450360	I wanna have a wedding.
1450360	1453080	Basically, I wanna wear a wedding dress.
1453080	1454680	I want attention, okay?
1454680	1456880	Please, pay attention to me.
1456880	1459360	So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,
1459360	1462400	but it's still really hard for me to let it go.
1462400	1466120	I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality
1466120	1469280	because there's a level of gender instability
1469280	1472440	and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality.
1472440	1475320	And until recently, I wasn't secure enough
1475320	1477320	in my gender to handle that.
1477320	1480520	Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,
1480520	1482040	and I think I needed to go through
1482040	1484320	the more one-on-one straight girl experience
1484320	1486920	before attempting anything as difficult as that.
1486920	1489160	I still have a hard time imagining
1489160	1492900	a happy future for myself as a woman partnered to a woman.
1492900	1494640	And I think that's partly because
1494640	1498160	good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.
1498160	1500800	The best we have is a Showtime melodrama
1500800	1503920	from 15 years ago, which I do like,
1503920	1505280	and I like the new one too.
1505280	1507800	But after that, the runner-up is,
1507800	1511320	I mean, maybe not the lesbian representation we need.
1511320	1514520	It's a YouTube show about two drag queens whomst we ship.
1514520	1515400	Well, I don't ship them,
1515400	1518360	because I have a fully lesbian parasocial internet crush
1518360	1519680	on Katya Zamolodchikova.
1519680	1520680	Don't laugh at me.
1520680	1523840	She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful.
1523840	1525440	That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.
1525440	1527760	Sure, some haters and losers will probably try
1527760	1530360	to convince me that Katya is in fact a homosexual man
1530360	1532320	posing as a woman, but you know what?
1532320	1534800	This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,
1534800	1536660	and I don't need this right now.
1538480	1539920	I need to be touched by a real woman.
1539920	1542800	I'm losing my goddamn mind.
1542800	1545440	It's so deeply embedded in our culture
1545440	1548520	that marrying a man is the end goal of womanhood.
1548520	1549960	And it's not just Disney movies.
1549960	1554200	Like, it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology,
1554200	1556600	German fairy tales, Victorian novels.
1556600	1559220	The whole weight of cultural history is telling you
1559220	1562580	that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.
1562580	1564620	And if you're already super dysphoric
1564620	1566900	and insecure about your gender,
1566900	1569180	then to reject that possibility,
1569180	1571820	ah, it hurts, it hurts so bad.
1571820	1574420	But whenever I think about having a long-term partner,
1574420	1576060	you know, not the wedding day,
1576060	1578800	but the 1,000th morning waking up together,
1580100	1582400	I can only imagine her being a woman.
1582400	1585700	My brain wants a good man to take care of me,
1585700	1588900	but my heart wants a high-maintenance diva
1588980	1590020	to ruin my life.
1590020	1591820	And once I knew that for sure,
1593220	1595620	I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.
1595620	1598020	And this man was like my hinge.
1598020	1600100	He was holding me together.
1600100	1601420	But last December,
1603840	1607860	I broke up with him because I'm a lesbian,
1607860	1611420	which at least is a good reason.
1614900	1616780	I'm having a hard time, you guys.
1616780	1618500	Leave your pity in the comments.
1619160	1620420	And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.
1620420	1621400	I feel like shit.
1621400	1624220	I think that's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me.
1624220	1626860	Like, I could really use a couple Advil and a vodka tonic.
1626860	1629140	I think I might throw some clothes on, too.
1629140	1630940	Where's that snake?
1630940	1631780	Mm.
1639220	1642820	I already miss my heterosexual nails.
1642820	1644100	I know these are too long to be gay,
1644100	1646620	but baby steps, okay, this is hard for me.
1646620	1648940	Getting my acrylics removed, traumatizing.
1648940	1650260	I feel like I'm detransitioning.
1650260	1652420	One of these days, I will do the lesbian manicure
1652420	1654140	with acrylics on eight fingers.
1654140	1656340	I just have to find the courage to walk into a salon
1656340	1659460	and say, hi, I'm a homosexual, please.
1659460	1662480	I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy.
1664060	1664980	Shame.
1664980	1666220	Let's talk about the shame.
1666220	1670260	Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women,
1670260	1673780	though two of those women later turned out to be trans,
1673780	1676300	so I guess we had some way of finding each other.
1676980	1679300	An attraction to women was never really a problem for me
1679300	1680540	before the transgendering,
1680540	1683300	because I was raised in an alternative lifestyle
1683300	1685860	where men are supposed to be attracted to women.
1685860	1686900	Crazy, I know.
1686900	1690980	Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because, oh, sweaty?
1690980	1694380	I was doing plenty of things that men are not supposed to do.
1694380	1696820	And before I transitioned, my shame was centered around
1696820	1699900	my being, at the time, a gender nonconforming man,
1699900	1701580	which, in my early YouTube videos,
1701580	1704240	I dealt with by caricaturing myself
1704280	1707880	and basically leaning into the public humiliation,
1707880	1709600	one of my classic techniques.
1709600	1712320	But now, my shame is centered around my failure
1712320	1714320	to be a socially acceptable woman,
1714320	1716920	and the most glaring aspects of that failure
1716920	1720960	are my male past, my sexual orientation,
1720960	1724480	and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.
1724480	1725680	Yeah, killing all those people
1725680	1727560	was not my most feminine moment,
1727560	1730280	but I was having a bad skin day.
1730280	1731440	What was I supposed to do?
1731440	1734240	So there's two problems that kind of multiply together.
1734240	1736520	One, I'm ashamed of being trans.
1736520	1738920	Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.
1738920	1742340	And whatever one times two is,
1742340	1746720	I'm really ashamed of being a trans lesbian.
1746720	1747560	Ugh.
1747560	1751840	And it's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings
1751840	1756120	because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.
1756120	1758160	Why is no one talking about the shame?
1758160	1760560	Because we are ashamed of the shame.
1760560	1761600	But we shouldn't be.
1761600	1764680	The shame is a natural result of shaming.
1764680	1767480	I grew up in a media era when trans women
1767480	1770680	were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities
1770680	1772040	who deserve the violence they bring
1772040	1773560	upon themselves by existing.
1773560	1775360	And I started my transition in the first year
1775360	1776640	of the Trump administration,
1776640	1778840	when there's been constant vilification
1778840	1780240	of trans people in the press.
1780240	1781680	Invading women's bathrooms,
1781680	1783760	forcing our insanity on children,
1783760	1785680	destroying Western civilization
1785680	1787460	with our authoritarian pronouns.
1787460	1790620	It's hard to express just the daily humiliation
1790620	1792700	of being a trans woman under these conditions.
1792700	1794580	And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,
1794580	1797540	like my laser technician recently told me,
1797540	1799660	you must be very courageous to transition
1799660	1802660	because that is not socially acceptable.
1802660	1804700	And then she went back to blasting laser beams
1804700	1805580	into my asshole.
1805580	1808100	And then there's the internet where, you know,
1808100	1810860	I used to spend most of my life before the sadness took over.
1810860	1812820	And I'm sure we all know that people on the internet
1812820	1814860	are a wretched, wretched horde
1814860	1816660	of bigoted attack helicopters.
1816660	1817820	The whole point of this channel
1817820	1819980	is I try to talk sense to these people.
1819980	1822100	I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives,
1822100	1824100	and I try to empathize with their point of view
1824100	1825900	and provide a rational response.
1825900	1828060	But a side effect of all that research
1828060	1831260	is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing.
1831260	1834460	It's seeped into my brain and become a part of me.
1834460	1836740	And this lifelong buildup of shame
1836740	1840100	has become a wound at the heart of my existence.
1840100	1841540	And all I can really do about it
1841540	1844980	is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.
1844980	1848780	I may be trash, but I am majestic trash.
1848780	1850580	I am resplendent trash.
1850580	1852340	I am couture trash.
1852340	1856620	And I just bought a mid-century gold-trimmed
1856620	1858940	Venetian blown glass decanter,
1858940	1861580	which helps me forget the shame and self-loathing
1861580	1863220	that plagues my every moment.
1863220	1866220	Now I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused
1866220	1868660	about why I'm so ashamed of being gay
1868660	1870600	when I've already come out as trans,
1870600	1872260	which seems like a bigger deal.
1872260	1874820	To paraphrase what some people have told me,
1875660	1877580	you're already a transgendered, and a freak's a freak,
1877580	1879300	so who cares what kind of freak?
1879300	1882060	Well, first of all, I would like to propose
1882060	1883620	a sociological theory.
1883620	1887780	Tiffany's Law, all freaks have a deep psychological need
1887780	1890340	to feel superior to a different type of freak.
1890340	1892900	And trans lesbians are pretty close
1892900	1894580	to the bottom of that pecking order.
1894580	1896640	Who's even left for me to feel superior to,
1896640	1898100	the goddamn Belgians?
1898100	1899940	Fuck this waffle.
1899940	1902900	Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me
1902940	1905660	because I did it incrementally over like eight years.
1905660	1906900	At first I was like, well,
1906900	1909260	I'm just a man who wears makeup sometimes.
1909260	1912260	Then I was like, actually, it's not just clothes and makeup,
1912260	1915260	I'm actually pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways.
1915260	1916820	And then I realized I'm not a man at all,
1916820	1918700	and I identified as non-binary.
1918700	1920580	Then I started taking hormones.
1920580	1922940	In two months on HRT, I woke up one day and said,
1922940	1925780	it's fine, I am literally a woman.
1925780	1928620	So by the time I actually came out as a trans woman,
1928620	1932060	that was actually a step up in terms of social acceptability
1932100	1933340	from where I was before.
1933340	1935220	When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,
1935220	1936900	I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere.
1936900	1939980	Whereas when I started transitioning to female,
1939980	1942460	even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,
1942460	1945100	there was at least a goal in mind,
1945100	1947300	some possible future where I could lead
1947300	1949420	a normal-ish life as a woman.
1949420	1951820	So the moment I started identifying as a woman
1951820	1954180	was the moment the comphet voice entered my head.
1954180	1956420	Sure, I've never been very attracted to men before,
1956420	1958740	but maybe I'm attracted to them now.
1958740	1959740	I'm a woman, right?
1959740	1961340	I've always been a little bi-curious,
1961340	1963940	and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.
1963940	1965580	Maybe I can make this work.
1965580	1967460	Let's choose some boys to be attracted to
1967460	1969040	and get started on this.
1969040	1971420	Of course, I wasn't as self-aware as that.
1971420	1973320	My way of explaining it to myself was,
1973320	1975780	I guess hormones just magically changed
1975780	1978300	my sexual orientation to the socially acceptable one.
1978300	1979580	That's super freaking crazy.
1979580	1982460	Shut up, you goddamn lesbo.
1982460	1984300	God, there's so much pressure on trans women
1984300	1986420	to be extremely gender-conforming,
1986420	1988860	and even more so if you're a representative
1988860	1989860	of the community.
1989860	1991780	You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife
1991780	1994420	or else cis people are gonna throw us all in camps.
1994420	1996020	And early in my transition,
1996020	1998180	I kind of worshiped straight trans women.
1998180	1999980	Like, I looked up to them,
1999980	2001700	and I wanted to be just like them.
2001700	2003660	Now back then, there were a handful
2003660	2005420	of trans lesbians on YouTube
2005420	2007380	trying to make the case to the masses
2007380	2010000	that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing.
2010000	2013620	But in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.
2013620	2015540	I watched those women get eaten alive.
2015540	2017860	And as a result of my witnessing that
2017860	2020340	at a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,
2020340	2024140	I internalized the message that a trans lesbian
2024140	2026460	is just not an okay thing to be
2026460	2028420	if you want to be tolerated or respected
2028420	2030820	by anybody other than a handful of communists.
2030820	2033740	So I began my transition with essentially no role model
2033740	2036660	of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.
2036660	2039900	And it doesn't help that most forms of transphobia
2039900	2041540	are harsher on gay trans women
2041540	2043100	than they are on straight trans women.
2043100	2045580	Like, take this trope that trans women are men
2045580	2048220	who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.
2048220	2050500	In response to that, it feels really good
2050500	2053140	to be able to say, I'm not even attracted to women,
2053140	2055340	I'm just a petite heterosexual bio girl,
2055340	2058180	I'm surely not some kind of six foot monster
2058180	2059900	who likes women.
2059900	2061400	Shame.
2061400	2062240	Shame.
2062240	2064100	It does make me feel like a monster sometimes,
2064100	2066420	like a mutant that has no place in society.
2066420	2069300	And this shame has actually made it more difficult
2069300	2071580	for me to accept that I'm a gay woman
2071580	2074180	than it was for me to come out as trans in the first place.
2074180	2076740	It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain
2076740	2078580	where I traded my sexual orientation
2078580	2079900	for my gender identity.
2079900	2081460	So I finally transitioned,
2081460	2082980	only to spend the next couple years
2082980	2084980	living with a different kind of denial.
2084980	2088340	And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.
2088340	2091060	This is painful and incriminating to admit,
2091060	2094140	but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.
2094140	2097440	Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust
2097440	2099460	toward things I saw trans lesbians doing,
2099460	2101780	like this anime catgirl shit
2101780	2103900	which clearly gets under my skin
2104620	2105460	and not just because these people
2105460	2106940	have been harassing me for three years.
2106940	2109220	Like you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,
2109220	2112920	this queasy combination of the hypersexual
2112920	2114060	and the infantile.
2114060	2116540	I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian conflutte.
2116540	2118540	Meow meow, girl dick, nya nya.
2118540	2120600	Here's the 97th picture of my own legs
2120600	2123340	and thigh high stripy socks uwu.
2123340	2124740	What is that about?
2124740	2126380	Is this how women act?
2126380	2128380	Cis people are gonna see this.
2128380	2130100	They're not gonna let us into women's spaces
2130100	2132260	if we act like that.
2132260	2135180	Now I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings,
2135180	2137540	but I confess to periodically sinking
2137540	2141220	into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing
2141220	2143180	at embarrassing trans lesbians.
2143180	2145180	And if I was a different type of YouTuber,
2145180	2147100	I could've turned this into content.
2147100	2150420	At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,
2150420	2153380	why are trans lesbians so cringey?
2153380	2156220	They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.
2156220	2158420	And that's the real darkness, isn't it?
2158420	2161820	Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself
2161820	2163180	like an honest American.
2163180	2165620	No, just sitting there in absurd denial
2165620	2167260	of who you are as a person,
2167260	2169820	disparaging your own repressed identity
2169820	2171020	to anyone who will listen.
2171020	2172740	And I'm ashamed of that too.
2172740	2174440	I'm ashamed I sunk that low.
2174440	2177180	But all you can do is try to get better.
2177180	2178480	And I'm trying to get better.
2178480	2180200	I've broken free of the denial,
2180200	2182760	and now I have to break free of the shame.
2182760	2186220	Because shame is literally ruining my life.
2186220	2188980	I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame,
2188980	2191300	and she said I might wanna mention
2191300	2194220	that one of the reasons she didn't wanna be with me
2194220	2197660	is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.
2197660	2201100	She said she feels like relationships between trans women
2201100	2204180	are freakish behavior on the outskirts of society
2204180	2205940	with no attempt to integrate.
2205940	2207940	These are very painful words to hear
2207940	2209740	from the woman you're in love with.
2209740	2212620	But I understand why she feels that way.
2212620	2215820	Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women.
2215820	2218100	But I can't be the hinge
2218100	2220180	that connects her to mainstream society.
2220180	2222220	And it's maddening to me that she feels that way,
2222220	2224100	because I would have chosen her
2224100	2226460	over every cis woman in the world.
2226460	2227980	But I'm just another worthless freak
2227980	2230380	without the authority of society behind me.
2230380	2232180	So my love doesn't count.
2232180	2234820	Shame, it poisons the soul.
2234820	2237660	You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,
2237660	2240380	is such a basic part of your humanity.
2240380	2243760	And shame about that cuts to the core of your being.
2243760	2245980	It's not I'm ashamed of what I did.
2245980	2248420	It's not I'm ashamed of how I feel.
2248420	2251900	It's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.
2251900	2255460	And living in that state of mind is garbage.
2255460	2257500	It's basically hell.
2257500	2259320	Even after I realized my sexuality,
2259320	2262540	I considered just shoving that shit back down,
2262540	2263700	never coming out.
2263700	2265260	I have all these fears about it.
2265260	2268100	I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously.
2268100	2270020	I'm worried cis women or straight women
2270020	2271740	I'm friends with will get weird about it.
2271740	2274180	I'm worried I'll die a lonely, useless lesbian,
2274180	2276240	in which case I should've just married a man,
2276240	2277640	because at least then there'd be someone
2277640	2279760	to kill the spiders and fix the fucking sink.
2279760	2282400	I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.
2282400	2284560	Although, I mean, love you boys,
2284560	2286320	and please keep the attention coming,
2286320	2288160	because I need all the validation I can get right now,
2288160	2290560	but I will be fine without you.
2290560	2293280	And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian
2293280	2295760	ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?
2295760	2297960	I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,
2297960	2301080	just sacrificing my sexual orientation
2301080	2304760	to regain that safe, comfortable, shameless feeling
2304760	2306640	I used to have when walking down the street
2306640	2310400	holding Chad's hand, feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.
2310400	2312000	But if I don't deal with this now
2312000	2314120	and work towards accepting myself,
2314120	2316960	then I'm just gonna be in the same situation in 10 years,
2316960	2318960	when I'm 41 years old and married to a man
2318960	2320640	and having these same feelings.
2320640	2321880	So it's time for this to stop,
2321880	2324900	because literally the only good thing about being gay
2324900	2326080	is doing gay shit.
2326080	2328400	And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,
2328400	2330280	no one's gonna wanna do gay shit with me.
2330280	2333120	As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,
2333120	2334240	how in the hell are you gonna prop up
2334240	2335760	your narcissistic delusions?
2335760	2337280	Look, I'm trying to stay positive.
2337280	2339240	Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now,
2339240	2340480	but just you wait.
2340480	2342080	We all know how trends work.
2342080	2344600	In 10 years, being a trans lesbian
2344600	2348400	will be the coolest, hippest, chicest thing imaginable,
2348400	2350120	and all the people who talk shit now
2350120	2351840	will forget they ever said a word.
2351840	2353920	That's right, even the straight trans girls
2353920	2356440	will be making out with each other just for the clout.
2356440	2358880	Like, we can be lesbians too.
2358880	2360040	We are edgy.
