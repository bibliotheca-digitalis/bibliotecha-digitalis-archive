00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Hello again, the gays.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.880
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.560
Straight people, you're of course welcome

00:08.560 --> 00:12.440
to tag along too, provided you're emotionally damaged.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.440
Hi, hey, how are you?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.560
Cringe, let's talk about it.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.520
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.840
It just pops into my head all the time.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.020
Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013

00:25.020 --> 00:27.160
when all of my Facebook posts were just lyrics

00:27.160 --> 00:30.320
to Ke$ha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.160
Why?

00:31.160 --> 00:32.880
What audience was that for?

00:32.880 --> 00:35.760
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.840
Cringe, mega cringe.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.040
I think I say this word like 50 times a day.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.620
Cringe, cringe, cringe.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.760
And I'm not the only one.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.480
Google Trends shows that in the US,

00:44.480 --> 00:45.920
search interest in the word cringe

00:45.920 --> 00:48.200
has dramatically increased over the last decade,

00:48.200 --> 00:51.160
peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.760
And if you look at worldwide trends,

00:52.760 --> 00:55.440
search interest in cringe is at an all-time high

00:55.440 --> 00:57.120
the month I'm making this video.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.000
So what is cringe?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.480
Well, let's start with some examples.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.760
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled,

01:03.760 --> 01:06.000
What Things Really Make You Cringe?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.160
And here's some of the most upvoted responses.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.920
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding

01:09.920 --> 01:11.280
when I wasn't supposed to,

01:11.280 --> 01:12.800
and everyone at the wedding turned around

01:12.800 --> 01:14.720
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.240
Recordings of my own voice.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.840
When I remember that I did the,

01:17.840 --> 01:21.120
I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school thing.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.980
Early teen me, so many cringe stuff I did.

01:23.980 --> 01:26.440
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.000
This happened about two years ago.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.800
I ordered some pizza hot online,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.040
and when it was delivered,

01:31.040 --> 01:32.840
the lady handed me the pizza boxes.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.920
I said, thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.320
I said, oh, and then she hands me the receipt

01:38.320 --> 01:39.440
to sign and leave a tip,

01:39.440 --> 01:42.060
and I spend 30 seconds trying to get the pen to work.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.240
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.140
I said, oh, and then she reaches to get the receipt

01:48.140 --> 01:49.720
and tells me the pizza smells good.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.280
Then I said, you too,

01:51.280 --> 01:53.040
and then I closed the door and killed myself.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.120
All of these responses illustrate exactly

01:55.120 --> 01:57.120
what writer Melissa Dahl says in her book,

01:57.120 --> 01:59.400
Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.260
According to Dahl, the moments that make us cringe

02:02.260 --> 02:04.520
are when we're yanked out of our own perspective

02:04.520 --> 02:06.180
and we can suddenly see ourselves

02:06.180 --> 02:08.080
from somebody else's point of view.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.440
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter,

02:10.440 --> 02:13.700
who in the 60s did a study of the Biame tribe in New Guinea,

02:13.700 --> 02:15.400
where he showed them mirror, video,

02:15.400 --> 02:17.960
and photographic images of themselves for the first time

02:17.960 --> 02:19.440
and described the results.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.680
They were paralyzed.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.520
After their first startled response,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.480
covering their mouths and ducking their heads,

02:24.480 --> 02:27.160
they stood transfixed, staring at their images,

02:27.160 --> 02:29.840
only their stomach muscles, betraying great tension.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.080
So basically, they cringed at themselves.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.720
Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.360
Like, pretty much everyone seems to hate

02:36.360 --> 02:38.400
the sound of their voice when they hear a recording

02:38.400 --> 02:39.280
for the first time.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.640
I guess because it sounds different

02:40.640 --> 02:42.600
from the way you hear it resonating in your head.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.700
So when you hear the recording, you realize,

02:44.700 --> 02:47.680
oh God, that's how other people hear me all the time.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.760
And you're suddenly aware of this clash

02:49.760 --> 02:51.840
between the way you appear to yourself

02:51.840 --> 02:53.480
and the way you appear to other people.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.920
That's when you cringe, the feeling Dahl describes

02:55.920 --> 02:58.580
as the intense visceral reaction produced

02:58.580 --> 03:00.960
by an awkward moment, an unpleasant kind

03:00.960 --> 03:03.760
of self-recognition, where you suddenly see yourself

03:03.760 --> 03:05.360
through someone else's eyes.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.640
It's a forced moment of self-awareness,

03:07.640 --> 03:09.360
and it usually makes you cognizant

03:09.360 --> 03:11.920
of the disappointing fact that you aren't measuring up

03:11.920 --> 03:13.600
to your own self-concept.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.320
When you're talking too loud at a wedding

03:15.320 --> 03:16.840
and suddenly everyone turns around

03:16.840 --> 03:18.800
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up,

03:18.800 --> 03:20.960
you suddenly realize how you look to them,

03:20.960 --> 03:23.240
because we've all at some point turned around

03:24.000 --> 03:25.040
to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.360
But this time, you're the asshole, cringe.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.560
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm

03:31.560 --> 03:32.840
that makes us cringe.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.580
There's no law of state or even of etiquette

03:35.580 --> 03:37.880
that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed

03:37.880 --> 03:38.920
to speak at a wedding.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.720
It's something you have to intuit based on context.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.360
How loud are other people speaking?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.920
Is the ceremony about to begin

03:44.920 --> 03:47.000
and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.340
According to YouTuber Vsauce, Michael here,

03:49.340 --> 03:50.960
the function of awkwardness is that

03:50.960 --> 03:53.640
it sands social dynamics by smoothing out

03:53.640 --> 03:56.560
what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.800
Cringe is the electric shock,

03:58.800 --> 04:01.920
the emotional punishment for being awkward.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.920
It enforces the limits of socially acceptable behavior

04:04.920 --> 04:06.780
by wounding the ego.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.440
And memories of your cringy moments

04:08.440 --> 04:11.240
are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.360
10 years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep

04:13.360 --> 04:14.860
and for no reason at all,

04:14.860 --> 04:16.800
your brain will decide to remind you

04:16.800 --> 04:19.080
of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding

04:19.080 --> 04:21.040
and of the stupid thing you were saying

04:21.040 --> 04:23.200
when everyone turned around to stare at you

04:23.200 --> 04:24.680
and you'll cringe all over again.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.520
That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful

04:27.520 --> 04:29.280
because you look back and you realize,

04:29.280 --> 04:34.280
damn, I was the asshole for like seven consecutive years.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.600
Can I just hire a hitman to kill everyone

04:36.600 --> 04:40.000
who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.100
Now all the examples we've considered so far

04:42.100 --> 04:43.560
involve self-cringe,

04:43.560 --> 04:46.360
but usually when we talk about cringe on the internet,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.720
we're talking about cringing at other people.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.040
Popular subreddits like r slash cringe,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.120
cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images

04:54.120 --> 04:56.200
of people behaving in cringey ways.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.800
For instance, a maternity photo

04:57.800 --> 04:59.240
that looks like a hostage crisis,

04:59.240 --> 05:01.560
grim moments of lamentation and cuckoldry,

05:01.560 --> 05:03.600
and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate

05:03.600 --> 05:06.040
during his first encounter with black people.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.120
Who let the dogs out?

05:07.120 --> 05:07.960
Who, who?

05:08.840 --> 05:12.600
Ugh, watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
It makes me want to crawl out of my body

05:14.600 --> 05:16.920
and escape into another dimension.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.960
I think some people feel cringe more intensely than others.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.080
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point

05:22.080 --> 05:24.720
where I will reflexively pause a video like that

05:24.720 --> 05:26.160
because I just can't stand it.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.560
In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube videos,

05:28.560 --> 05:30.960
which, sweaty, if you put that shit on,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.200
I will leave the room.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.040
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts

05:35.040 --> 05:37.280
in the same way as cringing at yourself?

05:37.280 --> 05:39.720
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people

05:39.720 --> 05:42.240
is simply vicarious embarrassment,

05:42.240 --> 05:43.840
or secondhand embarrassment.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.760
Basically, it's a form of empathy.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.000
When you cringe at someone,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.780
you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

05:49.780 --> 05:52.420
just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,

05:52.420 --> 05:55.120
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

05:55.120 --> 05:55.960
But there's a problem

05:55.960 --> 05:58.360
with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

05:58.360 --> 05:59.840
or at least a complication,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.240
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

06:02.240 --> 06:06.120
the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.320
In fact, often they're super confident,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.520
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness

06:10.520 --> 06:13.600
about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.600
Like when a woman posts

06:14.600 --> 06:17.280
a ridiculously over-facetuned picture of herself

06:17.280 --> 06:19.780
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.500
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

06:22.500 --> 06:25.360
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.040
So in the internet sense of the word,

06:27.040 --> 06:30.040
cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.840
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

06:32.840 --> 06:34.900
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

06:34.900 --> 06:38.320
but she knows it's embarrassing, and she feels embarrassed.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.480
You guys are just standing up

06:39.480 --> 06:40.880
because you feel bad that I fell,

06:40.880 --> 06:42.920
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.040
Nothing about this is cringe.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.160
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.800
Maybe she looks back on it, and it's still embarrassing,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.080
but I don't cringe at her.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.960
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone

06:54.960 --> 06:56.460
and cringing with them.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.520
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

06:59.520 --> 07:02.140
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

07:02.140 --> 07:04.560
My feelings mirror what she's feeling.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.840
But when I'm cringing at someone,

07:06.840 --> 07:08.400
I'm feeling something very different

07:08.400 --> 07:09.360
to what they're feeling.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.120
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

07:12.120 --> 07:16.040
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.920
Another example is bad American Idol auditions,

07:18.920 --> 07:21.160
which are quintessential cringe content.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.400
People try out for American Idol

07:23.400 --> 07:25.680
because they think they're good enough singers

07:25.680 --> 07:27.680
to compete in a national competition,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.280
so they're effectively revealing their own delusions

07:30.280 --> 07:32.440
when they show up and sing like this.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.440
♪ Is this the real life or is this just fantasy ♪

07:38.920 --> 07:41.680
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.560
Most of us are bad singers, right?

07:43.560 --> 07:45.720
When people sing Happy Birthday at a party,

07:45.720 --> 07:47.600
usually they're singing in three different keys

07:47.600 --> 07:48.960
at no particular tempo.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.720
But that's not cringe because the point

07:50.720 --> 07:53.520
of singing Happy Birthday is not to sound amazing.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.680
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

07:55.680 --> 07:58.840
because of the contestants' misplaced confidence.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.720
Who are you as good as, in your opinion?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.600
The lead singer from Queen.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.360
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

08:07.360 --> 08:10.040
when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.620
♪ Frozen, see ♪

08:14.080 --> 08:15.400
I admit that watching Red,

08:15.400 --> 08:17.960
I'm actually not in very much pain when I'm cringing at him.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.120
I laugh at his ludicrous performance,

08:20.120 --> 08:21.480
just like the judges do.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.480
And because he's so cocky,

08:23.480 --> 08:26.680
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

08:26.680 --> 08:29.340
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys

08:29.340 --> 08:30.220
his failure.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.040
There's almost a sense of karma,

08:32.040 --> 08:34.240
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

08:34.240 --> 08:37.840
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.640
And my sense that he deserves it

08:39.640 --> 08:42.160
suppresses my compassionate response,

08:42.160 --> 08:45.080
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

08:45.080 --> 08:47.860
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.520
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,

08:50.520 --> 08:52.440
Misha, who's there with her mom,

08:52.440 --> 08:54.960
and they both seem like such sweethearts.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.960
I do believe in her talent, very much.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.640
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.480
but I'm rooting for her,

09:02.480 --> 09:04.800
and when she embarrasses herself,

09:04.800 --> 09:08.880
I feel no joy, only deep and agonizing cringe.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.680
♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me ♪

09:13.680 --> 09:14.520
Yikes.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.040
My differing reactions to Red and Misha

09:17.040 --> 09:19.280
track a distinction that Doll makes

09:19.280 --> 09:22.800
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.360
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

09:26.360 --> 09:28.120
with the person you're cringing at.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.040
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves

09:30.040 --> 09:31.560
in the cringeworthy moment,

09:31.560 --> 09:34.420
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel,

09:35.060 --> 09:36.140
or perhaps ought to feel,

09:36.140 --> 09:39.420
if they were aware of how other people were perceiving them.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.580
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

09:41.580 --> 09:43.860
involves an emotional distancing

09:43.860 --> 09:45.500
from the person you're cringing at.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.300
Just like with compassionate cringe,

09:47.300 --> 09:50.380
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

09:50.380 --> 09:53.260
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

09:53.260 --> 09:56.420
you feel annoyance and disgust at them,

09:56.420 --> 09:58.380
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.420
So these are actually two very different

10:00.420 --> 10:04.420
emotional responses, vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.260
We call both feelings cringe,

10:06.260 --> 10:08.220
not because they're similar feelings,

10:08.220 --> 10:09.820
but because they're responses

10:09.820 --> 10:11.780
to the same type of situation,

10:11.780 --> 10:14.380
people lacking self-awareness embarrassing themselves

10:14.380 --> 10:15.580
without realizing it.

10:15.580 --> 10:19.020
Now embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

10:19.020 --> 10:21.020
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.460
So why are we so fascinated by content

10:23.460 --> 10:25.020
that makes us feel this way?

10:25.020 --> 10:26.540
Why do these cringe subreddits

10:26.540 --> 10:28.460
have more than a million members?

10:28.460 --> 10:31.340
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos

10:31.340 --> 10:33.180
so popular on YouTube?

10:33.180 --> 10:36.420
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

10:36.420 --> 10:37.900
Well, I think the answer to that question

10:37.900 --> 10:39.620
depends on whether we're cringing

10:39.620 --> 10:41.900
compassionately or contemptuously.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.540
When I read that Ask Reddit thread

10:43.540 --> 10:45.660
where all the people share their cringe stories,

10:45.660 --> 10:47.300
I cringe compassionately.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.460
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

10:50.460 --> 10:53.580
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity

10:53.580 --> 10:55.180
and camaraderie with them.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.980
I recognize myself in them,

10:56.980 --> 10:59.500
and I'm reassured to hear that other people

10:59.500 --> 11:02.140
are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.540
I'm not the only one who cringes at my past

11:04.540 --> 11:06.060
or at videos of myself.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.740
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

11:07.740 --> 11:10.580
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.900
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

11:12.900 --> 11:15.580
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.660
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong thing sometimes,

11:18.660 --> 11:21.660
that we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion

11:21.660 --> 11:23.460
only to later educate ourselves

11:23.460 --> 11:26.700
and realize how ignorant and wrong we were,

11:26.700 --> 11:28.340
that we've all tried to present ourselves

11:28.340 --> 11:33.060
as cool and likable, as beautiful and talented and badass,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.460
only to totally miss the mark

11:34.460 --> 11:36.260
and completely embarrass ourselves.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.860
And laughing at our shared absurdity, our insecurity,

11:39.860 --> 11:43.740
our ridiculous pretenses, it makes us feel less alone.

11:43.740 --> 11:44.780
Now this is all, of course,

11:44.780 --> 11:47.260
assuming that we're cringing compassionately.

11:47.260 --> 11:51.660
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet

11:51.660 --> 11:53.580
does not encourage compassion.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.580
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact

11:55.580 --> 11:59.300
because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.220
This is the 21st century, right?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.820
Pillories and freak shows and public floggings,

12:04.820 --> 12:08.060
these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?

12:08.060 --> 12:10.180
Surely no one on the internet would ever

12:10.180 --> 12:14.180
entertain themselves by humiliating people, right?

12:14.180 --> 12:18.620
We've got maniacs!

12:18.620 --> 12:20.060
We've got wackadoos!

12:20.060 --> 12:22.980
We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs!

12:22.980 --> 12:26.380
Come see sexual deviants on display!

12:26.380 --> 12:29.420
That's right, folks, we've got cackling perverts

12:29.420 --> 12:30.740
of every denomination.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.500
Come see the panty sniffer!

12:32.500 --> 12:35.780
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings!

12:35.780 --> 12:37.420
Come see the skeleton girl!

12:37.420 --> 12:39.380
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days!

12:39.380 --> 12:43.580
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians!

12:43.580 --> 12:45.580
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

12:45.580 --> 12:49.340
Half man, half woman, all freak.

12:50.340 --> 12:54.020
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.060
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.420
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture,

12:59.420 --> 13:02.380
and by that I mean there's whole channels making content

13:02.380 --> 13:04.780
that centers the experience of cringing.

13:04.780 --> 13:08.100
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,

13:08.100 --> 13:12.060
including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

13:12.060 --> 13:15.020
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

13:15.020 --> 13:18.180
which was the heyday of the Feminist Cringe Compilation,

13:18.180 --> 13:21.580
or SJW Cringe Compilation, remember those?

13:21.580 --> 13:23.860
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

13:23.860 --> 13:27.060
but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated

13:27.060 --> 13:29.540
with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.640
His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.220
which means he would play someone else's content,

13:35.220 --> 13:38.900
then pause it to rant and voiceover about how cringe it is.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.580
♪ No makeup with some sweatpants ♪

13:40.580 --> 13:43.900
Oh my God, it's so fucking bad!

13:43.900 --> 13:45.540
He looks like he's gender fluid,

13:45.540 --> 13:47.380
he looks like a fucking lesbian!

13:47.380 --> 13:51.340
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

13:51.340 --> 13:54.060
and it was picked up by a rational herd

13:54.060 --> 13:56.940
of skeptical beasts and free-thinking tuxedos.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.340
What even is this thing?

13:58.340 --> 14:00.540
It must be one of the 76 genders.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.500
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.340
Sorry my dudes, you are on the cringe side of history.

14:06.340 --> 14:10.180
Obviously there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.240
The logical antelope isn't inviting you

14:12.240 --> 14:14.540
to foster a shared sense of humanity

14:14.540 --> 14:16.140
by recognizing your own weakness

14:16.140 --> 14:18.300
and the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.220
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.660
Here's a YouTube video titled

14:22.660 --> 14:25.100
Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.180
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video

14:27.180 --> 14:30.640
of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways,

14:30.640 --> 14:31.700
but it isn't.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.260
It's literally just a compilation

14:33.260 --> 14:34.980
of fat people doing things.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.220
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.820
Is this cringe?

14:38.820 --> 14:40.460
What is cringe about it?

14:40.460 --> 14:42.000
Earlier we defined cringe

14:42.000 --> 14:44.740
as either vicarious embarrassment or contempt

14:44.740 --> 14:46.180
for someone who lacks awareness

14:46.180 --> 14:47.740
about the way others are perceiving them.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.980
But in this video of a swimming fat woman,

14:49.980 --> 14:51.180
there's no context,

14:51.180 --> 14:53.780
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.180
And we certainly don't know

14:55.180 --> 14:57.900
whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.260
If there is an interview where she talks

14:59.260 --> 15:00.740
about how she looks like a supermodel

15:00.740 --> 15:02.700
or if she tried to Photoshop herself

15:02.700 --> 15:04.260
to look like a size four,

15:04.260 --> 15:06.040
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.380
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.460
She's just existing in water.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.540
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.020
Presumably something along the lines of,

15:17.020 --> 15:19.900
ew, fat people, gross.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.020
It's literally just disgust, right?

15:22.020 --> 15:24.700
Disgust and contempt for a type of person,

15:24.700 --> 15:25.860
a type of body.

15:25.860 --> 15:27.460
Here's another cringe compilation.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.500
This one titled gender-fluid non-binary cringe.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.180
And we're watching a young teenager

15:32.180 --> 15:34.020
discuss their plans to start vlogging

15:34.020 --> 15:36.140
about their gender-fluid identity.

15:36.140 --> 15:38.060
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying

15:38.060 --> 15:43.060
because gender-fluid people just aren't accepted.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.380
Yeah, apparently not.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.780
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this

15:47.780 --> 15:49.460
in a cringe compilation,

15:49.460 --> 15:51.540
it seems that the person in this video

15:51.540 --> 15:54.020
was dead on about how people would perceive them.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.940
But despite that self-awareness,

15:55.940 --> 15:57.780
we're being invited to cringe

15:57.780 --> 16:01.020
because I guess being gender-fluid,

16:01.020 --> 16:04.780
like being fat, is cringe in and of itself.

16:04.780 --> 16:08.180
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

16:08.180 --> 16:10.960
This is not real cringe, I wanna say.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.920
Cringe has to involve a clash

16:12.920 --> 16:15.640
between self-perception and perception by others.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.140
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt

16:19.140 --> 16:21.720
is so widespread that there's really no point

16:21.720 --> 16:22.960
in objecting to it.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.500
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.480
one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

16:27.480 --> 16:30.640
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,

16:30.640 --> 16:34.760
a furry, a couple bronies, a fedora tipper.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.680
These are subcultures associated

16:36.680 --> 16:38.880
with nerdy social outcasts.

16:38.880 --> 16:42.400
They're types of people who are widely ridiculed online.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.380
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together

16:45.380 --> 16:48.200
of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.040
Bronies, furries, otaku, weebs, incels,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.840
neckbeards, fedora tippers, gamers, TikTok teens,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.400
not-like-other-girls girls, fanfic writers,

16:58.400 --> 17:01.720
beat poets, SGWs, feminists, magas,

17:01.720 --> 17:03.680
trans people, non-binary people,

17:03.680 --> 17:06.760
transtrenders, queer AFAB ukulele players,

17:06.760 --> 17:08.620
autistic people, fat people,

17:08.620 --> 17:11.120
the mentally ill, and the mentally disabled.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.840
Now I'm searching for some thread

17:12.840 --> 17:14.640
that all these groups have in common,

17:14.640 --> 17:16.880
and a handful of themes do jump out.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.340
Deviancy, whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

17:20.340 --> 17:24.080
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.200
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.000
Obsessive interest in unconventional hobbies.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.440
Low social status.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.700
It's pretty easy to wind up

17:32.700 --> 17:34.560
in the cringe category these days.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.620
If you add up all the groups on this list,

17:37.480 --> 17:39.340
I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.140
It includes me three or four times.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.500
I'm of course a fedora tipping,

17:43.500 --> 17:45.980
queer AFAB ukulele playing TikTok teen.

17:45.980 --> 17:48.020
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe

17:48.020 --> 17:52.740
and try to be like compassionate or whatever?

17:52.740 --> 17:53.700
Fuck no.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.980
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

17:56.980 --> 18:00.620
Oh no, this is social reject battle royale.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.420
Clearly, contemptuous cringing

18:02.420 --> 18:04.700
is rewarding to people in some way,

18:04.700 --> 18:08.020
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.020
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe

18:10.020 --> 18:11.460
in internet politics,

18:11.460 --> 18:14.860
where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

18:14.860 --> 18:18.220
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

18:18.220 --> 18:22.060
you couldn't escape clips of this woman known as Big Red,

18:22.060 --> 18:24.980
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

18:24.980 --> 18:27.020
and read off a list of feminist theses

18:27.020 --> 18:28.580
while swearing profusely.

18:28.580 --> 18:32.140
It's part of patriarchy, part of patriarchy.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.460
I don't know if you're noticing a theme, patriarchy.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.260
I'm reading, fuck face.

18:36.260 --> 18:39.660
Mr. Entitled, Mr. Ego, patriarchy, fuck face.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.140
She's one of these people who generates memeable phrases

18:42.140 --> 18:43.340
at an amazing rate.

18:43.340 --> 18:45.200
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.100
but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.980
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

18:50.980 --> 18:52.820
reaction videos, remixes,

18:52.820 --> 18:55.260
and even anti-feminist video essays.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.540
Often Big Red was framed as like the feminist,

18:58.540 --> 19:00.460
the mascot of feminism,

19:00.460 --> 19:03.620
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists,

19:03.620 --> 19:04.860
which is highly dishonest

19:04.860 --> 19:07.420
considering she's not even a high-profile activist

19:07.420 --> 19:08.260
or thinker.

19:08.260 --> 19:09.820
She was literally some random woman

19:09.820 --> 19:11.140
on the streets of Toronto.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.500
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

19:13.500 --> 19:16.060
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand

19:16.060 --> 19:18.860
on this random woman who, we were told,

19:18.860 --> 19:21.940
exemplified feminism in its purest form.

19:21.940 --> 19:24.660
I call this strategy mascotization,

19:24.660 --> 19:27.340
the construction of a straw man nemesis.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.100
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

19:30.100 --> 19:32.340
and you appoint them the mascot

19:32.340 --> 19:34.180
of an opposing political team.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.260
It's very simple, but very effective.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.780
And it's best paired with memification.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.540
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

19:41.540 --> 19:43.620
you freeze it, and you declare

19:43.620 --> 19:46.100
that that moment fully represents a person.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.180
Then, through mascotization,

19:48.180 --> 19:50.500
you declare that this memified person

19:50.500 --> 19:52.820
represents an entire group or movement.

19:52.820 --> 19:56.300
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,

19:56.300 --> 19:58.140
You're fucking a white male!

19:58.140 --> 20:00.140
Memified as AIDS Skrillex,

20:00.140 --> 20:01.460
and this protester,

20:01.460 --> 20:03.660
Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!

20:03.660 --> 20:05.620
Can't you hate me? I'm a killer!

20:05.620 --> 20:07.940
who was memified as Drigglypuff.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.260
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness

20:10.260 --> 20:12.300
of beta new male cuckoldry

20:12.300 --> 20:16.220
and the hysteria of social justice crybullies, respectively.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.540
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

20:19.540 --> 20:20.940
about whom hundreds of hours

20:20.940 --> 20:23.460
of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.900
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

20:25.900 --> 20:29.740
as like this fake gamer girl, this pleb-tier casual,

20:29.740 --> 20:32.260
throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.100
But other times,

20:33.100 --> 20:35.460
it was almost a super-villainous caricature,

20:35.460 --> 20:38.900
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype

20:38.900 --> 20:40.980
threatening to confiscate your video games

20:40.980 --> 20:42.860
and engulf you in her eunuch abyss.

20:42.860 --> 20:45.620
Now, it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies

20:45.620 --> 20:48.020
as super-villainous is effective,

20:48.020 --> 20:50.560
though it comes at the risk of backfiring

20:50.560 --> 20:53.660
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

20:53.660 --> 20:55.400
a little too badass.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.700
But the subtler strategy of symbolizing

20:57.700 --> 21:00.220
your political enemies not with an evil,

21:00.220 --> 21:02.460
but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

21:02.460 --> 21:04.900
works because it connects with a wide audience

21:04.900 --> 21:06.980
in an intense, emotional way.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.260
Most people have a primal terror

21:09.260 --> 21:11.660
of becoming the target of public ridicule.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.940
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.860
it's much safer to take the side

21:15.860 --> 21:17.660
of the people doing the laughing

21:17.660 --> 21:20.440
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.620
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

21:23.620 --> 21:27.280
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

21:27.280 --> 21:30.720
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

21:30.720 --> 21:33.360
is that our brains want us to learn

21:33.360 --> 21:35.680
how to avoid being laughed at.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.240
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

21:39.240 --> 21:41.440
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

21:41.440 --> 21:45.080
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

21:45.080 --> 21:48.400
Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.040
This is a powerful tool for anyone

21:50.040 --> 21:52.200
who wants to control human behavior.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.120
It's why public humiliation has, in many societies,

21:55.120 --> 21:56.860
been a punishment for criminals.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.660
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory,

21:59.660 --> 22:02.500
at the whipping post, you see the mob jeering

22:02.500 --> 22:04.340
and throwing rotten vegetables,

22:04.340 --> 22:06.060
and it sends a powerful message.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.840
Don't do whatever that guy did.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.340
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness

22:10.340 --> 22:13.260
about the fact that the fear of public humiliation

22:13.260 --> 22:15.720
rules us like it's the 17th century.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.860
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks,

22:18.860 --> 22:21.220
but instead, there's teenage YouTubers

22:21.220 --> 22:23.060
making cringe reaction videos.

22:23.060 --> 22:24.980
There's ex-boyfriends revenge-posting

22:24.980 --> 22:26.300
their girlfriends' nudes.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.180
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming

22:29.180 --> 22:32.100
just about anyone for alleged breaches of wokeness.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.460
Public humiliation is a powerful force,

22:34.460 --> 22:38.460
and it's usually, it's not a good force,

22:38.460 --> 22:40.500
but there are some rare exceptions.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.280
Back in the Gamergate era, Gamergate itself, of course,

22:43.280 --> 22:45.300
being a study in public humiliation,

22:45.300 --> 22:47.740
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

22:47.740 --> 22:50.260
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated

22:50.260 --> 22:51.780
by anti-feminism.

22:51.780 --> 22:54.420
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,

22:54.420 --> 22:57.420
and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers

22:57.420 --> 22:59.640
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.000
What I see as one of the turning points

23:02.000 --> 23:05.420
in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days

23:05.420 --> 23:07.980
to the left-tube world of today

23:07.980 --> 23:09.980
was a handful of videos uploaded

23:09.980 --> 23:12.540
by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,

23:12.540 --> 23:15.140
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual

23:15.140 --> 23:17.100
called Davis Aurini.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.260
Come on, Davis, we have to,

23:18.260 --> 23:19.660
no, stop lecturing me about ethics,

23:19.660 --> 23:20.500
we have to get out of here,

23:20.500 --> 23:23.740
and can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?

23:23.780 --> 23:24.940
In his YouTube videos,

23:24.940 --> 23:27.980
Davis would pontificate about the wickedness of women

23:27.980 --> 23:29.980
while posing in front of a toy skull

23:29.980 --> 23:33.040
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

23:35.300 --> 23:38.140
Men of the West, women in our culture

23:38.140 --> 23:41.700
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.140
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

23:45.340 --> 23:47.580
I would start with the premise

23:47.580 --> 23:50.340
that all women are whores.

23:54.660 --> 23:59.660
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views,

24:00.340 --> 24:02.220
and a fairly positive response

24:02.220 --> 24:04.700
even from a mostly male gamer audience,

24:04.700 --> 24:07.540
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.340
Why did these videos work with this audience

24:10.340 --> 24:12.060
where so many others didn't?

24:12.060 --> 24:13.380
Well, I think it's because Harry

24:13.380 --> 24:15.940
didn't moralistically call out Davis

24:15.940 --> 24:18.900
for being problematic or misogynistic.

24:18.900 --> 24:22.180
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

24:22.180 --> 24:25.160
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.780
And Davis was a perfect target

24:26.780 --> 24:29.620
because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.620
He had no self-awareness about the fact

24:31.620 --> 24:34.580
that pretty much everyone saw through his absurd posturing

24:34.580 --> 24:36.700
as a badass tough guy by day,

24:36.700 --> 24:39.060
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.420
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

24:42.420 --> 24:45.100
I've spoken to men and boys who've told me

24:45.100 --> 24:47.060
that Harry's videos inspired

24:47.060 --> 24:49.620
the beginning of a feminist awakening in them,

24:49.660 --> 24:52.380
not just because they cringed at Davis Arrini,

24:52.380 --> 24:54.740
but also because they recognized

24:54.740 --> 24:57.340
a little bit of Davis in themselves,

24:57.340 --> 24:59.200
and they cringed at that too.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.500
Recognizing part of yourself in a cringe-worthy person

25:02.500 --> 25:05.780
induces self-cringe, which can motivate you

25:05.780 --> 25:07.980
to change your behavior, your beliefs,

25:07.980 --> 25:10.240
or even your own self-concept.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.220
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

25:13.220 --> 25:16.140
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.060
namely the fedora tipper,

25:18.060 --> 25:21.220
basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader

25:21.220 --> 25:23.060
for traditional masculinity,

25:23.060 --> 25:25.220
but who's basically just a pasty nerd

25:25.220 --> 25:26.420
who can't relate to women.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.860
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

25:28.860 --> 25:31.260
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments

25:31.260 --> 25:33.660
so frequently that I would classify him

25:33.660 --> 25:36.860
as what the internet calls a lolcow.

25:36.860 --> 25:39.100
Lolcow is old 4chan lingo.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.540
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric

25:41.540 --> 25:45.020
or foolish behavior can be milked for lols.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.300
Milking in this context can mean

25:47.300 --> 25:50.500
simply watching a lolcow's behavior and laughing at them,

25:50.500 --> 25:52.360
or it can mean making reaction videos

25:52.360 --> 25:53.640
where you make fun of them,

25:53.640 --> 25:57.300
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

25:57.300 --> 25:59.940
to get a response that you find entertaining.

25:59.940 --> 26:02.100
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

26:02.100 --> 26:04.300
or my old videos about the Golden One,

26:04.300 --> 26:07.820
as lolcow milking content with a political angle.

26:07.820 --> 26:10.300
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.940
an argument from cringe,

26:11.940 --> 26:13.900
with the aim of convincing people,

26:13.900 --> 26:16.660
don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs,

26:16.660 --> 26:19.660
but also, and I'll just speak for myself here,

26:19.660 --> 26:23.860
I am, at the end of the day, an entertainer,

26:23.860 --> 26:25.620
and I wanted people to laugh.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.420
There doesn't need to be a political agenda

26:27.420 --> 26:30.960
behind milking lolcows, in fact, usually, there isn't.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.780
The purest example of a lolcow I can think of

26:33.780 --> 26:36.160
is actually someone from way before the internet,

26:36.160 --> 26:38.340
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

26:38.340 --> 26:42.300
Jenkins, or Lady Florence, as she liked to be called,

26:42.340 --> 26:45.220
was an American soprano who attracted a cult following

26:45.220 --> 26:48.500
in New York City during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s,

26:48.500 --> 26:50.580
due to her being such a terrible singer

26:50.580 --> 26:54.260
that people went to her concerts essentially for the lols.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.340
She was described as the world's worst opera singer.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.960
No one, before or since, has succeeded

26:59.960 --> 27:02.420
in liberating themselves quite so completely

27:02.420 --> 27:04.820
from the shackles of musical notation.

27:04.820 --> 27:07.840
Behold this fucking camp queen.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.520
Oh, we have no choice but to stan.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.400
Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.800
Ah!

27:13.800 --> 27:15.160
Ah!

27:15.160 --> 27:16.000
Ah!

27:17.200 --> 27:18.040
Ah!

27:18.040 --> 27:18.860
Cringe.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.840
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.240
the William Hung of her age.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.040
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

27:26.040 --> 27:29.640
until 1944, when she was 76 years old

27:29.640 --> 27:32.200
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

27:32.200 --> 27:34.500
to which newspaper critics showed up.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.720
The next morning, the New York Sun reported,

27:36.760 --> 27:39.040
much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

27:39.040 --> 27:42.040
in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was

27:42.040 --> 27:43.680
from its proper elevation,

27:43.680 --> 27:46.400
the more the audience laughed and applauded.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.760
And five days later, she had a heart attack and died.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.920
I find something very touching about this story.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.840
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

27:53.840 --> 27:55.440
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

27:55.440 --> 27:59.160
but I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.400
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty

28:01.400 --> 28:04.040
of Simon Cowell, at least he tries to stop these people

28:04.040 --> 28:05.440
before things get out of hand.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.480
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings

28:07.480 --> 28:08.560
about a lolcow.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.160
Like, yes, this is hilarious, but on the other hand,

28:12.160 --> 28:13.880
doth not a lolcow bleed?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.720
On some level, we know it's wrong

28:15.720 --> 28:18.040
to entertain ourselves this way,

28:18.040 --> 28:19.560
but on the other hand,

28:19.560 --> 28:22.200
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.960
There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,

28:24.960 --> 28:27.600
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature

28:27.600 --> 28:28.720
by Richard Smith.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.040
Schadenfreude is of course the pleasure we take

28:31.040 --> 28:32.480
in other people's misery,

28:32.480 --> 28:34.800
and Smith argues that we experience it

28:34.800 --> 28:37.560
because psychologically, we gain something

28:37.560 --> 28:38.880
when other people lose.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.400
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

28:41.400 --> 28:43.720
by comparing ourselves to other people,

28:43.720 --> 28:46.480
so we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

28:46.480 --> 28:49.040
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

28:49.040 --> 28:51.760
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

28:51.760 --> 28:55.160
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.880
Maybe I'm not perfect, but at least I'm not this lolcow.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.600
And we also get a boost when people who are socially

29:01.600 --> 29:05.800
above us, whom we envy, get brought down a peg.

29:05.800 --> 29:09.880
James Charles' canceled party lolol.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.920
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

29:12.920 --> 29:15.120
for just a huge percentage of the things

29:15.120 --> 29:17.280
that happen on YouTube.com.

29:17.280 --> 29:21.240
Smith uses the word humilitainment for this type of media,

29:21.240 --> 29:23.520
like reality TV shows designed to produce

29:23.520 --> 29:25.800
spectacular moments of embarrassment.

29:25.800 --> 29:29.000
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.280
or some kind of carnival sideshow.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.280
Take a look around you.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.400
We have Eugenia Cooney, a YouTuber who,

29:35.400 --> 29:37.000
at the time I'm making this video,

29:37.000 --> 29:38.800
remains apparently in total denial

29:38.800 --> 29:41.440
about her eating disorder and continues to make videos

29:41.440 --> 29:43.880
modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.600
We have Wings of Redemption, a bad-tempered gamer

29:46.600 --> 29:49.080
who for a long time was essentially confined

29:49.080 --> 29:51.320
by poverty, obesity, and depression

29:51.320 --> 29:53.160
to streaming video games all day

29:53.160 --> 29:55.800
to an audience of trolls that enjoyed tormenting him.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.600
We have Onision, a habitual allege,

29:59.600 --> 30:01.600
abuser of women and teenage girls,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.960
who earlier this year essentially performed

30:03.960 --> 30:06.240
his own mental breakdown on YouTube

30:06.240 --> 30:09.080
after Patreon banned him for doxing an accuser.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.400
I love kombucha!

30:12.400 --> 30:15.040
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

30:15.040 --> 30:16.620
Whose idea was it to give hundreds

30:16.620 --> 30:20.040
of pathological narcissists access to video equipment?

30:20.040 --> 30:23.160
What kind of sick social experiment are we living in?

30:23.160 --> 30:26.040
And the viewers are no better than the performers.

30:26.040 --> 30:29.520
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs makes me sick.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.920
Oh, you people love nothing more

30:31.920 --> 30:34.720
than to watch one of us poor, helpless egomaniacs

30:34.720 --> 30:37.080
completely lose our minds live on camera.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.680
Is this what you want, huh?

30:38.680 --> 30:43.080
Is this what, you wanna total meltdown?

30:43.080 --> 30:45.480
You know, as a creator, you have to be aware

30:45.480 --> 30:47.800
that you're a circus performer,

30:47.800 --> 30:50.940
and the crowd may in fact be more entertained

30:50.940 --> 30:53.660
if you fall from the trapeze and get eaten by the tigers.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.760
Online media today is full of Lady Florences,

30:56.760 --> 30:59.280
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

31:00.040 --> 31:03.420
To be clear, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

31:03.420 --> 31:04.920
with indulging now and then

31:04.920 --> 31:06.720
in a little bit of light contempt.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.240
Cringing at Davis or Rini or bad American Idol auditions

31:10.240 --> 31:13.460
seems pretty harmless, but it can be taken too far,

31:13.460 --> 31:16.760
and there's no better case study of taking it too far

31:16.760 --> 31:21.520
than the cult following of one Christine Weston Chandler.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.840
If you don't know what's coming,

31:22.840 --> 31:24.320
you might wanna strap in, gorge,

31:24.320 --> 31:26.880
because this is coconuts.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.000
It's bananas.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.600
It's a full fruit salad.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.640
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

31:32.600 --> 31:35.760
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

31:35.760 --> 31:38.840
more commonly known on the internet as Chris-Chan,

31:38.840 --> 31:43.720
is the victim of what is quite possibly

31:43.720 --> 31:46.440
the longest-running and most obsessive

31:46.440 --> 31:49.000
internet trolling saga of all time.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.880
She's the lolcow of lolcows.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.880
Hello, everybody, this is Christine Chandler

31:53.880 --> 31:56.020
coming to you live from home once again.

31:56.020 --> 31:58.060
Chandler is an autistic trans woman,

31:58.060 --> 32:00.540
and yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

32:00.540 --> 32:02.580
which I paused to explain

32:02.580 --> 32:04.420
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

32:04.420 --> 32:06.660
actually take her transition seriously.

32:06.660 --> 32:08.060
Most people seem to regard it

32:08.060 --> 32:10.460
as simply another absurd symptom

32:10.460 --> 32:12.300
of her hilarious mental condition.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.660
In fact, a bunch of trans people

32:13.660 --> 32:15.900
will probably get real salty with me

32:15.900 --> 32:18.500
for making trans people look bad

32:18.500 --> 32:21.020
by including Chris-Chan in our, oh,

32:21.020 --> 32:24.500
our very prestigious and exclusive club.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.340
Oh, please.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.660
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.740
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.100
God, how did trannies get so snobbish?

32:34.100 --> 32:37.420
Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?

32:37.420 --> 32:40.660
I don't know, and I don't care.

32:40.660 --> 32:43.220
If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,

32:43.220 --> 32:45.260
I for one support her journey.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.300
But it doesn't matter.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.180
The relevant thing about Chris-Chan is not Chris-Chan.

32:49.180 --> 32:52.340
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

32:52.340 --> 32:54.740
nearly every aspect of her life

32:54.740 --> 32:57.380
has been obsessively archived online

32:57.380 --> 33:01.540
by thousands of voyeurs known as Christorians.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.980
Chancellor first acquired this anti-fandom

33:03.980 --> 33:07.720
several internet centuries ago, back in 2007,

33:07.720 --> 33:11.620
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,

33:11.620 --> 33:15.340
a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.640
The comic is set in Quickville,

33:17.640 --> 33:20.300
CWC being Chris-Chan's initials.

33:20.300 --> 33:22.260
The protagonist is a self-insert

33:23.080 --> 33:25.820
who references Chandler's real-life quote, love quest

33:25.820 --> 33:28.340
to find a quote, boyfriend-free girl,

33:28.340 --> 33:32.140
which apparently involved posting bizarre attraction signs

33:32.140 --> 33:33.940
around her community college.

33:33.940 --> 33:36.340
For this story to make sense, you have to keep in mind

33:36.340 --> 33:40.580
that Chandler identified and presented as male until 2015.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.260
So these trolls saw her as like,

33:43.260 --> 33:46.860
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

33:46.860 --> 33:48.740
Just to give you a feel for this person,

33:48.740 --> 33:50.740
here's Christine in 2018,

33:50.740 --> 33:53.460
holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait,

33:53.460 --> 33:54.980
note the Sonichu medallions.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.720
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

33:56.720 --> 33:58.580
and here she is in recent years,

33:58.580 --> 34:01.720
giving us a full BronyCon eleganza.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.180
Pegasister snapped.

34:03.180 --> 34:05.820
Basically, she's the entire Cringetopia subreddit

34:05.820 --> 34:07.660
condensed into a single person.

34:07.660 --> 34:10.340
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,

34:10.340 --> 34:11.820
because of course they did,

34:11.820 --> 34:13.420
and they began tormenting her

34:13.420 --> 34:16.060
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

34:16.060 --> 34:18.780
posting candid photos of her, et cetera.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.580
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

34:21.420 --> 34:22.700
which of course encouraged them more,

34:22.700 --> 34:24.980
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.100
They hacked her accounts,

34:26.100 --> 34:28.420
or tricked her into giving out passwords,

34:28.420 --> 34:30.460
they posted all her emails online,

34:30.460 --> 34:33.060
they showed up in person and photographed her house,

34:33.060 --> 34:34.220
they called her parents,

34:34.220 --> 34:38.300
posing as friends, psychiatrists, journalists, employers,

34:38.300 --> 34:40.420
in order to extract as much information

34:40.420 --> 34:41.620
about her as possible.

34:41.620 --> 34:44.280
And of course, they contacted Chandler herself,

34:44.280 --> 34:46.380
which was very rewarding for trolls,

34:46.380 --> 34:48.300
because she has no filter,

34:48.300 --> 34:50.060
and was very naive and trusting.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.020
So she was very willing to divulge,

34:52.020 --> 34:54.300
or easily manipulated into divulging,

34:54.300 --> 34:56.900
mortifying information about herself.

34:56.900 --> 35:00.580
Sexual, psychological, scatological,

35:00.580 --> 35:03.180
there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.900
For all the information they gathered,

35:04.900 --> 35:08.060
the trolls created a wiki, called the Quickie,

35:08.060 --> 35:12.440
devoted to the obsessive compiling of all Chris-Chan data.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.620
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

35:15.620 --> 35:17.660
entire articles about all members

35:17.660 --> 35:19.860
of her immediate and extended family,

35:20.620 --> 35:22.540
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked

35:22.540 --> 35:25.900
into sending them, and that's only the beginning.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.280
In their more grandiose moods,

35:28.280 --> 35:31.620
the Christorians have speculated that Chris-Chan

35:31.620 --> 35:35.260
is the most documented life in all human history,

35:35.260 --> 35:39.060
comparing their social experitainment to the Truman Show.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.880
It's a level of obsession that surpasses

35:41.880 --> 35:44.660
the wildest excesses of Stan culture.

35:44.660 --> 35:48.340
It's a gaze into the abyss that does not blink.

35:49.340 --> 35:53.860
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

35:53.860 --> 35:57.340
or on one occasion, sex workers, to the Chandler household.

35:57.340 --> 36:00.240
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates

36:00.240 --> 36:03.340
with Chris-Chan, of course, secretly wearing wires

36:03.340 --> 36:05.080
to record their conversations.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.020
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

36:08.020 --> 36:12.180
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

36:12.180 --> 36:15.900
These things must be archived, don't you understand?

36:15.900 --> 36:18.380
Chris-Chan must be documented.

36:18.380 --> 36:21.580
The absolute low point came when some trolls

36:21.580 --> 36:26.580
encouraged a 13-year-old boy to pose as a 19-year-old girl

36:26.660 --> 36:29.540
and have phone sex with Chris-Chan and record it.

36:29.540 --> 36:32.780
In other words, they groomed a child

36:32.780 --> 36:36.860
to deceive an autistic person into performing sex acts

36:36.860 --> 36:38.340
for their entertainment.

36:38.340 --> 36:40.900
Now, to contemporary Christorians,

36:40.900 --> 36:44.400
this sort of sadistic interference in Christine's life

36:44.400 --> 36:45.460
is frowned upon.

36:45.980 --> 36:47.260
Not so much because it's immoral,

36:47.260 --> 36:50.940
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

36:50.940 --> 36:52.500
a bit attention-seeking.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.100
No, to the sophisticated Christorian,

36:56.100 --> 36:59.460
the real pleasure in all this is supposed to lie

36:59.460 --> 37:04.460
in quietly spectating, savoring the fine notes of cringe.

37:04.860 --> 37:07.380
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

37:07.380 --> 37:08.740
on the morality of all this.

37:08.740 --> 37:12.580
The real question to me is why?

37:12.580 --> 37:16.180
Why do thousands of people have a morbid obsession

37:16.180 --> 37:17.980
with Christine Chandler?

37:17.980 --> 37:19.740
And yes, it is an obsession.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.140
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

37:22.140 --> 37:26.280
personal investment in this, the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

37:26.280 --> 37:29.140
one of very few Christorians with the audacity

37:29.140 --> 37:33.500
to show his face, has been working for more than two years

37:33.500 --> 37:38.020
to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series

37:38.020 --> 37:40.420
about the life of Chris-Chan.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.100
Gino has completed 36 episodes so far,

37:43.100 --> 37:45.620
and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

37:45.620 --> 37:49.460
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

37:49.460 --> 37:53.060
about the life of what is essentially a random stranger.

37:53.060 --> 37:55.900
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.220
I'll call it morbid cringe,

37:58.220 --> 38:00.420
defined as an obsessive and addictive

38:00.420 --> 38:04.900
contemptuous fascination with a particular person or group.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.380
Why does morbid cringe happen?

38:07.380 --> 38:08.940
Well, I've spent some time

38:08.940 --> 38:12.100
poring over Christorians' conversations with each other,

38:12.100 --> 38:14.740
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

38:14.740 --> 38:16.340
and this is what I've found.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.580
The first thing they'll tell you

38:17.580 --> 38:20.140
is that they just think it's funny and entertaining,

38:20.140 --> 38:22.520
that Christine's strange life and mind

38:22.520 --> 38:25.420
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity,

38:25.420 --> 38:27.340
and I'm sure that's true.

38:27.340 --> 38:30.020
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

38:30.020 --> 38:31.740
and morbidly interesting.

38:31.740 --> 38:35.540
Why fixate on this particular person?

38:35.540 --> 38:38.540
Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance

38:38.540 --> 38:41.820
that there's someone out there worse than them.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.600
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

38:44.600 --> 38:48.200
but at least this defenseless punching bag called Chris-chan

38:48.200 --> 38:51.460
is here for them to assert their superiority over.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.500
It's pretty much common knowledge

38:53.500 --> 38:55.280
that a lot of Christorians,

38:55.280 --> 38:57.680
including some of the most vocal haters,

38:57.680 --> 38:59.620
are autistic themselves.

38:59.620 --> 39:03.660
And a frequent justification given for trolling Chris-chan

39:03.660 --> 39:06.980
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

39:06.980 --> 39:09.980
In recent years, there's also been a small contingent

39:09.980 --> 39:14.180
of transgender trolls who are likewise prone to say,

39:14.180 --> 39:16.540
he's not a real transgender like me

39:16.540 --> 39:19.020
and he's making us all look bad.

39:20.180 --> 39:24.360
Oh yeah, because people who troll Chris-chan,

39:25.260 --> 39:27.620
you guys look amazing.

39:27.620 --> 39:31.420
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

39:31.420 --> 39:36.180
about why trolling Chandler is justified, righteous even,

39:36.180 --> 39:41.020
because at the end of the day, trolls are people too.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.660
And a lot of them actually do

39:42.660 --> 39:44.980
have a guilty conscience about this,

39:44.980 --> 39:47.620
which they suppress by insisting

39:47.620 --> 39:50.380
that Chris-chan is a horrible person

39:50.380 --> 39:52.380
who deserves to be tormented.

39:52.380 --> 39:54.380
But trolls who protest too much

39:54.380 --> 39:56.660
about the evils of Chris-chan,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.940
and therefore reveal the excess

39:58.940 --> 40:01.400
of their emotional investment in this,

40:01.400 --> 40:04.500
are known in the community as A-logs.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.700
A-log is the name of a troll

40:06.700 --> 40:09.260
who attracted the ire of other trolls

40:09.260 --> 40:12.140
by ranting about Chris-chan's crimes,

40:12.140 --> 40:14.300
comparing her to Hitler,

40:14.300 --> 40:18.600
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.800
Among the trolls, this kind of behavior

40:20.800 --> 40:23.540
is considered an embarrassment to all of them

40:23.540 --> 40:27.100
because they want to feel like they're just cruelly

40:27.100 --> 40:30.380
and casually toying with this person.

40:30.380 --> 40:33.300
You know, just for laughs.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.260
Not a big deal.

40:35.260 --> 40:40.260
This is all perfectly healthy, and normal, and fine.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.080
It's fine.

40:44.300 --> 40:47.660
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

40:47.660 --> 40:51.020
because it was obvious that his Chris-chan obsession

40:51.020 --> 40:55.380
wasn't healthy, or normal, or fine.

40:55.380 --> 40:57.380
So the other trolls turned on A-log,

40:57.380 --> 40:59.900
and they made him into Chris-chan 2.0,

40:59.900 --> 41:01.820
and they uncovered his autism,

41:01.820 --> 41:03.740
and his furry porn collection,

41:03.740 --> 41:06.520
and his cringy, erotic fan fiction.

41:06.520 --> 41:10.020
So why would someone as similar to Chris-chan as A-log

41:10.020 --> 41:11.820
obsessively hate on her?

41:11.820 --> 41:13.980
Well, there's two explanations.

41:13.980 --> 41:16.300
One is troll-shielding.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.900
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-chan

41:19.900 --> 41:22.000
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

41:22.000 --> 41:25.900
in order to protect himself from being targeted by trolls.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.160
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

41:29.160 --> 41:31.900
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.440
Obviously, this did not work.

41:34.440 --> 41:38.400
The other explanation is that A-log saw himself

41:38.400 --> 41:40.480
reflected in Chris-chan,

41:40.480 --> 41:43.680
and sort of projected his own shame

41:43.680 --> 41:46.200
and self-contempt onto her.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.680
A-log hated Chris-chan because he saw part of himself

41:49.680 --> 41:53.240
in her, and the other trolls hated A-log

41:53.240 --> 41:56.300
because they saw part of themselves in him.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.640
To quote Margaret Pless,

41:57.640 --> 41:59.400
who covered this story for New York Magazine

41:59.400 --> 42:00.440
a few years ago,

42:00.440 --> 42:03.280
I think it might be A-log's all the way down.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.400
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-chan

42:06.400 --> 42:08.400
because to them she's a symbol

42:08.400 --> 42:10.680
of something they hate about themselves,

42:10.680 --> 42:12.120
something they're ashamed of.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.520
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,

42:14.520 --> 42:17.000
or being a socially awkward recluse.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.800
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,

42:19.800 --> 42:23.520
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,

42:23.520 --> 42:26.120
or embarrassing sexual proclivities,

42:26.120 --> 42:27.720
or all of the above.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.180
This is how scapegoating works, right?

42:30.180 --> 42:32.760
You repress your uncomfortable feelings

42:32.760 --> 42:36.120
of shame and insecurity and self-loathing,

42:36.120 --> 42:39.220
and you displace them onto someone else,

42:39.220 --> 42:42.060
usually someone you can feel superior to.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.340
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,

42:45.340 --> 42:48.840
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

42:48.840 --> 42:52.280
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

42:52.280 --> 42:55.420
It's pretty safe to assume that a large percentage

42:55.460 --> 42:57.300
of Christorians and trolls

42:57.300 --> 43:01.020
are some kind of social outcasts, much like Chris-chan.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.340
So bonding together over their shared contempt

43:04.340 --> 43:08.620
for Chris-chan is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

43:08.620 --> 43:10.800
of social rejection and exclusion.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.620
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people

43:13.620 --> 43:16.420
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

43:16.420 --> 43:18.980
contemptuous cringing helps us cope

43:18.980 --> 43:21.220
with our own shame and insecurity.

43:21.220 --> 43:24.060
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious empathizing

43:24.060 --> 43:27.420
with other people and find a way to make this all about me.

43:27.420 --> 43:29.420

43:37.420 --> 43:39.420

That's right, honey,

He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder

44:11.540 --> 44:13.140
of the things that you have seen.

44:13.140 --> 44:15.240
Actually, I identify as a trap.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.080
It's very that.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.180
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

44:19.180 --> 44:20.980
Cringe is failed seriousness.

44:20.980 --> 44:23.920
In my last video, I talked about how ashamed I am

44:24.780 --> 44:25.960
of being a transgender lesbian.

44:25.960 --> 44:26.840
Cringe.

44:26.840 --> 44:27.760
Shame.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.720
At the end of that video,

44:28.720 --> 44:31.080
I talk about how I sense that my shame

44:31.080 --> 44:34.040
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

44:34.040 --> 44:36.040
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

44:36.040 --> 44:39.240
particularly those of the heck-and-stripey-sock-nya-nya

44:39.240 --> 44:40.600
catgirl variety.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.000
But I confess to periodically sinking

44:43.000 --> 44:46.640
into these morbid, guilty binges of cringing

44:46.640 --> 44:48.560
at embarrassing trans lesbians.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.940
I want to return to that thought

44:49.940 --> 44:51.960
and kind of psychoanalyze myself

44:51.960 --> 44:54.200
as a kind of first-person case study

44:54.200 --> 44:55.860
of a morbid cringe obsession.

44:55.860 --> 45:00.640
So, catgirl trans girls are,

45:00.640 --> 45:02.860
okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

45:02.860 --> 45:05.600
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

45:05.600 --> 45:08.600
who express their identity online

45:08.600 --> 45:13.600
through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.280
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

45:16.280 --> 45:19.560
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

45:19.600 --> 45:22.160
as a kind of visual baby talk,

45:22.160 --> 45:24.920
an infantilized and unrealistic representation

45:24.920 --> 45:26.840
of femininity and womanhood

45:26.840 --> 45:29.600
that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.280
So when trans women identify with it, I cringe.

45:33.280 --> 45:37.040
Like, no, you can't become an anime girl, Lily.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.320
Fuck your dreams.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.280
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked

45:40.280 --> 45:42.320
with a discussion of whether my opinions

45:42.320 --> 45:44.680
about catgirls are fair or correct.

45:44.680 --> 45:47.720
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

45:47.720 --> 45:50.720
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.560
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

45:53.560 --> 45:56.840
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

45:56.840 --> 45:59.880
catgirls are being cringe online

45:59.880 --> 46:02.640
is a situation so inconsequential

46:02.640 --> 46:06.560
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it is too much.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.440
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

46:09.440 --> 46:13.000
Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.720
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

46:15.720 --> 46:18.280
for people who have traits in common with us,

46:18.280 --> 46:20.160
people who make us uncomfortable

46:20.160 --> 46:22.880
because we see something of ourselves in them.

46:22.880 --> 46:26.560
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

46:26.560 --> 46:29.320
Well, we're both trans women.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.960
We're both attracted to women.

46:31.960 --> 46:36.920
I do like anime, but I don't like the anime they like, okay?

46:36.920 --> 46:40.280
I like good anime that has mature,

46:40.280 --> 46:42.040
three-dimensional female characters.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.520
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.480
I'm not like you.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.320
It's also not lost on me that this is like

46:46.320 --> 46:47.960
the seventh time on this channel

46:47.960 --> 46:52.080
I've dressed as a catgirl to make fun of them.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.640
I have posted cringe.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.520
You should all be laughing at me right now.

46:58.520 --> 47:00.800
Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.960
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

47:02.960 --> 47:04.840
that I'm A-logging these catgirls.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.760
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.720
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

47:10.720 --> 47:13.480
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

47:13.480 --> 47:15.480
because of how these catgirls are acting.

47:15.480 --> 47:16.960
So let's make another distinction

47:16.960 --> 47:19.880
between in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.680
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

47:21.680 --> 47:24.080
who belongs to the same group identity as you,

47:24.080 --> 47:26.960
for example, your family, your romantic partnership,

47:26.960 --> 47:28.680
your ethnicity, or your country,

47:28.680 --> 47:31.040
particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

47:31.040 --> 47:33.200
in front of outsiders to the group.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.760
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

47:35.760 --> 47:38.520
if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.120
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

47:41.120 --> 47:42.320
when we talk to foreigners

47:42.320 --> 47:45.040
about Donald Trump being our president.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.440
Or think about these phrases.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.680
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.720
They're making trans people look bad.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.200
He's giving autistics a bad name.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.400
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

47:56.400 --> 47:58.800
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,

47:58.800 --> 48:00.800
we feel embarrassment,

48:00.800 --> 48:04.280
because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.

48:04.280 --> 48:08.080
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

48:08.080 --> 48:10.260
because you're cringing at your membership

48:10.260 --> 48:12.060
in an embarrassing group.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.260
Nothing has ever triggered

48:13.260 --> 48:15.860
this kind of in-group embarrassment more for me

48:15.860 --> 48:18.660
than a cringe video that went viral last year

48:18.660 --> 48:21.900
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

48:21.900 --> 48:24.460
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.020
You're gonna give me my fucking money back.

48:26.020 --> 48:28.980
Excuse me, sir, there's a young man in here.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.900
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.180
It is ma'am.

48:32.180 --> 48:35.700
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

48:35.700 --> 48:37.420
Motherfucker, take it outside.

48:37.420 --> 48:38.740
If you wanna call me sir again,

48:38.780 --> 48:40.980
I will show you a fucking sir.

48:40.980 --> 48:41.820
Motherfucker.

48:44.300 --> 48:46.300
The paradoxical absurdity

48:46.300 --> 48:48.980
of trying to brutishly intimidate people

48:48.980 --> 48:50.720
into seeing you as a woman.

48:53.420 --> 48:54.820
Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this

48:54.820 --> 48:57.060
and say Natalie hates trans women who don't pass.

48:57.060 --> 49:00.100
But passing is really not what this is about.

49:00.100 --> 49:05.020
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

49:05.020 --> 49:07.420
from a trans woman accompanied by

49:07.420 --> 49:11.100
apparently total delusion about how she's presenting.

49:11.100 --> 49:12.980
Well, I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time

49:12.980 --> 49:16.780
to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not.

49:16.780 --> 49:18.780
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

49:18.780 --> 49:21.100
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

49:21.100 --> 49:23.820
The incongruity between her thinking

49:23.820 --> 49:25.500
that she's serving women

49:25.500 --> 49:28.740
while bellowing like a drill sergeant.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.380
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

49:30.380 --> 49:32.180
this is cringe reaction content.

49:32.180 --> 49:33.540
I don't really do that on this channel,

49:33.540 --> 49:36.460
but I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

49:36.460 --> 49:39.820
And it feels good, like intoxicatingly good.

49:39.820 --> 49:41.980
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.580
I'm imagining myself right now surrounded by cis people

49:45.580 --> 49:47.780
and I am leading the righteous mob

49:47.780 --> 49:52.780
as we point and laugh at some delusional manly dump truck.

49:52.860 --> 49:56.260
I am a real transgender, a true transgender,

49:56.260 --> 49:57.820
a good transgender.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.860
Father finally approves of me.

49:59.860 --> 50:02.780
This would be the unconscious archetypal father.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.940
Jot that down in my progress notes, please, doctor.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.720
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

50:06.720 --> 50:09.060
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.940
When I watched that GameStop video,

50:10.940 --> 50:12.380
for the first few seconds,

50:12.380 --> 50:14.660
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.860
I can even relate,

50:15.860 --> 50:18.200
because in the first couple months of my transition,

50:18.200 --> 50:19.540
there was an occasion

50:19.540 --> 50:22.740
where I was in a lengthy customer service interaction

50:22.740 --> 50:27.100
where the guy at the desk was calling me sir the entire time.

50:27.100 --> 50:28.740
And there's something very humiliating

50:28.740 --> 50:30.660
about trying to present female,

50:30.660 --> 50:32.420
like wearing a dress and makeup,

50:32.420 --> 50:34.420
and yet being called sir.

50:34.420 --> 50:37.340
It's a quintessential mismatch between self-concept

50:37.340 --> 50:38.980
and the way other people are seeing you.

50:38.980 --> 50:41.100
And the memory of it is painful to me,

50:41.100 --> 50:43.900
but what I cling to is that,

50:43.900 --> 50:46.100
while I may have looked like a man,

50:46.100 --> 50:48.700
at least I didn't act like a man.

50:48.700 --> 50:51.340
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

50:51.340 --> 50:52.780
and show them a sir.

50:52.780 --> 50:56.100
In fact, I was too ashamed even to correct the guy.

50:56.100 --> 50:58.620
So as the GameStop video progresses,

50:58.620 --> 51:00.460
my sympathy runs out fast.

51:00.460 --> 51:02.340
And instead of compassionate cringe,

51:02.340 --> 51:04.420
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

51:04.420 --> 51:05.500
including myself.

51:05.500 --> 51:09.180
And I feel contempt toward this individual

51:09.180 --> 51:10.780
for making us all look bad.

51:10.780 --> 51:15.100
I also feel a kind of morbid fascination rooted in fear.

51:15.100 --> 51:17.720
What if I'm as delusional as that trans woman?

51:17.720 --> 51:19.680
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

51:19.680 --> 51:21.700
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.840
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

51:23.840 --> 51:26.620
listening to recordings of my voice just to make sure.

51:26.620 --> 51:29.420
And that fear motivates me to distance myself

51:29.420 --> 51:30.920
from that person in the video.

51:30.920 --> 51:32.520
I don't feel compassion for her,

51:32.520 --> 51:34.360
because that would mean putting myself

51:34.360 --> 51:36.000
in her size 16 shoes.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.480
And I don't want to do that,

51:37.480 --> 51:39.760
because I'm horrified and repulsed by the thought

51:39.760 --> 51:41.880
that I'm like her in some way.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.440
So I want to push away.

51:43.440 --> 51:46.800
And contempt is a way of emotionally distancing myself.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.480
And if I express that contempt by publicly shaming

51:49.480 --> 51:50.680
and condemning her,

51:50.680 --> 51:53.360
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.040
Accidental COVID jokes.

51:55.040 --> 51:55.880
Oops.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.080
Guess it's, uh, contagious.

51:58.920 --> 52:01.040
I think many people who are stigmatized

52:01.040 --> 52:03.640
or who have been humiliated long

52:03.640 --> 52:06.240
for the experience of being a normal,

52:06.240 --> 52:08.440
surrounded by fellow normals,

52:08.440 --> 52:11.040
judging and humiliating a freak.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.160
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

52:13.160 --> 52:15.800
a lot of the biggest creators in the platform

52:15.800 --> 52:18.200
have channels basically devoted

52:18.200 --> 52:22.060
to exactly this type of cringe-reaction humilitainment.

52:22.060 --> 52:24.320
The YouTuber Calvin Guerra is a trans guy

52:24.320 --> 52:26.240
who's best known for what are essentially

52:26.240 --> 52:27.920
cringe-reaction videos,

52:28.760 --> 52:31.240
mostly aimed at people he deems trans-trenders.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.520
That is, people who claim to be trans,

52:33.520 --> 52:36.600
but who aren't real transgenders like Calvin.

52:36.600 --> 52:39.720
He's especially bothered by girly, AFAB,

52:39.720 --> 52:41.720
trans and non-binary teenagers,

52:41.720 --> 52:43.760
or by anyone who blurs the line

52:43.760 --> 52:46.640
between lesbian and trans-masculine identities.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.360
Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction

52:48.360 --> 52:50.760
to a specific person who grinds his gears.

52:50.760 --> 52:54.680
So this person is an asexual, non-binary,

52:54.680 --> 52:59.680
transgender lesbian who uses he, they, it, thons pronouns.

53:01.640 --> 53:05.640
According to my calculations, you are a trans-trender.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.560
And other times he'll basically just laugh

53:07.560 --> 53:09.800
at cringy trans TikTok teens.

53:09.800 --> 53:14.120
No, no, I'm turning off the video.

53:14.120 --> 53:15.440
I can't watch this.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.200
He has a couple justifications for making these videos.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.440
One is that he's actually helping

53:19.440 --> 53:20.840
the people he's cringing at,

53:20.840 --> 53:22.780
because if a trender transitions,

53:22.780 --> 53:25.420
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detransition.

53:25.420 --> 53:28.820
But I have to wonder, does humiliating or laughing at people

53:28.820 --> 53:31.460
really help them figure out whether they're trans or not?

53:31.460 --> 53:33.740
His other justification is that trans-trenders

53:33.740 --> 53:36.180
are giving real trans people a bad name.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.100
They're the reason people are transphobic.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.860
This is why they hate us.

53:39.860 --> 53:42.300
It's because of the trenders.

53:42.300 --> 53:44.940
Wow, I love that idea of a true-scum furry.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.700
Isn't that just, isn't that just wonderful?

53:47.700 --> 53:49.820
A true-scum furry!

53:49.820 --> 53:51.100
But it's not, though.

53:51.100 --> 53:53.580
I mean, transphobia existed long before

53:53.580 --> 53:55.460
there were people you could plausibly describe

53:55.460 --> 53:56.700
as trans-trenders.

53:56.700 --> 53:58.660
So trans-trenders aren't the reason

53:58.660 --> 54:00.780
society hates trans people, Calvin.

54:00.780 --> 54:02.740
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

54:02.740 --> 54:04.260
Or at least the trans community.

54:04.260 --> 54:06.060
And I feel like what you're doing is you're projecting

54:06.060 --> 54:07.740
that feeling onto society at large,

54:07.740 --> 54:10.020
and you're saying, oh, this is the reason

54:10.020 --> 54:11.340
people are transphobic.

54:11.340 --> 54:14.020
And to be fair, I get that it's not just a projection.

54:14.020 --> 54:17.100
Like back in 2016, the SJW cringe era,

54:17.100 --> 54:19.420
it was cis people mocking trans people

54:19.420 --> 54:20.700
with all these tropes.

54:20.700 --> 54:23.620
Attack helicopter, two genders, 76 genders,

54:23.620 --> 54:24.820
special snowflakes.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.980
But now, they're used by trans people

54:26.980 --> 54:28.740
trying to distance themselves,

54:28.740 --> 54:31.140
trying to ghettoize the most laughed-at people

54:31.140 --> 54:33.940
in the community under the label of trans-trenders.

54:33.940 --> 54:35.500
And Calvin, there may be some truth

54:35.500 --> 54:37.780
to what you're saying about there being confused teenagers

54:37.780 --> 54:39.500
who think they're trans when they're not.

54:39.500 --> 54:40.460
I mean, I wouldn't know.

54:40.460 --> 54:42.500
I'm a near-dead woman in the twilight of my life,

54:42.500 --> 54:43.860
and I don't hang out with teenagers.

54:43.860 --> 54:45.420
But even if it is true, Calvin,

54:45.420 --> 54:48.600
your fixation on it seems disproportionate to me.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.520
Like, you return to this topic to cringe again,

54:51.520 --> 54:54.200
and again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.240
It's like you're picking at a wound.

54:56.240 --> 54:58.840
It feels to me like a morbid cringe obsession.

54:58.840 --> 55:02.360
And I guess I think I recognize part of myself in you.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.060
This could be me projecting, of course,

55:04.060 --> 55:06.180
but I wonder if the way you feel

55:06.180 --> 55:08.800
about girly, sparkle-gender AFABs

55:08.800 --> 55:10.680
is similar to the way I feel

55:10.680 --> 55:13.400
about otaku, trans-bian cat girls.

55:13.400 --> 55:15.760
And it might be worth considering that

55:15.760 --> 55:18.400
I don't cringe at the sparkle-genders the way you do.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.000
I mean, I'm with you on wondering

55:20.000 --> 55:23.320
what a he-they-zeer-gender-flux-lesbian-demi-boy is,

55:23.320 --> 55:24.880
but unlike you, Calvin,

55:24.880 --> 55:27.140
I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

55:27.140 --> 55:29.040
with feminine AFAB trans people.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.840
They can identify as however many genders

55:30.840 --> 55:32.080
they want for all I care.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.640
I may not always understand it,

55:33.640 --> 55:35.840
but I support their journey.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.360
I guess it doesn't bother me,

55:37.360 --> 55:40.000
because I'm not worried that anyone will judge me

55:40.000 --> 55:41.520
because of how they behave.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.200
I don't feel in-group cringe.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.280
Now it's a different story.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.440
If I'm reading a general lesbian subreddit

55:46.600 --> 55:48.200
and I see a comment like,

55:48.200 --> 55:50.760
pre-transition trans-lesbian here.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.280
I wish I had titties.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.920
Girl, dick, nya nya.

55:53.920 --> 55:55.600
Get the fuck out of here, Billy.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.000
You're giving real trans-lesbians a bad name.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.560
This is why they hate us.

55:59.560 --> 56:02.080
See, now I have strong feelings.

56:02.080 --> 56:04.160
Now I'm in-group cringing.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.760
And intellectually, I do think my feelings are correct

56:07.760 --> 56:08.720
to some extent.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.600
Like, I don't think a general lesbian community

56:11.600 --> 56:14.500
is the appropriate forum for a trans woman

56:14.540 --> 56:16.980
who's effectively still living as a man

56:16.980 --> 56:19.980
to take the mic and whine about wanting titties

56:19.980 --> 56:22.100
or rhapsodize about girl dick.

56:22.100 --> 56:25.780
But I'm also aware that I feel this strongly about this

56:25.780 --> 56:29.180
because of my own dysphoria and my own shame.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.780
And honestly, my own self-loathing.

56:31.780 --> 56:35.400
Like, I can't even talk to cis women on dating apps

56:35.400 --> 56:37.100
because I feel like a fake woman

56:37.100 --> 56:39.300
imposing myself on real women.

56:39.300 --> 56:40.420
That's where my head is at.

56:40.420 --> 56:44.160
So where does this pre-transition trans-lesbian

56:44.160 --> 56:45.600
get the audacity?

56:45.600 --> 56:47.440
You know, it makes me feel in-group cringe

56:47.440 --> 56:50.280
about an identity, trans-lesbianism,

56:50.280 --> 56:53.880
which for me is already a pain point of insecurity

56:53.880 --> 56:55.760
and embarrassment and shame.

56:55.760 --> 56:59.320
So Calvin, maybe, and again, I could just be projecting,

56:59.320 --> 57:01.280
but maybe that's kind of like

57:01.280 --> 57:03.140
how you feel about these trenders.

57:03.140 --> 57:04.880
When you make these videos condemning them

57:04.880 --> 57:08.540
as not really trans, aren't you essentially exiling them

57:08.540 --> 57:11.140
from the in-group so you no longer feel the pain

57:11.140 --> 57:12.560
of in-group cringe?

57:12.600 --> 57:15.580
Or perhaps, Calvin Garrah,

57:15.580 --> 57:18.040
what you're really trying to destroy

57:18.040 --> 57:20.120
is the trender within.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.920
And again, I could be full of shit here.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.080
At the end of the day,

57:25.080 --> 57:28.200
this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber I haven't met.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.760
So feel free to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin,

57:30.760 --> 57:34.560
but still, I guess I invite you to consider

57:34.560 --> 57:37.800
whether producing trans-trender humilitainment

57:37.800 --> 57:39.640
is actually helping anything

57:39.640 --> 57:42.540
or whether it's really just an addictive way

57:42.540 --> 57:45.240
to scratch some kind of emotional itch.

57:45.240 --> 57:47.520
All right, I've said my piece about Calvin.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.360
Who's next?

57:48.360 --> 57:52.120
Oh, how about Vanessa?

57:52.120 --> 57:53.680
We meet again, gorge.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.000
And once again, I'm wearing some kind

57:55.000 --> 57:57.040
of embarrassing anime hairpiece.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.600
Vanessa is a trans woman who is

57:59.600 --> 58:02.760
the second most popular political trans YouTuber.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.560
At least that's what I wrote in the script

58:04.560 --> 58:06.240
when I had more subscribers than her

58:06.240 --> 58:08.520
and was fully prepared to be a cunt about it,

58:08.520 --> 58:12.640
but since then, she has in fact surpassed me once again.

58:12.640 --> 58:13.680
Good for her.

58:13.680 --> 58:16.680
Vanessa started out as basically a cringe reaction channel

58:16.680 --> 58:18.960
back when SJW cringe was fashionable.

58:18.960 --> 58:21.280
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

58:21.280 --> 58:23.820
but the most consistent theme was trans-trenders

58:23.820 --> 58:27.240
and crazy activists are giving real trans people a bad name.

58:27.240 --> 58:28.640
They're making us look bad.

58:28.640 --> 58:30.440
This is why people hate us.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.080
So what we can now recognize

58:32.080 --> 58:34.680
as a standard in-group cringe fixation.

58:34.680 --> 58:37.360
But Vanessa focused in particular

58:37.400 --> 58:42.400
on a strident, SJW-type trans woman called Riley Dennis.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.880
And Vanessa made several reaction videos to her

58:45.880 --> 58:48.600
where she made a point of misgendering Riley

58:48.600 --> 58:51.880
and dismissing her as a fake transgender

58:51.880 --> 58:56.240
who hadn't transitioned and clearly had no intention to.

58:56.240 --> 58:59.120
You know, if you went on estrogen,

58:59.120 --> 59:00.480
your sex drive wouldn't be so high

59:00.480 --> 59:01.840
and you wouldn't be guilt-tripping people

59:01.840 --> 59:03.840
into having sex with you.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.680
Just saying.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.480
Then, Riley made a video revealing

59:07.480 --> 59:10.120
that she'd been on hormone therapy for a year

59:10.120 --> 59:13.480
and was about to undergo facial feminization surgery.

59:13.480 --> 59:16.480
This prompted Vanessa to make an apology video

59:16.480 --> 59:18.760
where she not only apologized to Riley

59:18.760 --> 59:20.400
and acknowledged her transition,

59:20.400 --> 59:22.480
but she actually went beyond the script

59:22.480 --> 59:25.200
of a generic oopsie-doopsie YouTube video

59:25.200 --> 59:28.280
and opened up about having experienced herself

59:28.280 --> 59:30.560
the cruelty she directed at Riley.

59:30.600 --> 59:33.280
And I'm someone who's had my transition

59:33.280 --> 59:34.800
picked apart online.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.000
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads

59:37.000 --> 59:38.800
with hundreds of comments on it

59:38.800 --> 59:40.720
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans

59:40.720 --> 59:42.480
because I haven't done this or that

59:42.480 --> 59:45.080
or, you know, digging up my old pictures.

59:45.080 --> 59:47.760
And so the thought that this entire time

59:47.760 --> 59:51.800
I've done that exact same thing to someone else

59:51.800 --> 59:54.400
and pushed that off on someone else

59:54.400 --> 59:57.120
fucks with me and I'm fucking sorry.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.040
Vanessa actually managed, for one fleeting moment,

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.160
to make a connection between her own past hurt and trauma

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.520
and the pain she'd inflicted on another person,

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.000
which is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime event

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.920
on a website where the performers are remorseless psychopaths

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.960
who wouldn't muddy their shoes to save a drowning child

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.440
and the viewers are cold-blooded sadists

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.040
who consume human misery like a glutton,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.000
gorging himself at a particularly sumptuous buffet.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.400
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.080
that I should really try to stick to ideas,

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.240
opinions, policy.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.480
However, this lesson would not last.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.680
Vanessa kept doing SJW cringe content

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.680
well past the point it had become passé,

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.560
making a video with Big Red in the thumbnail

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.800
as recently as 2019.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.280
I admit, I thought she was fading into irrelevance,

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.480
but once again, I underestimated Vanessa.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.180
In July 2019, her channel rocketed

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.320
to a new level of success when she released a video

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.200
titled Exposing Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.120
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm about a trans woman,

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.920
or rather, she believes, a man posing as a trans woman

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.120
called Jessica Yaniv.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.440
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.200
Well, as far as I can tell,

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.880
everything Vanessa says about Yaniv is true.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.500
Yaniv attempted to use a Canadian human rights tribunal

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.480
to close down several beauty salons

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.880
that had refused to wax her hairy balls

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.600
after she approached them about it

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.320
in an awkward and creepy way.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.920
She has a long history of sending

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.960
extremely inappropriate messages to underage girls.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.760
And she attempted to host a topless pool party

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.000
for unchaperoned children.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.640
Basically, Yaniv is someone who appropriates

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.840
the language of transgender acceptance and equality

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.120
to cloak predatory behavior toward minors.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.280
And my read on Yaniv, by the way,

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.880
is not that she's a cunning manipulator,

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.000
but that this is someone who is mentally

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.080
not playing with a full deck.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.320
After the success of her initial video,

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.960
Vanessa made a few more videos about Yaniv

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.960
rebranding herself as a kind of transsexual Chris Hansen,

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.960
exposing transgender predators wherever she could find them.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.120
And at first, I was honestly kind of loving this for Vanessa.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.960
At least now she's finally picking on someone

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.040
who deserves it.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.280
But the more I think about it, the more hesitations I have.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.540
One is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv story

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.400
and the lack of attention given to it

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.320
by other trans public figures

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.640
as an indictment of trans activists,

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.800
who Vanessa thinks should spend more time

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.680
sounding the alarm about

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.880
TRANSGENDER PREDATORS.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.840
And I'm willing to admit,

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.400
there's probably a valid point in there somewhere.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.620
Like, some trans people really are so paranoid

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.920
about transphobes framing all of us as dangerous perverts

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.280
that they basically look the other way

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.440
and refuse to acknowledge the small but real subset

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.280
of trans people who are, in fact, dangerous perverts.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.800
But Blair, you talk about the Yaniv situation

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.960
like it's urgent breaking news,

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.640
like Yaniv should rightfully be a household name,

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.840
but for the stubborn silence of trans activists.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.160
But why?

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.320
Why should everyone be focused on Jessica Yaniv?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.740
There's more than 100,000 sexual assaults

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.560
reported to American law enforcement every year.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.800
The literal president of America

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.360
is a bit of a sexual predator himself.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.280
Why fixate on this one particular Canadian creep?

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.400
I guess you could argue that since Yaniv

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.560
is a trans-identified predator, a tip.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.040
We as real trans people have a responsibility

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.440
to be the ones who lead the charge to stop her.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.660
Or at least it would be good optics for us to do that.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.240
And again, I think there's maybe some truth to that.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.920
Like, initially, the LGBT website Pink News

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.360
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's claims of discrimination,

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.080
which is pretty embarrassing and not great optics,

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.520
but I don't think that constantly broadcasting updates

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.960
about the transgender threat

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.380
is really the best optics for us either.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.280
Why did Vanessa make this video in the first place?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.960
Is it simply because she cares deeply

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.200
about the well-being of children

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.920
and she thought making a video

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.860
exposing Jessica Yaniv is the best way to protect them?

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.080
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little bit about the children,

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.480
but it's still a YouTube video, and you have to ask,

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.480
is the primary intention here really to stop a predator?

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.480
Or is it to manufacture a sleazy entertainment spectacle?

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.000
Shortly after her first Yaniv video was published,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.440
Vanessa hosted a livestream on her channel

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.440
titled Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv, Trans Predator.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.680
This got two million views.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.520
Is this what you do

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.680
with someone you've just accused of pedophilia?

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.000
You host a live event debating the pedophile

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.640
on your YouTube channel?

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.120
What's to debate?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.120
I don't need to be scared in my own house

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.400
that I'm gonna get fucking attacked

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.160
and I'm gonna have to pay money,

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.400
which is illegal in Canada, just saying, but.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.960
You think that was, like, cute?

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.640
Was that a moment for you?

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.800
Then, of course, you sell T-shirts

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.720
featuring the meme that resulted

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.520
from your YouTube pedophile debate.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.960
I mean, that makes sense.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.000
If you're gonna catch a predator,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.640
you gotta sell pedophile debate merch.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.360
And of course, you gotta follow

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.360
the pedophile's makeup tutorial, you know, for the children.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.440
Now, I hate to be overly critical,

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.040
but when I look at this,

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.640
I don't see a high-minded activist

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.120
working to protect children and trans people's image.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.240
I see a tabloid entertainer

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.480
who's discovered a way to monetize milking lols

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.880
from a mentally defective pervert.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.960
And I have to say, Blair, as a connoisseur of trash myself,

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.240
I'm very entertained by all of this.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.280
Following a sexual predator's makeup tutorial?

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.040
That's genius.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.560
I wish I'd thought of that.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.240
But just be honest.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.920
This isn't activism.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.080
This isn't justice.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.880
It's a lolcow cult.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.520
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals took over the show,

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.960
and I love that for her.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.920
I love that for her.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.240
But Blair, I can't help but notice

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.620
you're still hitting all the same beats

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.640
your videos have always hit.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.680
Attention, everyone.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.000
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.360
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.960
It's very important that we all gather around

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.840
to condemn this bad transgender

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.920
who is not a real transgender.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.560
And Blair, I'll give you this.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.920
You are getting better at choosing your targets.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.760
The transvestite monster is a stock character in our culture

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.160
and Jessica Yeniv is good casting for the part.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.040
She's a transphobe's boogeyman come to life,

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.600
and I certainly am not shedding any tears for her.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.640
But you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this seriously

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.260
as anything more than a smarter version

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.800
of the same in-group cringe humilitainment

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.480
you've always made.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.920
And by the way, you may wanna check in

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.480
on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.680
Rose of Dawn is another conservative trans woman YouTuber

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.840
who produces a series called Trans Stupid.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.320
Hi, everyone, and welcome to another edition

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.440
of Trans Stupid, the show where I take a look

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.480
at the wonderful world of LGBTQIA++ news

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.960
because stupidity is intersectional.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.880
Transgender?

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.740
More like trans-retarded.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.180
More like trans-gay.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.800
Trans-gay, I love that.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.300
I'm literally, I just realized I'm literally trans-gay.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.540
Rose's channel is allegedly about the excesses

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.940
of trans ideology and activism,

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.100
which in theory I do think is a perspective

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.100
worth including in the conversation.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.500
But in practice, well, let's just say,

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.140
Rose has produced a 30-minute documentary

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.260
about why Chris Chan is not a real transgender.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.460
There is a bad transgender in our midst.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.980
The bad transgender is not a real transgender like me.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.300
I'm getting pretty tired of this.

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.100
And here's her transition advice

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.540
to trans women just beginning their journey.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:40.980
You probably have this image in your head

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.100
that you're going to be this really cute-looking trans woman.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.460
Like, effectively, you're going to be this seal.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.620
Like, look at this seal.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.740
Isn't this seal adorable?

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.500
Look, you're so cute.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.140
But the truth is, you're probably not looking

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.940
like this seal right now, are you?

01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:00.180
You're probably more like this big bull seal

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.620
barging your way into women's bathrooms saying,

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.580
this is a woman's body.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:10.400
Now, you might never reach the cute seal phase.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.180
In fact, very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.180
Rose, no.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.820
Do not simp for Vanessa.

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.260
It only encourages her.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.960
She's also made no less than 20 videos about Jessica Yaniv,

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.520
which seems like kind of a lot, Gorge.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.000
Would I be wrong to say I'm getting

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.560
a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction vibe?

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.760
In these videos, Rose chronicles Yaniv's

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.880
numerous crimes and wrongdoings,

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.760
but she also cannot resist making it very clear

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.600
how disgusted she is with Yaniv's appearance.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.640
The irony being that this kind of tweet

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.720
came from someone who you can smell

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.800
just by looking at a picture of them.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.440
I bring this up, again, not because I have any interest

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.000
at all in white knighting for Yaniv.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.680
I do not support her journey.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.340
As far as I'm concerned, she can eat shit,

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.640
and maybe she does.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.000
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.920
No, my point is that part of the catharsis

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.240
that Rose and Vanessa seem to derive

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.740
from making this kind of content

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.280
comes from contrasting themselves

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.480
as good, presentable, real trans people

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.480
with the hideousness of the wretched fake trans dump truck.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.520
A classic Vanessa thumbnail is divided into two halves.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.280
On one half, Vanessa.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.620
Looking fish, looking cunt.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.320
Always with her lip gloss in the live streams.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.760
And in the other half of the thumbnail, for contrast,

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.680
the tragic dump truck in a maladjusted wig.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.180
And I'm allowed to say dump truck

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.000
because before I transitioned,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.900
I was one of Vanessa's dump trucks.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.180
I was one of, hashtag, her dump trucks.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.880
Look, I happen to possess a little thing

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.320
you probably haven't heard of it

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.640
called inner beauty.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.620
That's right, sweetie, my pancreas, unclockable.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.480
♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ah ♪

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.720
Meanwhile, Rose, who prefers to represent herself

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.480
with this cartoon, okay,

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.960
straight up refers to Yaniv as the tubby trune

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.280
and the titanic tranner of Canada.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.640
A particular titanic tranner of Canada.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.120
The titanic tranner of Canada.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.800
Tranner and trune being pejoratives for transgender

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.080
that I associate with 4chan,

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.300
where I'm guessing Rose has spent a lot of time.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.640
As for the emphatic revulsion toward Yaniv's fatness,

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.680
well, I'm guessing that must be another important part

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.360
of stopping a predator, right?

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.920
It seems almost taboo to condemn people

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.440
for how rough they look

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.280
when I think that that tough love in a way is needed

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.480
because I look at what I looked like

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.800
when I first transitioned

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.240
and Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.840
Like, I looked bad.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.200
Like, I was overweight.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.320
I had a poor taste in clothes.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.640
Like, I was never wearing stupid dresses or anything.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.280
It was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.320
You're probably more like this big bull scene

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.920
barging your way into women's bathrooms

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.720
saying, this is a woman's body.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.200
Now, you might never reach me.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.920
You'd see the face, in fact,

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.240
very few of us turn out to look like black whites.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.320
And I want to make it very clear

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.440
that when I'm talking about transition,

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.200
I don't mean that you're-

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.120
Rose, are you okay?

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.760
No, you're not okay.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.160
None of us are okay.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.920
No trans woman remotely in the public eye

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.720
is in any way okay.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.640
And look, I don't want to take the psychoanalysis too far

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.120
because I don't know from watching YouTube videos

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.760
what's going on in someone's head,

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.480
but I can try to make intelligent inferences.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.320
And I think it's pretty revealing

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.160
that this is how Rose introduces the topic

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.520
of Jessica Yaniv.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.200
I think, well, one of the biggest characters

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.720
in the whole fucking world at the moment,

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.040
which is Jessica Yaniv.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.440
Rose, Gorge,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.960
Jessica Yaniv is not one of

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.040
the biggest characters in the whole world at any moment.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.520
This is not a world historical figure.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.840
At the end of the day,

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.680
this is a more or less random civilian sex fiend

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.760
off the streets of Vancouver, BC.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.960
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.760
is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch a predator

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.360
and turn this grimy reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.640
She is not one of the most important characters

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.480
in the world,

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.720
but it sounds like what she is, Rose,

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.920
is one of the most important characters in your brain.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.560
This is distorted thinking.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.320
It's like A-Log comparing Chris-Chan to Hitler.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.720
You're so deep in the morbid cringe obsession

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.320
that you've lost perspective.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.000
And I'm sure you have what seemed to you

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.880
like perfectly logical reasons

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.040
why you're devoting so much attention to this.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.520
And I know videos about Yaniv get a lot of views,

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.120
so I'm sure that's a factor too.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.240
But Rose, I also know a morbid cringe obsession

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.120
when I see one.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.400
And I know that being a visible trans woman on the internet

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.000
is more difficult than most people can imagine.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.640
And I know that pretty much every trans person

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.760
is bullied or shamed or humiliated

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.360
at some point in our lives.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.680
And I know how good it can feel

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.600
to take all the horrible things transphobes and bullies

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.640
and TERFs have said about us

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.640
and repeat them verbatim about some big, fat, fake,

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.440
dangerous, delusional, disgusting male fetishist.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.320
Oh, it feels good to be the TERF for once.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.760
It feels good to be the judge rather than the judged.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.000
Because when you point the finger at someone else,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.280
you're also pointing away from yourself.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.280
And it's not lost on me that in conservative circles,

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.640
queer people are often treated

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.240
like suspected sex criminals by default.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.940
So there's safety in being the one who spearheads

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.440
the think-of-the-children type moral crusade.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.560
And when you expose a trans predator,

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.240
you get that feeling of safety plus the relief

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.040
of having someone in particular to blame

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.440
for the shame and stigma we all feel.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.760
Jessica Yaniv is the reason people hate us,

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.160
but that's just not true.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.000
It's a simple answer to a complicated problem.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.640
It's scapegoating.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.760
When I look at the Yaniv obsession on trans YouTube,

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.600
I see a community trying to cope with stigma

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.280
and hoping that destroying a scapegoat will bring relief.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.080
It's basically a blood sacrifice.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.520
It's not rational.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.000
It feels good for a moment, but it's an addiction.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.960
It won't ever erase the stigma and the shame.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.480
And Yaniv is simply the latest and most deserving

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.680
in a long line of bad transgenders

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.920
who aren't real transgenders and are giving us a bad name

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.520
and are the reason people hate us

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.760
and must be condemned and destroyed.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.840
But when Yaniv is finally gone,

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.440
when you get her sent to prison or whatever your goal is,

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.600
you're just gonna find a new scapegoat to take her place.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.800
And the shame cycle continues.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.360
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.040
is internalized as shame.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.240
When we project that shame onto scapegoats

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.800
and onto each other, it becomes cringing and contempt,

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.440
and we voice that contempt by shaming other people,

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.280
which starts a new cycle.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.440
So you can keep finding new scapegoats, new punching bags,

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.360
new shame dumps, new lolcows,

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.040
and you can end up like one of the people

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.000
who's been archiving Chris Chan for 13 years,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.160
but that will never really heal us.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.920
God, how do I get out of this video?

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.400
Ugh, I'm trying to have a serious conversation

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.360
dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.320
Cringe.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.160
Shame.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.540
I'm ashamed.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.380
Don't look at me.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.040
You know, I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.840
Thank you, yes, I suppose it is groundbreaking.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.480
All right, children, let's review our notes on cringe.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.560
The word cringe really describes two different emotions,

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.680
either embarrassment or contempt.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.040
You can feel either one for yourself or for someone else.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.720
When you're embarrassed for someone else,

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.600
we call that vicarious embarrassment.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.440
And that can mean cringing with someone

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.720
who is embarrassed themselves,

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.680
which I've argued is excluded

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.760
in the internet usage of the word cringe.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.920
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.920
who isn't embarrassed themselves,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.440
in which case we say we're cringing at them.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.240
Now if someone who's part of your in-group

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.680
is embarrassing themselves,

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.180
and by proxy, embarrassing the in-group that includes you,

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.080
you feel in-group cringe,

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.880
which can involve both vicarious embarrassment

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.920
and a kind of self-cringe.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.200
And on the contempt side,

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.240
contempt for someone who shares traits in common with you,

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.480
particularly if they're traits

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480
you have contempt for in yourself,

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.800
can develop into morbid cringe,

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.960
which is that obsession with a lolcow,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.560
that addiction to contemptuous gazing at a dark mirror

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.840
in which you see reflected

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.080
everything you hate about yourself or about your in-group.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
Now I wanna end this video by reflecting

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.440
on whether cringe is good or bad, healthy or harmful.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.960
And I do think that in some situations, cringe is good.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.360
Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.880
It helps us interact smoothly with each other

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.780
by telling us what not to do.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.300
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing stories

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.360
can be cathartic.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.600
It can make you feel closer to other people,

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.480
more alike, less alone.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.840
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:15.840
is very healthy.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.560
It shows you're self-aware,

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.220
and you care at least a little bit what other people think.

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.760
You know, I've met people who never cringe at themselves,

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.000
and let's just say they're not my kind of people.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.120
They're narcissists who think super highly of themselves,

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.560
regardless of how they're actually coming across.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.240
But I think partly out of fear

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.340
of ending up like one of those people,

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.400
I've overcompensated, and I cringe too much,

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.680
both at myself and at other people.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.160
It's a habit that's kind of making me hate myself,

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.460
and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.060
And when I take a look around the internet,

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.000
like I've done in this video,

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.400
I find that I'm not alone in this situation,

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.720
and it's not cute.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.880
So how do we cringe less?

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.240
Well, the cliche solution is self-love,

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.560
which our culture places a lot of value on.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560
Self-love and self-esteem.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.800
You know, I don't care what haters and losers say.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.200
I'm a bad bitch.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.840
I look like a supermodel.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.440
I'm a genius.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.040
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way,

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.540
but it doesn't work, because it's not realistic.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:20.440
You don't look like a supermodel, and you're not a genius.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.720
And when you realize that,

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.640
you fall from one extreme to the other

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.000
of what Chris Fleming calls

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.160
the self-esteem tower of terror.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.560
You go from self-love to self-hate.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.760
But self-hate is also a distortion.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.680
Recently, I was listening

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.760
to a David Foster Wallace interview.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.280
Yeah, I know, cringe.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.840
And he attacked me mercilessly and unprovoked.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.760
There's a lot of narcissism in self-hatred.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.280
How dare you notice that?

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.560
I'm in this photo, and I don't like it.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.880
But it's true.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.000
Time spent cringing at yourself

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.040
is still time spent obsessing over yourself.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.800
And it's hard not to, because humans are animals,

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.040
so our perspective is egocentric by nature.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.280
But we can still learn to appreciate

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.320
that the world is bigger than us.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.480
I mean, I've heard rumors.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.920
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.400
Melissa Dahl advocates not self-love or self-hate,

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.320
but what she calls self-indifference.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.160
She says,

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.920
Self-indifference is the relief of realizing

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.480
that you are simply not that big a deal.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.920
So yeah, I was pretty cringey in the past,

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.520
and I'm still pretty cringey now.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.960
But you know what?

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.360
Everyone else is pretty cringey too.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.840
And the world's probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.560
so I don't know if I would call this good news,

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.020
but if it's any consolation,

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.080
nothing matters.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.000
Nothing matters.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.800
Nothing matters.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.480
Nothing matters.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.240
Nothing matters.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.120
Nothing matters.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.080
Nothing matters.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.400
Nothing matters.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.000
Nothing matters.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.840
Nothing matters.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.720
Nothing matters.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.720
Nothing matters.
